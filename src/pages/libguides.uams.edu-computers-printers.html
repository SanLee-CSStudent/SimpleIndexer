Wireless Access Wireless Internet access is available throughout the library. If you are a guest in the library you will connect to the UAMS Guest account from your device.

There is no charge for this service. How to scan in the Library: Activate the printer with your UAMS badge Press the home symbol key on the screen (it looks like a house) then select SCAN. The document will be scanned into a PDF format. DPI resolution and single or double side can be selected at this screen, as well Insert the document face-up in the document feed tray on top of the printer or place the document pages on the glass-top (face-down). Press 'start' When the scanning is complete, the document will be emailed to your UAMS email address. If you need assistance with any of our scanning equipment, please check with the staff at the Circulation Desk. Equipment Options As technology has become mobile, so has the need for supporting these mobile devices. Many students regularly use laptops and iPads in the library for individual study or with a group. The library is equipped with large screen televisions in the Active Learning Center and in the group study rooms. To make it possible for our students to utilize these large screens the library provides HDMI cables that can be checked out. Connecting the HDMI cable to a laptop and the screen allows students to share information with a group. We also have adapters for iPads and older apple devices. Need a quick charge for your phone, but forgot your cable? We have both Android and Apple charging stations available on first floor near the Watson room in the Active Learning Center, on second floor near the Administrative Office, and on third floor south in the Quiet\/Study area.
