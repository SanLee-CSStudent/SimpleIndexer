Field of Interest Do you love expressing your emotions through artistic movement? If the artistic outlet that dance offers appeals to you, then you should consider a career in the performing arts industry. We offer two pathways in the Dance program. If you\u2019d like to pursue a career in dance performance, choreography, teaching, and fitness instruction, consider the AAFA in Dance, which provides the first two years of a four-year curriculum. You'll have the opportunity to become skilled at incorporating kinesthetic and somatic principles of movement into various dance styles, as well as apply artistic elements to your dance like intention, movement quality, connection, musicality, and so much more! We will teach you how to critically analyze and evaluate choreography, technique, and performance, and provide written and oral feedback. If you\u2019d like to diversify your dance portfolio, consider the AAS in Dance Performance and Technology, which integrates performance, technology, kinesiology, and real world application into the Dance program. Our goal is to teach you how to survive in the 21st century dance industry with conservatory style dance training coupled with practical skills outside of the studio to support a career in the arts. We provide training in dance theory, technique, performance, dance for camera, and production. You\u2019ll also have the opportunity to learn how to edit and create digital music, create marketing materials, and use computer technology for the dance industry.
