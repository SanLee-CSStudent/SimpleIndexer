A single meal is something many people take for granted but for several families and children in the Auburn area, food insecurity is a very real problem. Human Development and Family Science students at Auburn University are stepping in to help through the Summer Sustenance Project that is gaining momentum with each passing month. The project actually began last Thanksgiving when students in Caroline Payne-Purvis\u2019 Human Development and Family Sciences class came up with an idea to try and help two families in need during the holiday. Bailee Price, a senior in Biomedical Sciences who is also minoring in Human Development and Family Science, said what started as a small project to benefit a few families has now grown into something huge. \u201CIt started as just a single box and now it\u2019s crazy and I don\u2019t even know how many boxes of food we have,\u201D Price said. \u201CWe came up with the idea and Dr. Purvis helped get the word out. I honestly never really knew food was a problem growing up because I was never in that realm of things so it\u2019s helped open my eyes that this is a real issue.\u201D Typically reserved for rehabilitation treatment and physical therapy, the floor of the BenchMark Physical Therapy location off East University Drive in Auburn turned into a makeshift food bank on May 23. Dozens of food donation boxes were carefully labeled and ready to be sent to families in need as part of the Summer Sustenance Project. Purvis highlighted that roughly 448 students in grades K-5 within Auburn City Schools can qualify for food assistance and when her students began asking the Auburn community and other university students to help with food donations for the project, they came through in a big way. \u201CAlmost all of the food was donated and the only thing we bought were the Chef Boyardee cases,\u201D Purvis said. \u201CThe donations were from the dorms, HDFS classes collected them and then donations within the College of Human Sciences.\u201D The partnership between Auburn University Human Development and Family Science and Auburn City Schools is helping children get through the summer months where food insecurity can be heightened due to the summer break. Emma Chumley, a sophomore in pre-nursing at Auburn University, also took Purvis\u2019 class and said after helping students over Thanksgiving, Christmas and spring break she asked if it could be done in the summer months as well. \u201CI approached Dr. Purvis and asked her if we could continue it into the summer and that\u2019s when we kick started it,\u201D Chumley said. \u201CI\u2019ve just enjoyed meeting the families and seeing how grateful they are because it really is making a difference. The kids are aware more than we think they are and they\u2019re very appreciative. I\u2019ve also loved seeing how much Auburn students have helped and I\u2019ve enjoyed seeing them taking it on. Even something small, they went out of their way to donate and try to help the community.\u201D Purvis, along with Price and Chumley, want to encourage Auburn residents and students to continue to give food donations throughout the summer. Food drop off areas include Spidle Hall, Bridgeway Diagnostics off East Samford Ave., and BenchMark Physical Therapy. Qualified families can collect food donations through the Summer Sustenance Project June 27 and July 25 at the BenchMark Physical Therapy location off East University Drive in Auburn. Purvis, who has been adamant about giving credit to her students for starting the project, said it\u2019s rewarding to see students apply the concepts they learn outside the classroom. \u201CAs an instructor I\u2019m like \u2018yes they finally listened to something I said\u2019 but it\u2019s them connecting the concepts that we\u2019re teaching in child development,\u201D Purvis said. \u201CThey\u2019re asking how do I solve this problem? Not, oh this problem exists and that\u2019s for someone else to solve. They actually want to help.\u201D For more information on the Summer Sustenance Project, visit facebook.com\/summersustenanceproject.
