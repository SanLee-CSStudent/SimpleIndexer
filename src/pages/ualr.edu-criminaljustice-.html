The University of Arkansas at Little Rock has been ranked as one of the top universities to earn an online master\u2019s degree in criminal justice. Research in the Rock Congratulations to Dr. Tusty ten Bensel and Dr. Robert (Bob) Lytle on their recent National Science Foundation (NSF) grant award. Through this grant, they will examine the context and incidence of anti-Muslim sentiment, ranging from prejudice to hate crimes, through a combination of interviews and surveys over the next three years. This study will specifically focus on the perceptions of Muslims in Arkansas who have been the target of discrimination, harassment, or interpersonal crime, along with the impacts such behaviors have on victims. In addition, this grant also includes funding for 30 undergraduate students to participate in the design, implementation, analysis and reporting of this project. Students who are interested in criminal justice and graduate education will be selected from a nationwide pool of applicants to work with various SCJC faculty members on this project over eight summer weeks. The Arkansas Department of Corrections awarded faculty at the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology a multi-year contract ($453,000) to examine prison culture and climate. This project is being led by Dr. Mary Parker who has worked with the Arkansas Department of Corrections for over 20+ years. Dr. Parker is joined by Drs. Robert Lytle and Molly Smith. To describe the study, Dr. Parker said that \u201Cwe are one of the few large-scale projects that include visitors and volunteers,\u201D Parker said. \u201CFamilies are a critical dynamic to incarceration and adding their perspective to the study gives us invaluable information on the impact of incarceration on friends and families of those incarcerated. Most people do not realize it but hundreds of volunteers work in prison providing religious programming, therapy groups, dog training, meditation, etc. for the inmate population. We will be surveying a sample of this population to gain their perspectives on what we can do better in our individual prison to improve multiple dynamics of the culture in prison.\u201D Read more about the research that our faculty and students are engaged in, along with their work in the community.
