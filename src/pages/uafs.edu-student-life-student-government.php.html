This is done through representation and decision-making on campus or in the local community. A few resolutions that made an impact on campus would be the building of the RAWC, closing of Kinkead Avenue, and painting the light poles blue. ALLOCATIONS Funding Your Organization Part of the duties of your representatives is to allocate funds to all of the registered student organizations on campus. The process starts with the RSO submitting a funding request to the finance and allocation committee, which is chaired by the SGA treasurer. The committee then votes on the amount and brings it forward to be voted on by the rest of the assembly. SERVICE Serving the Student Body An important portion of being a representative is service, which is done through programming. We host an array of events on campus that aim to help students and their day-to-day activities. From a kickball tournament to raise money for the Special Olympics to driving students to their classes, our members are always ready to help. 5210 Grand Avenue | P.O.
