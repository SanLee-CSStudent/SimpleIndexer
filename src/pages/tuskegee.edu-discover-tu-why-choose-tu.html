About Us About Us Tuskegee University is an independent and state-related institution of higher education. Its programs serve a student body that is coeducational as well as racially, ethnically and religiously diverse. With a strong orientation toward disciplines which highlight the relationship between education and work force preparation in the sciences, professions and technical areas, Tuskegee University also emphasizes the importance of the liberal arts as a foundation for successful careers in all areas. Accordingly, all academic majors stress the mastery of a required core of liberal arts courses. Tuskegee University is located in Tuskegee, Alabama, which is 40 miles east of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, Alabama, and 20 miles west of the city of Auburn, Alabama. It is also within easy driving distance to the cities of Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. The academic programs are organized into five colleges and three schools: (1) the College of Agriculture, Environment and Nutrition Sciences; (2) the College of Arts and Sciences; (3) the Andrew F. Brimmer College of Business and Information Science; (4) the College of Engineering; (5) the College of Veterinary Medicine; (6) the Robert R. Taylor School of Architecture and Construction Science; (7) the School of Education; and (8) the School of Nursing and Allied Health. The curricula for these colleges and schools currently offer over 50 degrees including 39 Bachelor's, 13 Master's, 2 Doctor's of Philosophy: one in Materials Science and Engineering, and one in Integrative BioSciences, and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. Graduate instruction leading to the Master's degree and Doctor of Philosophy Degree is offered in some of the colleges and schools. The University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC); and the following programs are accredited by national agencies: Architecture, Business, Education, Engineering, Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Social Work, and Veterinary Medicine. Of special note is the fact that Tuskegee University is the only independent, historically black university with four engineering programs that are nationally accredited by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET), the major accrediting body for the engineering sciences. Also, Tuskegee University's Chemistry program is one of only a few among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) that is approved by the American Chemical Society. Furthermore, the Dietetics Program is approved by the American Dietetic Association and the Food Science Program is approved by the Institute of Food Technologists. Tuskegee University was the first black college to be designated as a Registered National Historic Landmark (April 2, 1966), and the only black college to be designated a National Historic Site (October 26, 1974), a district administered by the National Park Service of the U. S. Department of Interior.

Over the past 135+ years since it was founded by Booker T. Washington in 1881, Tuskegee University has become one of our nation's most outstanding institutions of higher learning. While it focuses on helping to develop human resources primarily within the African American community, it is open to all. Tuskegee's mission has always been service to people, not education for its own sake. Stressing the need to educate the whole person, that is, the hand and the heart as well as the mind, Dr. Washington's school was soon acclaimed--first by Alabama and then by the nation for the soundness and vigor of its educational programs and principles. The solid strength has continued through the subsequent administration of Dr. Robert R. Moton (1915-1935), Dr. Frederick D. Patterson (1935-1953), Dr. Luther H. Foster (1953-1981) and Dr. Benjamin F. Payton (1981-2010). In August 2010, Dr. Charlotte P. Morris assumed the role of Interim President of the University. She is the first female to serve at the helm of Tuskegee University, and only the second Interim President for the institution. Dr. Gilbert L. Rochon served as the 6th president of Tuskegee University from November 1, 2010 to October 19, 2013. Dr. Matthew Jenkins served as Acting President from October 19, 2013 to June 14, 2014. Dr. Brian L. Johnson assumed the role of 7th President of Tuskegee University from June 15, 2014 until June 30, 2017. Dr. Charlotte P. Morris again served as Interim President of the institution from July 1, 2017 until June 30, 2018. Dr. Lily D. McNair became Tuskegee University\u2019s eighth president after being unanimously selected by its Board of Trustees. Beginning July 1, 2018, she became the first female president of the institution in its 136-year history. She served as president from July 1, 2018 until June 30, 2021. Afterwhich, Dr. Charlotte P. Morris again served as Interim President of the institution. The Tuskegee University Board of Trustees proudly made the announcement that interim President Dr. Charlotte P. Morris was elected the ninth president of Tuskegee University, effective August 1, 2021. Dr. Charlotte P. Morris is the second-ever female President of the University. Tuskegee enrolls approximately 3,000 students and employs approximately 800 faculty and support personnel.
