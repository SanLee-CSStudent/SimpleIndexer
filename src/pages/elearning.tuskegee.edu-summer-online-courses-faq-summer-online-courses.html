One of the benefits of taking online is flexibility. A few courses may require specific log-on times for certain activities or assignments, but most courses have assignments and due dates; when the student logs on to complete them is determined by the student. Some assignments and tests may only be available for a limited time (such as a 48-hour period), so they must be completed at some point within the designed time.
