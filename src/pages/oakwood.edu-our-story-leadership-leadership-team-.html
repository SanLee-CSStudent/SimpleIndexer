The President\u2019s Personal Statement \u201CMy vision for living is found in Micah 6:8\u2013 \u2018He hath showed thee, O man, what is good! And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\u2019 This calling centers me in my spiritual walk. I am a minister because God called me at the age of 16 to share his message as my life\u2019s vocation. I am a leader because the unique skill sets that God has gifted to me have carried me into positions of leadership across my career. I am an academic because I believe that education is on the same continuum as personal redemption, and I believe that expansion of the intellect is as great an act of stewardship as is the care of the body. I am a teacher-scholar because of my thirst for knowledge and my passion for engagement with other learners. I am an administrator because strategic visioning and tactical decision-making is a foundational ministry that advances the mission of the institutions in which I have served. Therefore, I am a steward who accepts the vocation of Christian service and leadership with deep humility and consecrated commitment. This perspective is reflected in my core values.\u201D Core Values \u201CIntegrity expresses my commitment to living as a unified person. Spirituality reflects my commitment to living a life of active fellowship with God. Humility embodies my commitment to prayerful dependence on God\u2019s grace. Equity represents my commitment to the just, fair, and respectful treatment of others. Compassion communicates my commitment to caring for the least favored among us. Excellence entails my commitment to striving for nothing less than the very best for self and for others. Collaboration supports my commitment to honoring colleagues by valuing their gifts, talents, and contributions to shared goals.\u201D Mission Statement \u201CMy mission is to serve my God, my family, my community, and humanity with every resource that God has given me. I will serve as many as I can,for as long as I can,until God calls me to my rest. This mission informs my sense of fiscal responsibility, my commitment to moral integrity, and my dedication to organizational effectiveness.\u201D Provost and Senior Vice President Colwick Mervyn Wilson, Ph.D. has served as the current Provost and Senior Vice President of Oakwood University in Huntsville, AL, USA since September 1, 2017.
