At the tender age of 25 years (1906), Tuskegee Institute could boast of a well-organized band of 35 pieces and an 18-piece orchestra. Organizationally, the band was part of the Military Department, an administrative arrangement of several years\u2019 duration. Captain Elbert V. Williams was bandmaster and Captain N. Emerson Perkins succeeded him. George B. Thornton served as acting bandmaster during 1914-15, on a part-time basis, after which Captain Frank L. Drye was appointed bandmaster of the 45-member Tuskegee Institute Band. In 1931, the School of Music was established under the directorship of William L. Dawson. The band became a component of the newly formed department. In the 1940s, it became the Department of Music, still headed by Dawson. Captain Drye held the title of Head of Band Instruments, and Director of Bands. The band, consisted of 75 pieces including drum majors, juvenile drum majors, majorettes and herald trumpeters. Subsequent directors of the Tuskegee Marching Band have been Dr. William P. Foster (Director of Bands Emeritus at Florida A&M University), Dr. Lucius R. Wyatt (former Director of Bands at Prairie View A&M University), Edward Graves (Director of Bands at Tennessee State University), Ronald J. Sarjeant (retired Director of Bands at South Carolina State University), and Warren L.

At the end of the Tour, the 10 bands that demonstrate the most showmanship, musicianship and fan interaction will be invited to the Invitational Showcase. Each of the 10 schools selected will receive an additional funds toward its scholarship fund. The invitees will include the two top bands from each of the four HBCU athletic conferences (CIAA, SWAC, MEAC, SIAC) and two independent schools. The selection process is based solely on a three-tiered process. Thirty-three percent of the vote will be from the on-line fan voting at http:\/\/www.HondaBattleoftheBands.com . Thirty-three percent will be from the commissioners of the four conferences and school presidents, and thirty-three percent will be from the band directors.
