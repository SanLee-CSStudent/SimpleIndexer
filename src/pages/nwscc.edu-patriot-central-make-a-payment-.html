The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is printed in the General Catalog. The intent of the Act is to define the types of information about students that may be released without their prior consent. An Authorization to Release or Withhold Information Form can be completed in the Admissions Office which serves as student consent for records to be released to a parent, legal guardian, other tuition providers, or other indicated individuals. This form may also be used to opt-out of directory information disclosure. Payment Deadline Please refer to the semester registration guide for tuition payment deadlines. After the payment deadline, schedules can be deleted for nonpayment of tuition and fees. Students may not attend class if tuition or fees are unpaid. A financial hold will be placed on the student\u2019s account when there is any past due financial obligation to the college. When there is a financial hold, the student will not be permitted to register for classes, receive transcripts, nor any other service from the college.
