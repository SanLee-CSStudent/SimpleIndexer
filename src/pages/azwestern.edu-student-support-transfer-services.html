Courses that are considered developmental courses are only transferred to meet requirements into the next level (i.e. below 100-level). All coursework completed with a letter grade \u201CC\u201D or higher within an 8 year time frame will be evaluated regardless of major currently pursuing at Arizona Western College.

Courses more than eight years old apply to degree requirements at the discretion of the College. In areas where information changes rapidly, departments may accept, reject, or request revalidation of earlier courses. There is no time limit for general education courses (AGEC). Quarter-Hour Credits: Students with quarterly hours will need to make up the difference of credits equated to Arizona Western College coursework. A deficiency in an AGEC category due to quarter-hour must be recovered by additional credits within the same or another AGEC categorical requirement. *Quarter hour = two-thirds (.67) semester hours.
