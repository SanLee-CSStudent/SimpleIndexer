We remain one of the best education bargains in America. Our graduates have gone on to achieve great things - they are professors, politicians, teachers, law officers, attorneys, doctors, nurses, and the list goes on. Many National Park alums head to four year schools where, on average, community college students are more successful than native students in terms of grade point average. If you're uncertain about your career, we can help you navigate. If you are certain, we can help you reach your destination faster. We are designed to help students grow and succeed, and we'd like the chance to show you that. Our community college is part of a greater partnership, one that involves community leaders, taxpayers, donors, trustees, legislators, alums, students, faculty and staff, and the support of the state of Arkansas.
