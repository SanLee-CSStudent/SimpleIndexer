UACCH-T is an accredited, open-access institution that connects students and community partners to quality education and supports a culture of academic, occupational, personal growth and enrichment programs throughout Southwest Arkansas. With the opening of UACCH-Texarkana Instructional facility in the Fall of 2012, UACCH-T is better prepared to be regional contributor to the educational needs of southwest Arkansas. Supported by a Hempstead County sales tax, UACCH-T offers over 46 degrees and certificates for students to select from. Points of Pride UACCH-T celebrated a 35 percent increase in enrollment from the fall of 2006 through the fall of 2012. This enrollment growth has been matched by increasing graduation rates, with the largest graduation to date being held in May of 2011 when 574 degrees and certificates were awarded, a 129 percent increase from 2007-08. UACCH-T recently completed the construction of an additional instructional facility in Texarkana. UACCH-Texarkana opened for classes in the fall of 2012, thus expanding the impact of the college into a populated area within its existing service area. The construction of Hempstead Hall, a 63,000 square-foot auditorium and convention center opened in the fall of 2012. This facility, located near the front entrance to the UACCH-T Campus along Highway 29 South, is a great addition to the community and the UACCH-T Campus.
