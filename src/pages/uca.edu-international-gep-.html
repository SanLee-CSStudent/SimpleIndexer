Only students enrolled in select partner universities are eligible for this program. GEP students from our worldwide partners create a global learning environment for students and faculty at UCA. The GEP focuses on providing an excellent opportunity for all visiting students to learn more about American culture and pursue education in their discipline while improving English skills. The goal of GEP is to assist visiting students to become more globally-minded and academically motivated. Visiting students gain a perspective about the American higher education system and contribute to the global learning environment at UCA. Below are helpful documents for GEP students and partner institutions. School officials can collect and email the copies of required documents before the application deadline. Please contact Jingjng Li (jli@uca.edu) if you need assistance. APPLICATION DEADLINES: Applications are complete once all required documentation is submitted.
