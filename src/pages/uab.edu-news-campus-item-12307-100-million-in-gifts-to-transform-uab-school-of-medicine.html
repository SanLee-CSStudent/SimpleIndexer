In grateful recognition of a transformational $95 million lead gift from longtime University of Alabama at Birmingham supporter Marnix E. Heersink, M.D., the UAB School of Medicine will now be named the UAB Marnix E. Heersink School of Medicine. The record gift is the single largest philanthropic commitment in university history and will name the UAB Marnix E. Heersink School of Medicine, as well as establish and name the Marnix E. Heersink Institute of Biomedical Innovation and the Mary Heersink Institute for Global Health. The gift will provide support with both endowed and outright funds for key initiatives of the School of Medicine. Heersink, a renowned eye surgeon, innovator and entrepreneur, desires this gift to inspire and catalyze additional philanthropic contributions that support high-impact recruitments, programs and research in the School of Medicine. UAB will enhance this philanthropic support with a generous contribution of $5 million from Triton Health Systems, bringing the total support for the school to $100 million. UAB Senior Vice President of Medicine and Dean of the School of Medicine Selwyn Vickers, M.D., FACS, says the Heersink gift and others it inspires will set the future course of the School of Medicine. \u201COn behalf of the School of Medicine and all the people we serve across Alabama, the nation and the world \u2014 now and in the years to come \u2014 I sincerely thank Dr. Heersink,\u201D Vickers said. \u201CThis act of tremendous generosity reflects his heart for service and the scale of our shared ambition for the UAB School of Medicine to be a global leader in biomedical discovery and innovation, medical training, and patient care. It is a powerful affirmation of the unlimited potential of our school and reinforces what we have always known: that UAB truly is a world-class institution.\u201D Dr. Marnix E. Heersink and wife, Mary HeersinkIn just five years, the UAB School of Medicine grew its National Institutes of Health research portfolio by $100 million, making it one of only eight schools in the country to do so. This growth catapulted the School of Medicine\u2019s NIH ranking from No. 31 in 2014 to No. 21 among all schools and the top 10 for public medical schools. In addition, 12 departments ranked among the top 20. Vickers says the generous pledge was a strategic decision made by Heersink to invest in a school of medicine with a rapidly rising trajectory and growing opportunities for transformative impact in scientific discovery, training and clinical care. In addition, this gift will support the school\u2019s strategic growth and help recruit and retain the brightest scientists and physicians in priority areas like precision medicine and pharmacogenomics, pulmonology, oncology, neurology, health disparities, immunology, and others through endowed chairs and professorships \u2014 subject to later approval of the proposed occupants by the University of Alabama System Board of Trustees. The pledge also intends to establish and name a new, first-of-its-kind biomedical institute and an associated endowed support fund \u2014 the Marnix E. Heersink Institute of Biomedical Innovation and the Marnix E. Heersink Institute for Biomedical Innovation Endowed Support Fund \u2014 as well as name the Marnix E. Heersink Institute for Biomedical Innovation Conference Center. The institute will focus on entrepreneurial health care innovation initiatives that foster and facilitate health care and socioeconomic transformation. The primary location of the institute will be at UAB, with a prominent physical presence in Dothan, Alabama, the Heersink family\u2019s hometown. Heersink says UAB\u2019s history of notable achievements and aggressive pursuit of excellence motivated him to partner with the school to advance their shared priorities. He attributes his affinity for the school to a set of qualities it embodies that he calls the three E\u2019s: excellence, expansive and encompassing. \u201CI have seen that, in all it does, the school strives for excellence, works to expand its reach, and values collaboration and encompassing diverse backgrounds, voices and talents,\u201D Heersink said. \u201CThis gift will build on the school\u2019s tremendous momentum and enhance its ability to innovate and deliver on the three E\u2019s (excellence, expansive, encompassing) in a very strategic way. I look forward to a continued partnership in supporting its life-changing work. Mary and I are so appreciative of the wonderful education UAB has given our family and now also look forward to UAB\u2019s increased presence in our hometown of Dothan.\u201D Naming the School of Medicine has been a priority of Vickers and UAB President Ray L. Watts, M.D.; they stress that a gift of this significance endorses and builds on the school\u2019s worldwide reputation in a very powerful and public way. \u201CHaving the Heersink name on the school is a powerful testament to its competitiveness among the very best academic medical centers in the world, which is indeed the result of our focus on the three E\u2019s: excellence, expansive and encompassing,\u201D Watts said. \u201CDr. Heersink\u2019s transformative support is critical to building on our global prominence and impact, and his humility and commitment to making the world a better place are inspiring. We will work diligently every day to honor his confidence and trust.\u201D Learn more about the UAB Marnix E. Heersink School of Medicine here.
