All college-sponsored, supported, or work-related out-of-state travel is cancelled until further notice. Also, all events scheduled at the college are cancelled during this time.

If you want to forward your office phone to another phone like a cell phone, home phone, or a phone at another location, use a Call Rule. https:\/\/192.168.250.40\/main (This is only accessible from on-campus) Using the Switchvox web-based client, login in with your extension and voice mail password and then click on Features and then Call Rules. Once in Call Rules, click on Create Call Rule Set in the upper left hand corner and name it Call Forwarding to xxx. It is most common to forward calls to your cell phone. Leave the Rule Set Time Frame and Rule Set Status with their default settings and then click on Save Call Rule Set. Next, click on the pencil icon under Actions for the new call rule. Then, click on Create Action in the upper left hand corner.

Just click on the Disable icon (the red circle with a line through it.) Important! Be sure to test to verify your new call rule is working as desired and make any changes as needed.
