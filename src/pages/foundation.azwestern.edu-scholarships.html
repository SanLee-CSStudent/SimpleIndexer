Does the amount that I receive in scholarships affect my eligibility for financial aid? No, scholarships funds are applied to your balance before any financial aid awards are disbursed. You are required to file your FAFSA (Federal Application for Federal Student Aid) as a component of your scholarship application but contact the AWC Financial Aid office if you have any questions. Q. If I receive a scholarship, will I receive a check in the mail or does the money go to the school? Scholarship awards are set up within the AWC Financial Aid award system to cover your tuition and fees (sometimes books or housing as dictated by scholarship criterion) before your Federal financial aid is applied. Unless your scholarship includes a cash disbursement, the funds will be returned to the AWC Foundation\/donor. You will be required to meet with the Financial Aid Scholarship Specialist to formally accept your scholarship before it will appear on your account. Q. When should I start applying for scholarships?
