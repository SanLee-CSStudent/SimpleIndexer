TUSCALOOSA, Ala. \u2014 A new exhibit at the Paul W. Bryant Museum honors the players and coaches of the first 25 years of softball at The University of Alabama. \u201CAlabama Softball \u2013 The First 25 Years\u201D opened May 6 and includes a mural with the names of every player and coach from 1997 to 2021. The exhibit highlights players who earned First Team All-American honors and includes trophies from the team\u2019s Southeastern Conference titles and Women\u2019s College World Series appearances. \u201CWe really wanted the exhibit to be more immersive than some of our previous exhibits,\u201D said Paul W. Bryant Museum Director Olivia Arnold. \u201CWe have a wall that symbolizes the Brickyard, complete with green carpeting to mimic the grass and crushed brick that mimics the warning track. To complete the exhibit, UA carpenters, who built the lockers at Rhoads Stadium, built reproduction lockers for us.\u201D The lockers will highlight five individual players at a time, with the players being rotated on a regular basis. The first five players being featured are Stephanie VanBrakle-Prothro, Charlotte Morgan, Jackie Traina, Bailey Hemphill and Montana Fouts. Lockers, just like those at Rhoads Stadium, are part of the new softball exhibit at the Bryant Museum. Arnold said the idea for the exhibit came about after a conversation she had with Alabama Head Softball Coach Patrick Murphy. \u201CThe museum\u2019s mission is telling the story of all sports here at The University of Alabama,\u201D Arnold said. \u201CWhen Coach Murphy and I spoke about the softball team having just completed their 25th season, it immediately struck me that celebrating the first quarter-century of softball was an excellent idea for our temporary exhibit space.\u201D The Paul W. Bryant Museum, located on The University of Alabama campus, is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Tickets must be purchased online or at the museum.
