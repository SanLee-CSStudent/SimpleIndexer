If you can\u2019t find a core element, skip it and move on to the next one on the list. Author: Last name, First name Title of source: Titles of books, movies, or other long works go in italics. Articles, short stories, and other short works go in quotation marks. Container: When your source is a part of a larger whole, the larger whole is a container that holds your source. For an article in a journal, the article is the source and the journal is the container. For a YouTube video, the clip or movie is the source and the website is the container. Some sources have more than one container. For these sources, add the information about the second container after the information about the first container. For an article that was published in a journal that was accessed from a database: The article is the source, the journal is the first container, and the database where it lives is the second container.
