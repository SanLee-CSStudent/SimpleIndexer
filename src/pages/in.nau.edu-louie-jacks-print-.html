The new student printing solution, known as Jacks Print, will be implemented over the course of the 2018-2019 school year. Starting on October 1st, 2018, printing is paid through JDE. The new pay-as-you-go system means you must have money to print. Billing is no longer managed through your LOUIE account. Beginning at the start of term 2018, students can print 100 pages of black and white printing each term for free! After that, the price per each black and white page will drop to just $.05 a page. Pricing Single black and white: $.05 Double-sided black and white: $.08 Single color: $.10 Double-sided color: $.20 Printing options Web Print allows you to upload and print files to any ITS printer from anywhere on campus.
