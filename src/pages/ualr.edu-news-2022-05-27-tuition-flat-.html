That decision is part of the university\u2019s on-going efforts to keep college affordable for students amid the uncertainty of the pandemic and continuing inflation costs. \u201CFor many families, the cost of education can be a barrier to entry,\u201D said Chancellor Christina Drale. \u201CImproving access, with a focus on affordability, remains a top institutional priority for UA Little Rock.\u201D The measure was approved during the Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas meeting held May 25-26 at the University of Arkansas Community College at Batesville. UA Little Rock is the only 4-year institution in the University of Arkansas System that did not raise course tuition and fees for the upcoming year. Residence hall rates will also remain the same. \u201CIn addition to keeping the sticker-price cost of tuition flat, UA Little Rock continues to lower the net price\u2014the price students actually pay to enroll\u2013by matching students with internal and external scholarships that consider the student\u2019s academic merit and financial need,\u201D said Cody Decker, vice chancellor of student affairs and chief data officer.\u201D UA Little Rock student Tyrin Edwards said it was a blessing to know that he didn\u2019t have to worry about paying increased tuition and fees next year. \u201CThe tuition\/fees flat rates have been more than helpful as far as making it easier for me to afford college as I do come from a single parent household, and I have to work to provide for myself as far as food, my bills, and the essential things,\u201D Edwards said. \u201CIt helps take off the stress of me having to potentially come out of pocket or take out more loans than I can afford to cover my educational costs.\u201D As an online non-traditional student, Michelle Keithley said UA Little Rock\u2019s affordable tuition is one of the main reasons she was able to go back to school to complete her bachelor\u2019s degree in professional and technical writing. \u201COne of the reasons I chose to attend UA Little Rock is the affordable tuition,\u201D Keithly said. \u201CAfter being out of school for many years, I knew I wanted to complete a degree, and the online opportunity just made sense for me. UA Little Rock was a better fit for me primarily due to the cost. There are no surprises when I enroll in classes. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about between homework and paying everyday living expenses. I\u2019ve been extremely happy with my experience at Little Rock.\u201D UA Little Rock students can request additional support through the Care Team to talk with university employees about budgeting, minimizing expenses, and utilizing services such as the Trojan Food Pantry and other community agencies. Students can request support online, and a member of the Care Team will reach out to schedule a meeting. Share this Post: ?
