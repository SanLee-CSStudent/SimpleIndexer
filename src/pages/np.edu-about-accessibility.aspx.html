We actively work to increase the accessibility and usability of our digital presence by striving to meet the following principles: perceivable, operable, understandable and robust (POUR). The \u201CPerceivable\u201D principle is achieved when content can be identified no matter the assistive technology in use. The \u201COperable\u201D principle is achieved when visitors can successfully navigate and interact with content using controls, buttons and other items by creating an interface that can be controlled no matter the assistive technology in use. The \u201CUnderstandable\u201D principle is achieved when there is consistency in presentation and format, predictability in design usage patterns, and appropriate to the audience. The \u201CRobust\u201D principle is achieved when digital content is designed to function with assistive technology. NPC strives for compliance with all state and federal accessibility standards detailed in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 508 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Arkansas Technology Access for the Blind Law Act (Act 1227 of 1999). Act 1227 required the Arkansas Department of Information Systems to develop Non-visual Standards for Arkansas that ensures the needs of Arkansans who are blind or visually impaired are met through reasonable accommodation in the information technology products and services of the state. Information technology products and services include data, voice, and video technologies, as well as information dissemination methods such as the internet. This ensures that Arkansas government or state funded entities must have websites that are equally accessible to blind or visually impaired visitors. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards influence our web design. This site has been built using code that is compliant with the W3C standards for HTML and CSS, which allows for future technologies, including assistive technologies, to properly interact with and display web content. Our websites aspire to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA and meet or exceed Section 508 standards of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. At NPC, we believe that information and the access to that information is a basic human right that should not be denied to anyone. For this reason, NPC makes every effort to ensure the best possible digital experience. We recognize that there may be areas that need further attention and ask that if you experience an issue, please report it immediately and allow us the opportunity to correct the issue.
