Weather Related Emergency Policy Lyon College Weather Related Emergency Policy Cancellation of classes, delay of opening of school, or closure of College offices. The Weather-Related Emergency Policy will be put into effect in the event that any weather-related emergency or other external circumstance \u2013 for example, a major winter storm, flood, or prolonged area power outage necessitates the cancellation of classes, a delay in the opening of school, or the closure of College offices. Experience suggests that these circumstances occur very rarely. Any decision to cancel classes, delay the opening of school, or close College offices in the wake of a weather-related emergency will be taken by the Vice President for Student Life. The Vice President for Student Life, in consultation with the Director of Campus Safety and\/or the Director of Physical Plant, will be responsible for assembling any information on external or internal circumstances \u2013 for example, the condition of area roads \u2013 that are necessary to make an informed decision. Whenever possible, decisions necessitated by inclement weather will be made as early as possible, generally no later than 6:30 a.m. the day of the concern. This decision will be communicated to the following broadcast outlets through the use of the College\u2019s emergency notification system: Television KAIT-TV, Jonesboro (Channel 2 on Batesville Cable) KTHV-TV, Little Rock (Channel 11 on Batesville Cable) KATV-TV, Little Rock (Channel 7 on Batesville Cable) KARK-TV, Little Rock (Channel 4 on Batesville Cable) Local Cable Channel 6 (Suddenlink) AM Radio KAAB-AM, Batesville (1130 AM) KBTA- AM, Batesville (1340 AM) FM Radio KBTA\/SKY- FM, Batesville (99.5 FM) KFFB-FM, Fairfield Bay (106.1 FM) KIYS-FM, Jonesboro (101.9 FM) KWOZ-FM, Batesville (103.3 FM) KZLE-FM, Batesville (93.1 FM) Employees and students are requested to tune in to these broadcast outlets for information about the possible cancellation of classes or closure of school. Please do not call the College switchboard with inquires about school closings. Also, in the event of a weather related emergency, College officials will notify the College community of the cancellation of classes, delay of opening of school, or closure of College offices through the use of the College\u2019s emergency notification system. Students, faculty, staff, and other concerned parties will receive an e-mail message and\/or a text message on their cellular phone notifying them of the situation. In the event that the College remains open but adverse weather conditions seriously disrupt area roads: Non-residential students who feel that they cannot get to school safely should inform the Student Life Office (307-7314) or the Provost\u2019s office (307-7202). Employees who feel that they cannot get to work safely should inform their supervisors or department heads. Under Lyon\u2019s personnel policies, any employee who does not get to work because of adverse weather conditions must take the day or hours as personal or vacation time.
