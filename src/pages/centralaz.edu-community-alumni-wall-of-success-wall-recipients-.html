The first honorees were inducted during the 40th Anniversary Celebration of the Signal Peak Campus on November 14, 2009. The success of colleges and universities often is measured in numbers \u2013number of graduates, number of degrees, number of grants received, number of programs offered. We believe the success of colleges and universities is measured in people, and specifically in the students that comprise the classes that graduate from Central Arizona College. For more than 40 years, Central Arizona College has produced thousands of graduates who have received degrees, certificates and a jumpstart toward their goals \u2013whether it be entering the workforce or moving toward a four-year degree. Central Arizona College students are here with us for really what amounts to a moment, yet they carry the message of Central Arizona College throughout their lifetime. Our alumni and our current students are our most ardent supporters and our number one ambassadors. We created the Wall of Success tradition to honor our alumni and recognize their outstanding achievements \u2013and to thank them for allowing Central Arizona College the opportunity to impact their lives. The success of Central Arizona College is reflected in the accomplishments of the many individuals featured upon this Wall. Today we commemorate the establishment of the Wall of Success and celebrate this occasion with our alumni and friends. In 2019, the Alumni Achievement Award was renamed the Outstanding Alumni Award. This award continues the tradition to annually celebrate the personal and professional accomplishments, recognition and volunteerism of Central Arizona College alumni.
