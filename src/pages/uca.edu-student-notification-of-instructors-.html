Please realize that our notification does not excuse you from class. Each instructor establishes his or her own attendance policies, which are normally outlined in the instructor\u2019s syllabus. If you do miss class, you will need to contact the instructor to learn about missed assignments. Emergency Notification If a parent or immediate family member has a family emergency and needs to contact a student, our office can assist by notifying the student through a class instructor.
