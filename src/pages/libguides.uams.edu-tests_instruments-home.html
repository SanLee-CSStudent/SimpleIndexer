Let us know what you find useful or needs improvement: Feedback Form Overview Many journal literature databases provide access to tests, instruments, and reviews. Tests and instruments fall into two general categories: Non-commercial \u2013 Usually the easiest to locate and many can be searched in the journal literature, in books, or in an online web search. You will often find reviews of tests as well. If you find the full-text of a non-commercial test it is sometimes necessary to ask permission from the author(s) to administer them. Commercial \u2013 Usually available through a publisher for a fee. Be aware of copyright restrictions. Commercially distributed tests and instruments are typically not readily available through searching the journal literature or online resources. You can usually find critiques or reviews of published tests in reference sources, but access to the full instrument is limited unless otherwise indicated. For more information about commercial and non-commercial tests, see the American Psychological Association\u2019s FAQ\/Finding Information about Psychological Tests.
