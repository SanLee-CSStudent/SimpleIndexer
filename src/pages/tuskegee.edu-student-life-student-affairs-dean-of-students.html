DEAN OF STUDENTS SGA JUDICIAL AFFAIRS ADVISOR Ms. Tameka A. Harper, MPA tharper@Tuskegee.edu (334) 727-8421 Mr. Raynald Brown 2022 SPRING OPERATIONS As the university responds to Coronavirus (COVID - 19) to promote the safety of our community, the Office of the Dean of Students and Student Conduct will be working remotely primarily. Our commitment to serving our students and the greater university community continues. We will update this FAQ as our circumstances change.

IS THE OFFICE OPEN? Staff members are available as usual during normal business hours (8:00am - 4:30pm). It is advisable to contact the office in advance of your visit by phone or email.

Someone from the University will reach out to you to develop a plan to complete your sanctions if necessary. If you can, continue to work diligently to complete your sanctions on time. To reiterate, all administrative hearings and deadlines for sanctions will still take place at the scheduled dates and times. If you have any questions, please feel free to call us. Our main phone number is (334) 727-8421. I CALLED THE MAIN TELEPHONE NUMBER (334) 727-8421\/8420\/8422, BUT NO ONE ANSWERED. WHAT SHOULD I DO? The best way to contact our office is via email, either tharper@tuskegee.edu. While we are monitoring the main phone number, staff may not be able to answer when you call. We\u2019ve found that students are often hesitant to leave a voicemail and instead prefer to call back frequently until a staff member is able to answer the phone. A better strategy is leaving a voicemail message with the following information: (1) Your full name; (2) Your student ID number; (3) A callback number; and (4) The reason for your call GIVE The Office of the Dean of Students and Student Conduct is committed to student learning and the development of the whole student. We facilitate transformation and enrich education through new opportunities for learning and development; fostering an environment for the success of all community members; developing a deeper understanding of ourselves and others on an inclusive campus; enabling students to practice positive physical, emotional, social, and intellectual behaviors and relationships; preparing students to succeed during and after their university experience; resolving complex issues through advocacy, services, and compliance; and providing programs and facilities for the social, psychological, and academic needs of the campus community. To do all this, and much more, The Office of the Dean of Students and Student Conduct needs your support\u2014every gift matters. President's Essay Contest and Awards Tuskegee University has made a substantial commitment to make the cost of attending the University more affordable through its institutional scholarship and awards programs. Awards are usually based on financial need and scholarships are generally based on merit, talent or other criteria. The President\u2019s Essay Contest and the awarding of annual prizes has occurred since its inception in 1895 and was an essay contest that was sponsored by the Trinity Church of Boston Massachusetts. The original prize was $25.00 and an additional $15.00 was added a few years later for a second prize. These prizes were awarded to the students who wrote and delivered the best papers on the given subjects assigned for the competition. The program was very successful in the early years and was originally limited to juniors and seniors. However, it was eventually opened to all students and became known as the President\u2019s Essay Contest after the President of the Institute took on the sponsorship. In the early years there were a few other prizes that were established by the friends and benefactors of Tuskegee Institute for students excelling in some aspect of the educational experience at our University. Today the event awards over 100 scholarships with the help of Donors like you! To contribute to these awards please contact the Office of Advancement & Development and download, complete and mail your tax-deductible contribution to the Tuskegee University Office of Advancement and Development. Tiger's Den Food Pantry Food insecurity is when a person lacks access to nutritious, affordable food. As report by researchers in higher education about one-third of college students experience food insecurity. In response to those findings university officials, including Ms. Tameka Harper, MPA, Dean of Students, Department of Social Work and Ms. Kiyana Porter, Junior Political Science student began the establishment of the Tiger\u2019s Den the food pantry. Ms. Porter was one of the main students advocating for the food pantry\u2019s creation. After advocating for the pantry for more than a year and a half, Porter is now the student manager of the pantry, who is responsible for training volunteers and assisting with the daily operations. She will remain on a subcommittee, along with three university faculty members and administrators to maintain the pantry. Students can visit the pantry once per week by showing their Tuskegee University student ID cards. Students will not be questioned about their food security when they enter the food pantry. The pantry will start by giving out canned and non-perishable food items like cereal, juice, pasta and canned fruits and vegetables.
