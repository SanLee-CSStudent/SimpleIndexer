We are proud to partner with you to ensure your student\u2019s success. We want you and your student to have all the information available on a variety of different topics so they are ready to start (and continue) their college career strong. For this reason, we have created an online Family and Guest Orientation website filled with videos and interviews with many different offices and people around campus. While these videos were made intentionally for families of new students who could not come to campus for their orientation, families of returning students may find some new and useful information within these videos as well. Please visit the Family and Guest Orientation to see all the information we put together for you! Like us on Facebook for frequent updates so you can stay knowledgeable.
