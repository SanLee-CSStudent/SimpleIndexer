Asa Hutchinson presented NAC workforce representatives with a certificate of grant award for the truck driving and manufacturing programs. Shown from left are John Levy, automation instructor, Nell Bonds, dean of technical and outreach programs, Governor Asa Hutchinson and Scott Howie, technical programs director. Governor Asa Hutchinson recently awarded $8 million in workforce development grants to enhance the skills and number of skilled workers across the state, including $226,000 for North Arkansas College (NAC) to boost its CDL truck driving and manufacturing programs. The funding comes from the Office of Skills Development (OSD), a division of the Arkansas Department of Commerce. The grant was competitive, with 15 proposals received from colleges, universities, nonprofits and public entities. Recipients submitted their proposals to OSD in January and those chosen presented to the Career Education and Workforce Development Board (CEWD) in a \u201Cshark tank\u201D style in February. Selections were based on their specific training program, industry sector of focus and regional needs. Robotics, cyber security, forestry, and truck driver training are some of the workforce initiatives selected to receive grant funds. NAC president Rick Massengale, Sr., said the college is prepared to launch new classes for both career paths. \u201CThis grant award enables us to upskill individuals currently working in manufacturing sectors by the creation of an open educational manufacturing lab onsite with flexible hours conducive to industry needs and expands the class capacities of the truck driving program to answer the intense demand for drivers being felt across the nation. Individuals will have more access to certifications and credentials that will increase productivity to benefit employers and higher wages to support their families. We\u2019re excited to get started on this project.\u201D Grant recipients include: The University of Arkansas at Little Rock, $1.91 million to develop a regional cyber-learning center in partnership with the Arkansas Center for Data Sciences and other U of A System schools.
