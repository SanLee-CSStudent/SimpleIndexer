Instagram is a social media platform that allows users to share moments with their friends. Instagram is one of the most popular forms of social media for college students. What are Insta-Takeovers? You takeover Career Services\u2019 official Instagram account! Thus, an Insta\u2013Takeover! Expand your company\u2019s brand recognition to better recruit students to your organization by highlighting why students would be a good fit and what makes your organization stand out from the rest. Students see what they can expect from your organization, by providing a glimpse into a day in the life through conducting an \u201CInsta-Takeover.\u201D UCA students follow our Instagram account (@UCACareer) and will be able to see real time behind-the-scene peeks into your organization. We will publish each takeover to our YouTube channel, which will allow all students to see the benefits of your organization even after the Instagram Takeover is over. Companies and organizations can apply to do more than one takeover provided they highlight different offices, locations, or departments. Takeovers usually happen in the months of February and October before our Career Fairs.
