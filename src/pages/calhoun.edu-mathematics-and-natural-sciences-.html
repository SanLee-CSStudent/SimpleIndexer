The office hours are Monday \u2013 Thursday, 7:45 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. and Fridays, 7:45 a.m. \u2013 11:45 a.m. One responsibility of the dean\u2019s office is to schedule and staff the math and science classes offered by the college at both the Decatur and Huntsville campuses. I encourage you to stop by or call the office if you have any problems enrolling in classes, need assistance in resolving problems with an instructor, or you have a special request of some other nature. We are committed to providing you the best experience possible at Calhoun. Also, note the links to our Learning Centers on both campuses. The staff in these centers can help in a variety of ways as you do homework or lab assignments or prepare for a test \u2013 try them first before you pay for a tutor. The centers also make a great place for you and your study partners to meet.
