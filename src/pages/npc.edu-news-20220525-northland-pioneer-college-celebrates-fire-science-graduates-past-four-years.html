Northland Pioneer College (NPC) celebrated fire science graduates in the first ceremony of its kind post COVID, at the Performing Arts Center in Snowflake, AZ, on Wednesday, May 18, 2022. Having not had the opportunity for in-person celebrations during COVID, graduates from NPC classes dating back to 2019 were recognized for their achievements. On hand to offer support and encourage the next generation of firefighters were family, friends, colleagues, instructors, Northeast Arizona Training Center (NATC), and staff. Also included were members of the region\u2019s fire and police departments, the United States Forest Service, APS, the Salt River Project, and NPC college administration and staff. Guest speaker for the evening, Chief Bryan Savage of the Timber Mesa Fire and Medical District, addressed the graduates saying, \u201CYou have all chosen to embark on a career that will be both challenging and rewarding for as long as you choose to pursue it. The fire service has a rich history, but you people here today are its future. You have just completed the rigorous process of becoming a firefighter. You have studied hard; you have pursued your dreams, you have worked until you are exhausted, and you\u2019ve been successful. For your efforts, you have earned our respect, our congratulations, and our welcome as our newest members of the fire service family.\u201D But, he continued, \u201CIf you think you\u2019ve made it, you are wrong.\u201D Savage explained that your job from this point forward is to learn more and work harder. \u201CBe wary of the firefighter or officer who claims to have figured it all out. He or she has demonstrated in their words that they have stopped learning and stopped trying to improve. Do not become like this firefighter,\u201D Savage said. \u201CLives depend on the fact that we always find a better way to do our job,\u201D he said. \u201CYour job from this point forward is to be the best firefighter and public servant you can be. As you move toward the future, do not forget this academy experience. We have found that we all succeed when we succeed together. We have found that none of us is as strong and as capable as all of us and that no organization can stand alone when a big event comes our way.\u201D Savage, who has announced he will be retiring at some point soon, closed by saying, \u201CI thank you for your willingness to serve your community, I welcome you to the family, and I congratulate you all on your current and future successes. Thank you. Good luck, and may God bless you and your family.\u201D NATC is the base for the Northeastern Arizona Law Enforcement Training Academy (NALETA). The NPC Fire Science Academy Center features include a 10-acre defensive driving course, shooting range, 6-story burn tower, flash chamber, roof ventilation simulator, and numerous props for confined space training. Northland Pioneer College owns and operates the NATC facility with assistance from the Northeast Arizona Fire Chiefs Association, Northeast Arizona Police Association, Town of Taylor, Navajo County, U.S. Forest Service, and Arizona Public Service.
