Bright young people looking to make a difference do not necessarily think of accounting first. But that is exactly what has happened during the past several years in the Collat School of Business, where instructor Eddie Nabors teaches a course called Taxation and the Working Poor, which also is an Honors College seminar course called Poverty and Human Capability. \u201CWe started the class in 2017 with a dozen students in the Honors College and another dozen or so in the business school,\u201D Nabors said. \u201CFast forward to spring 2021 and we had 86 students, including 20-something students from our online accounting program all over the country.\u201D Students sign up for Nabors\u2019s class to learn about the challenges facing the working poor. Nabors explains the unexpected consequences of the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, \u201Cwhich has taken most of the cash out of the system,\u201D he said. \u201CYou get allowances for housing and food, but you don\u2019t have cash for a car to get to work or to pay the electric bill.\u201D Nabors reveals the tricks that buy-here-pay-here car lots use to re-sell the same vehicles to multiple credit-strapped buyers each year. \u201CWe talk about the causes, about the cycle of generational poverty and mass incarceration and the barriers in our \u2018land of opportunity,\u2019\u201D Nabors said. \u201CIf you break family income into quintiles, people who are born into the bottom 20% only have a 40% chance of moving up to the next quintile in their lifetime, and only a 7% chance of making it into the top 20%.\u201D But Nabors\u2019s students also come because they have heard that he will show them how to make a difference in people\u2019s lives through paperwork. Specifically, taxes. And though COVID changed the routine \u2014 as it has changed every routine \u2014 Nabors and his students found a way to make it happen regardless. \u2018Largest check they will get all year\u2019 \u201CThis is a service-learning course, and our service is volunteering with a community partner called Impact America to help working families who qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit fill out their tax returns,\u201D Nabors said. The EITC, first enacted in 1975 during the administration of Gerald Ford, \u201Chas been around ever since and it has been increased in every presidency, Democrat or Republican,\u201D he explained. \u201CIt is the largest anti-poverty program in the country. It provides income to a lot of working poor families to lift them above the poverty level.\u201D \u201CSitting beside a taxpayer and doing their return gives our students the opportunity to see how hard they work,\u201D he said. \u201CThey come in with multiple W2s \u2014 30 hours at Walmart, 20 hours somewhere else. Students learn that the working poor are not poor because they are lazy.\u201D \u2014 Eddie Nabors, instructor in the Department of Accounting and Finance at the Collat School of Business Sitting down with taxpayers to collect all the information needed to complete a tax return is an eye-opening experience, Nabors said. It is also the perfect living example of all the issues that Nabors talks about in class. \u201CSitting beside a taxpayer and doing their return gives our students the opportunity to see how hard they work,\u201D he said. \u201CThey come in with multiple W2s \u2014 30 hours at Walmart, 20 hours somewhere else. Students learn that the working poor are not poor because they are lazy.\u201D \u201CWhen I saw this class offered it really was something that I was drawn to as a way to help people in a tangible way and to start having an impact around Birmingham,\u201D said Caedmon Isaacson, an Honors College student from Atlanta. \u201CIt\u2019s really sad to hear some of the stories and situations that people end up in \u2014 many due to the pandemic. I had people who worked four or five jobs in the past year or who got laid off and had to use all of their savings just to feed themselves and their kids. When you talk to these people, it really makes getting them a return worthwhile.\u201D The sums are not insubstantial. \u201CWe have some checks as large as $10,000 and a $5,000 check is not unusual,\u201D Nabors said. \u201CFor most of the families we work with, this is the largest check they will get all year. They can pay bills or get car repairs or get dental work done or any one of the other things that they have been putting off. They get their W2s and they don\u2019t sit around waiting \u2014 they come running to get their tax returns done.\u201D Trust and taxes Accounting majors make up a healthy percentage of Nabors\u2019s classes. \u201CBut we\u2019ve had biomedical science majors, chemistry majors, psychology majors \u2014 and nobody has a problem doing the tax work,\u201D he said. \u201CThey come in scared to death that they will make a mistake, but they take eight hours of training and pass a certification exam before they start. We\u2019ve never had anyone who couldn\u2019t do it.\u201D The tax details are one concern, but many students also start out nervous about their interactions with taxpayers. A pre-med student who took Nabors\u2019s class told him, \u201CTo sit down with someone you have never met and ask them for all kinds of personal information, you have to be able to gain their confidence.\u201D \u201CShe was scared to death to go out and do it at first,\u201D Nabors said, \u201Cbut later she told me, \u2018This gave me confidence. I know I can do it now.\u2019\u201D From libraries to Zoom, but still impactful Students usually meet families at one of several Impact America sites in public libraries in Woodlawn, West End, Bessemer and other community locations. After hours of training and a certification exam, \u201Cthe students sit side-by-side with the taxpayer to prepare their return and then that gets checked twice,\u201D Nabors said. \u201CIt can be nerve-wracking the first few times, sitting with strangers and asking them personal questions and all.\u201D COVID destroyed the opportunity in mid-season in 2020, but in 2021 \u201Cwe were able to do it virtually,\u201D he said. Students connected with taxpayers by phone and completed their returns using preparation software called Get Your Refund while on a live Zoom call with an Impact America staff member. \u201CIt wasn\u2019t quite the same connection, but they were still being supervised and interacting with the taxpayers,\u201D Nabors said. \u201CAnd the returns were still being reviewed. It was a positive experience.\u201D \u201CWhen I saw this class offered it really was something that I was drawn to as a way to help people in a tangible way and to start having an impact around Birmingham. It\u2019s really sad to hear some of the stories and situations that people end up in \u2014 many due to the pandemic. When you talk to these people, it really makes getting them a return worthwhile.\u201D \u2014 Caedmon Isaacson, an Honors College student from Atlanta Pre-pandemic, Nabors had already decided to include online accounting students in his course, including tax preparation. He was originally going to have them identify a local volunteering site in their city, \u201Cbut when COVID hit and Impact America had the option for everyone to work virtually, we included the online students with everyone else,\u201D Nabors said. \u201CWe had people in Iowa and all over the country doing tax returns for people in Birmingham. They did a good job and had fun as well.\u201D \u201CA person\u2019s finances can tell you a lot about their story,\u201D said Anna Liles, a student in UAB\u2019s fully online undergraduate accounting program from Guntersville, Alabama. \u201CWhen you know where a person works, how many jobs they have held in the last year, how many children they are supporting and, finally, how much money they have made, you begin to empathize with them. I was very grateful to be able to help these individuals file their tax returns and help them get the most that was available to them.\u201D The experience \u201Cwas a real eye-opener,\u201D added one accounting student from Trussville. \u201CI learned that I enjoyed doing taxes and discovered a personal side to preparing taxes as well. Even when everything is online, you still build a pseudo-relationship with the family that you are doing taxes for. You learn some very personal information\u2026 you root for them in many ways and want what is best for them from my experience.\u201D Individuals interested in volunteering with Impact America to help with tax preparation can contact Caroline Janeway at cjaneway@impactamerica.com. Protection from \u2018predatory businesses\u2019 Most people have heard of payday loan companies and title loan companies. \u201CThere are also predatory tax preparers,\u201D Nabors said. \u201CIf people don\u2019t come to us, they go to a place that opens Jan. 1 and closes April 15 and may charge $400 or more to get a return done that is usually not accurate and is often fraudulent. They will rent a storefront in a neighborhood and put up signs that say, \u2018Two kids, $5,600 refund.\u2019 They promise and they are not shy about delivering, even if it is false information. It makes me sick to think about it.\u201D \u201CA person\u2019s finances can tell you a lot about their story. When you know where a person works, how many jobs they have held in the last year, how many children they are supporting and, finally, how much money they have made, you begin to empathize with them.\u201D \u2014 Anna Liles, a student in UAB\u2019s fully online undergraduate accounting program from Guntersville, Alabama \u201COur primary role is to give taxpayers an alternative to the exorbitant fees that they encounter at commercial tax preparers,\u201D said Jennifer Hughes, program manager with Impact America. \u201CGenerally, across the country the average fee that an individual might pay is $400. At $400 per return, Eddie\u2019s students helped taxpayers save $530,000 in fees and secure $2.68 million in refunds.\u201D These funds \u201Care not just a benefit for the individuals and families, but for their communities and the local economy as well,\u201D Hughes said. \u201CAnd we wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without great partners like Eddie and his students. Eddie is among our most reliable and enthusiastic supporters, and we couldn\u2019t do what we do in Birmingham without him and his students.\u201D As part of the course, students are required to complete 30 hours of volunteer work. \u201CWe had one student who volunteered for 57 hours,\u201D Nabors said. \u201CIn his final reflection paper at the end of the class, he wrote, \u2018I love these people. Working with the taxpayers has been so meaningful.\u2019 It brings tears to my eyes to see that kind of impact.\u201D At the end of class, \u201CI\u2019ll tell my students, \u2018Ok guys, what are you going to do about it?\u2019\u201D Nabors said. Nabors\u2019s students volunteered more than 1,850 hours working with taxpayers in spring 2021. They helped to prepare 1,325 tax returns, saving taxpayers $530,000 in fees and securing $2.68 million in tax refunds. \u201CI know Professor Nabors wanted all of us to walk away with a better understanding of what it means to be the working poor and also how we can help alleviate their burden,\u201D Liles said. \u201CVolunteering to file tax returns was a great way to start. And I\u2019ve begun to pay more attention to the small ways I can help in my own community. Just last week I purchased a school supplies kit through our local school to go to a child in need. Hopefully that will boost a child\u2019s confidence and alleviate the financial burden of their parent.\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s a really fulfilling class from my side,\u201D Nabors said. \u201CI am so blessed that my departmental administration and school administration support this. I could be teaching normal financial accounting classes, which is what I was hired to do, but the dean\u2019s office and my department chair allowed me to take two of these classes and do something a little different. \u201CWe are able to help people who really need help and enlighten students so they may think differently down the road. I\u2019ll tell them, \u2018Say you are an HR manager and have an employee who is arriving late. Do you fire them or talk to them and find out if they don\u2019t have reliable transportation?\u2019 Hopefully people will be more empathetic in the future.\u201D Enhancing student development as engaged learners, researchers and citizens by fostering community-based opportunities is a strategic objective of Forging the Future, UAB\u2019s strategic plan. Eddie Nabors\u2019s course is a notable example of that objective in action.
