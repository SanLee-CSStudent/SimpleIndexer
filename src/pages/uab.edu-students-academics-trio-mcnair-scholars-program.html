The MCAT preparation that was built into the program helped me learn how to study for the test, which I believe is a key reason that I was able to increase my score following my first practice test. I also gained a lot of knowledge from the professional workshops on topics such as financial planning and etiquette. I previously did not see the importance in these things, so I am grateful that this program helped me better myself in that way.\" Joshua Rodgers, McNair Alumni - Spring 2021 \"Because of McNair, I was able to work funded positions over the summer, as well as qualify for paid research positions over my undergraduate career.
