The goal of The Shakespeare Project is to introduce area high school students to Shakespeare's works free of charge. We believe that the plays are of central importance to the education of young minds and have an edifying effect when presented in a dynamic, modern way. Also, area high school English teachers often find themselves having to teach or stage Shakespeare without having had any specific training in the subject. We offer our area high school teachers specialized training by renowned professionals. This too is free of charge. Once a year, then, The Shakespeare Project aims to put on eight consecutive performances, with professional actors and crew. Visit the Shakespeare Project Website. With five departments, the College provides general studies in more than eight majors and a wide variety of minors in the arts and humanities. The College is the intellectual center of Jacksonville State University, helping all students build the foundation for their future studies. To enable students to achieve their greatest potential, the College emphasizes excellence in teaching in every department, with dynamic and caring faculty whose fine work in the classroom is bolstered by research, scholarship, artistic creation, and service activities. Through the work of its faculty and students, the College of Arts and Humanities enhances the cultural, intellectual, and social life of Jacksonville State University, the local community, and Northeast Alabama.
