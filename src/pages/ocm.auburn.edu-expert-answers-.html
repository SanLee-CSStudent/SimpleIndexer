New SARS-CoV-2 variant a wake-up call for US, other industrialized nations A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated and characterized from South Africa on Nov. 9. This \u201Cvariant of concern\u201D is designated Omicron by the World Health Organization for the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet. The virus has a \u201Cconstellation\u201D of mutations more than 50 total, of which 32 are in the all-important spike protein, which may cause the virus to be more transmissible, produce more severe disease and override existing immunity. The reason for this concern is that prior variants have had only a few mutations in the spike protein. Scientists indicate that there is much work that needs to be done examining this variant in terms of transmissibility, severity of illness and, most importantly, whether protection stimulated by multiple doses of currently approved vaccines will provide significant protection against infection or clinical signs. Initial data from areas with a high number of positive cases indicate that the Omicron variant is more infectious than the Delta virus. However, more data needs to be collected on the incidence and severity of disease produced by this new variant in areas with a high frequency of positive cases. Auburn physics professor discusses new revolutionary telescope, recent space-related news Space-related storylines have proliferated the news in recent weeks, from reports of space debris forcing astronauts at the International Space Station, or ISS, to take shelter or maneuver the station out of harm\u2019s way, to satellite launches aimed at meteors. In addition, NASA will launch a revolutionary telescope on Dec. 18 that will give scientists expanded capabilities for novel research projects designed to study the formation of planets. Auburn University Associate Professor of Physics Dennis Bodewits discussed the recent news and what the future may hold for space research. What to know about the omicron variant With the appearance of the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there are a number of questions regarding what the disease is, how it is transmitted, who is vulnerable and how it is treated. Marilyn Bulloch, associate clinical professor in the Harrison School of Pharmacy\u2019s Department of Pharmacy Practice, provides comments on what is known about the newest variant.

Supply chain expert explains consumer issues ahead of holidays and shopping season Businesses survive and thrive on supply and demand. They rely on the supply chain to get products from production to consumers, but when a global pandemic disrupts that chain of events, consumers are left without and demanding more. Product shortages likely will worsen into this holiday season as supplies dwindle and demand increases. In the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, paper products like toilet paper and paper towels were available in limited quantities or not at all. Eighteen months later, consumers are finding stores lacking in such products as half-and-half, yogurt and meat. And now experts say toys will be scarce for even Santa Claus to produce this holiday season. Auburn researcher, curator of birds refutes claim that ivory-billed woodpeckers are now extinct The Associated Press recently reported that the U.S. government declared 23 species extinct, including the ivory-billed woodpecker that once frequently inhabited the Southeast. But according to Auburn University biological sciences professor and researcher Geoffrey Hill, the bird\u2019s inclusion on the list was premature. Hill, the university\u2019s curator of birds, contends that the woodpecker is simply effective at eluding researchers and conservationists. Hill is a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement for Science and the American Ornithological Society. He teaches ornithology\u2014a branch of zoology dealing with the study of birds\u2014among his courses and is the author of the 2007 book \u201CIvorybill Hunters: The Search for Proof in a Flooded Wilderness.\u201D He discussed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s report, the effect of urbanization and climate change on bird habitats and more in this edition of Expert Answers.

Auburn professor details ways training educators of tomorrow has changed due to COVID-19 pandemic The education realm has been one of the sectors most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as educators, administrators, parents and students had to scramble to adjust to policies and guidelines put in place in the interest of public health. Faced with numerous obstacles from a variety of angles, educators have had to find creative ways to reach and teach students and adjust the way the teachers of tomorrow are trained. Auburn University\u2019s W. Gary Martin, the Emily R. and Gerald S. Leischuck Endowed Professor of mathematics in the Department of Curriculum and Teaching, describes the last year-and-a-half in higher education and examines how and if changes made in the wake of the pandemic will affect education training in the future. COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are unnecessary with available vaccines This editorial is not intended to offend, it is a plea for an acceptance of reality and to prevent unnecessary illness, misery and death. Without question COVID-19 is the preeminent epidemic of the U.S. in the past century. We have experienced 34.4 million diagnosed cases and possibly three times as many infections that were not confirmed because of deficiencies in testing and a high proportion of asymptomatic cases. We have lost 610,000 of our fellow citizens, also an undercount, leaving millions of grieving relatives. We have spent trillions on alleviating the economic fallout arising from necessary quarantines and shutdowns implemented to control the infection during at least 12 pre-vaccination months. Beef for Generations Beef has been on the dinner table throughout our history in modern society. When humankind transitioned from being hunters and gathers to farmers and ranchers, efficiency of our food supply chain increased. The efficiency of producing food has continued to increase throughout our recent past generations. Statistics show that in the 1930s one farmer fed four other people. In the 1970s the statistic was 73 people; and today, one farmer feeds approximately 170 people. The data indicates that one farmer has increased the number of people fed by two individuals each year since the Great Depression. Prior to 1950 the increase was only one person per year; but, during the latter half of the 20th century the annual increase in the number of people a farmer fed was 2.4 people. This rapid shift in the increase of efficiency of the American farmer and rancher is directly related to the development and implementation of technology in modern day agriculture. This is especially true for beef production systems. Today, the innovative development of genetics, management, nutrition and reproduction technologies into cow herds results in 36% fewer cattle needed to produce the same amount of beef that was produced in 1975. Implementation of these technologies developed by scientists at land grant universities, USDA and private industry has been the foundation of the increased efficiency in beef production. Auburn professors discuss country\u2019s attitude toward Asian culture, history of its portrayal in film industry Recently, U.S. President Joe Biden signed a law that aims to address a rising number of anti-Asian attacks.

Woodrow, Sr., Professor in Systems and Technology in Auburn University\u2019s Harbert College of Business, discusses the nation\u2019s recent surge in ransomware, which has become a national security risk. According to a report, the U.S. suffered from roughly 65,000 ransomware attacks last year\u2014most recently and notably the Colonial Pipeline, which temporarily shut down oil production on the East Coast. Cegielski has authored more than 60 research articles, focusing on cybersecurity and the inter-organizational use of cloud-based technologies. Auburn professors talk about importance of mental health in wake of Osaka\u2019s French Open withdrawal With Naomi Osaka\u2019s recent withdrawal from the French Open to focus on her mental health, the topic has moved to the forefront of public discussion. The 23-year-old\u2019s bold stand has served as a reminder of the importance of maintaining one\u2019s mental health in addition to one\u2019s physical health as a key to a balanced life. Overcoming COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy During the first week in June, it was estimated that 40% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and 60% have received one dose. The Biden Administration has set a goal of vaccinating 70% of the U.S. population by July 4, since in the region of 75-80% of our population should be immune to the predominant strain and variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Experience in South Africa, India and the European Union has demonstrated that a population with a high level of susceptibility and with an increasing incidence rate will result in the evolution of mutants. These may be more infectious and have greater pathogenicity than the original January 2020 strain, thereby delaying effective control of the pandemic. Auburn history professor discusses significance of Tulsa Race Massacre\u2019s 100th anniversary On May 31, 1921, an atrocity known as the Tulsa Race Massacre began in the thriving Greenwood District of the Oklahoma metropolis.

Zhang is the school\u2019s associate dean of research and serves an Alumni Professor and the George W. Peake Professor of Forest Economics Herd immunity and COVID-19: What you need to know Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person less likely. As a result, the whole community becomes protected, not just those who are immune. Often, a percentage of the population must be capable of getting a disease in order for it to spread. This is known as the herd immunity threshold. The percentage of a community that needs to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity varies from disease to disease. The more contagious a disease is, the greater the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to the disease to stop its spread. For example, the measles is a highly contagious illness. It is estimated that 94% of the population must be immune to interrupt the chain of transmission. Auburn University professors discuss vaccine hesitancy, stress importance of inoculation As the COVID-19 global pandemic persists and the country slowly inches its way toward herd immunity, many Americans remain reluctant to get the vaccine and demand for the much sought-after inoculation has waned in recent weeks. Everything from skepticism, personal beliefs, a \u201Cwait and see\u201D mentality and even misinformation have contributed to the waning of numbers of those signing up to get the vaccine. Auburn professor says food and agriculture vital to national security Professor Bob Norton, chair of the Auburn University Food System Institute\u2019s Food and Water Defense Working Group, discusses the importance of a safe and secure food chain, especially in connection with COVID-19 and cybersecurity. He says the pandemic has created problems, as well as opportunities, in the food and agriculture sector. The rise of COVID-19 variant viruses COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates are falling nationwide, but experts talk in dire terms about what will happen if variants of the virus are allowed to continue to surge this spring. There is a continual threat of emerging coronavirus variants that may increase the transmissibly, increase the disease-causing ability of the virus and\/or weaken the effectiveness of immunizations. Auburn psychology professor discusses importance of sleep for positive mental, physical health during pandemic Sleep is a billion-dollar industry, yet a good night\u2019s sleep is elusive to many, especially during these trying times as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers.

Vaccine administration: What went wrong, and can the pandemic be stopped solely using vaccination? In late December, the idea that safe, effective vaccines against COVID-19 had been created in less than a year seemed miraculous\u2014a triumph of science and American ingenuity. It took only six weeks to tarnish that image. Pride in the remarkable feat has been replaced by confusion, accusations of unfairness, frustrating waits and the nightmare of vaccine vials gathering dust while tens of thousands of people die of what is now a preventable disease. Is cryptocurrency going mainstream? Yes, but there's more to the story The recent market highs reached by Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies have sparked a dramatic uptick in interest in this 10-year-old class of digital currency. Fueled in part by renewed coverage in mainstream media and announcements of large purchases by hedge funds and traditional investment pools, Bitcoin and a handful of other leading cryptocurrencies are rapidly becoming embraced by merchants, financial institutions and consumers alike. Many experts believe that the higher-profile cryptocurrencies are on the brink of an explosion in popularity and value in the coming years. Approval of COVID-19 vaccines only the \u2018end of the beginning\u2019 Approval of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines by the FDA in mid-December and possibly two more in February does not necessarily represent the beginning of the end. To quote Winston Churchill at the time of the successful conclusion of the Battle of Britain in 1941, having the two vaccines available for administration by the end of 2020 is certainly \u201Cthe end of the beginning.\u201D In an insightful opinion article in the Dec. 4 edition of The Wall Street Journal, Dr. Tom Frieden, previously a director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted the logistic and epidemiologic restraints relating to vaccination in the presence of escalating incidence rates in most states, and elevated hospitalizations and mortality. Auburn psychology professor offers tips for celebrating holidays, planning for 2021 This time of year usually brings people together to celebrate the holidays.

Weese is long-time head of the Alabama Cooperative Extension Systems food safety and quality team, in addition to her role with AUFSI. The science behind the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates and when can we expect commercially available vaccine(s) Although politically comforting and expedient, science does not support the principle of \"herd immunity\" for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Herd immunity is the term used when a sufficient number of individuals within a population become infected and immune, so the virus will no longer be able to circulate. Herd immunity has never been achieved with any disease without an effective vaccine stimulating durable immunity. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge concerning the antibody status of those recovering from COVID-19 irrespective of whether they were asymptomatic or required supportive treatment. Besides the increasing mortality due to the virus, the proponents of herd-immunity ignore the long-term consequences of infection. The virus can cause both cardiac and neural changes in addition to fatigue in the so-called \u201Clong haulers.\u201D Therefore, the pandemic cannot be controlled until there is a safe and effective vaccine developed and administered to a significant number of people worldwide. This article will discuss the science behind the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates and when can we expect commercially available vaccine(s). Auburn University marketing professor comments on Black Friday and Cyber Monday expectations As the holiday shopping frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday are upon us, what can brick-and-mortar stores and online retailers expect this season? Dora Bock, associate professor of marketing in Auburn University\u2019s Harbert College of Business, comments on Nov. 27 Black Friday and Nov. 30 Cyber Monday sales predictions and trends. COVID-19 vaccine delivery brings unique supply chain management challenges In a recent Wall Street Journal article, \u201CCOVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Will Challenge Cargo Airlines,\u201D Doug Cameron, the WSJ\u2019s deputy bureau chief in Chicago, lays out what pharmaceutical makers, cargo shipper and the entire medical services industry will face in delivering yet-to-be-approved vaccines to hospitals, medical offices and pharmacies across the United States and around the globe. Cameron\u2019s article focuses on the air cargo segment of this specialized supply chain, which is already suffering from a shortage of planes equipped with the carefully controlled refrigeration transport and storage these vaccines will require. His findings in that segment of the vaccine supply chain raise real concerns and beg the question of what else needs to be done to ensure virtually every step in this critical health care delivery process succeeds.

Auburn professor emeritus: We need inexpensive, rapid, home-deployed tests to help stem the pandemic Prominent epidemiologists and medical professionals are advocating the introduction of an inexpensive rapid antigen immunoassay tests similar to a home pregnancy test. Prototype COVID-19 tests are being developed and are under evaluation to be commercially available later in the year. The demand for rapid tests is based on the reality that highly sensitive lab-based molecular (PCR) assays, which measure viral RNA, may not yield a result for most people even those with symptoms for periods from four to 10 days. Economics professor sees U.S. moving toward cashless society in future For safety reasons, many retailers are requesting contactless forms of payment during a transaction. Those retailers who do accept cash payments have been asking customers to use exact change.

COVID-19 vaccine studies give us hope, but a vaccine may not happen this year The purpose of vaccination is to stimulate the immune response to prevent a disease. A person who is rendered resistant to a disease by vaccination is termed \u201Cactively immunized.\u201D Active immunity may also result from recovery from a natural outbreak of a disease. Immunity transferred from plasma from a donor, which contains antibodies from a prior infection or vaccination is referred to as \u201Cpassive immunity.\u201D This type of immunity is immediate, but only temporary and is used mainly for treatment of hospitalized individuals. Various laboratories are also developing synthetic antibodies called \u201Cmonoclonal antibodies\u201D in cell cultures, which can be mass-produced for treatment of seriously ill patients.
