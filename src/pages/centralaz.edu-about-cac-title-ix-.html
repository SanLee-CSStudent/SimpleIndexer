Sex Needs a New Metaphor \u201CFor some reason,\u201D says educator Al Vernacchio, \u201Cthe metaphors for talking about sex in the US all come from baseball \u2014 scoring, getting to first base, etc. The problem is, this frames sex as a competition, with a winner and a loser. Instead, he suggests a new metaphor, one that\u2019s more about shared pleasure, discussion and agreement, fulfillment and enjoyment. Let\u2019s talk about \u2026 pizza.\u201D *This talk was presented at an official TED conference.

Bystander Tips BYSTANDER TIPS Warning Signs Being able to tell the difference between healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationships can be more difficult than you would think. No two relationships are the same, so what\u2019s unhealthy in one relationship may be abusive in another. Although there are many signs to pay attention to in a relationship, look for these common warning signs of dating abuse: Checking cell phones, emails or social networks without permission Extreme jealousy or insecurity Constant belittling or putdowns Explosive temper Isolation from family and friends Making false accusations Constant mood swings towards you Physically inflicting pain or hurt in any way Possessiveness Telling someone what they can and cannot do Repeatedly pressuring someone to have sex With permission from Break The Cycle in an effort to inspire and support young adults to build healthy relationships and create a society without abuse. Because EVERYONE deserves to be in a healthy, loving and caring relationship. Active Bystander Central Arizona College encourages all members of the Community to be Active Bystanders against sexual violence. Learn to recognize the signs of danger and develop plans to keep each other safe. Commit to being an Active Bystander. Take a Healthy Relationship Quiz Have a plan. Talk with your friends about your plans BEFORE you go out. Do you feel like drinking? Are you interested in hooking up? Where do you want to go? Having a clear plan ahead of time helps friends look after one another. Go out together. Go out as a group and come home as a group; never separate and never leave your friend(s) behind. Watch out for others. If you are walking at night with friends and notice a woman walking by herself in the same direction, ask her to join you so she doesn\u2019t have to walk alone. Diffuse situations. If you see a friend coming on too strong to someone who may be too drunk to make a consensual decision, interrupt, distract, or redirect the situation. If you are too embarrassed or shy to speak out, get someone else to step in. Trust your instincts. If a situation or person doesn\u2019t seem \u201Cright\u201D to you, trust your gut and remove yourself, if possible, from the situation.

How does Title IX apply to pregnant or parenting students? Per the requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, students will not be discriminated against on the basis of pregnancy. This includes discrimination against a student based on pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions. Does CAC have to excuse my absences due to my pregnancy, childbirth, or abortion? Your school must excuse your absences due to pregnancy or any related conditions for as long as your doctor says it is necessary for you to be absent. When you return to school, you must be reinstated to the status you held before your leave. The school may require you to submit a doctor\u2019s note only if that is required of students with other medical conditions. Classmates and even professors have made offensive comments to me about my pregnancy. Should I report it to the Title IX office? Title IX requires schools to prevent and address sex-based harassment, including harassment based on pregnancy. If you experience this sort of treatment at school, you should seek help immediately. The law prohibits the school from retaliating against you for making a complaint or raising a concern. I want to return to school three days after I have the baby, so I don\u2019t fall too far behind, but my professor thinks I should take more time off to recover. What should I do? Your school must leave it up to you and your doctor to decide when you can return to continue your studies. In addition, the school cannot have a rule that prohibits students from returning to classes for a set period of time after childbirth. For questions and\/or any concerns, please contact the Title IX Coordinator, Laura Shepherd (520) 494-5106 or titleix@centralaz.edu. Information from National Women\u2019s Law Center www.nwlc.org.
