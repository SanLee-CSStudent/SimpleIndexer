Students who enroll in High School Programs may receive a tuition waiver covering up to six (6) credits of in-state tuition per semester (fall\/spring\/summer semesters are eligible). Students are responsible for the costs of books, class materials and transportation, should the course take place on a CAC campus. The Early College Scholarship tuition waiver may only be used for CAC courses at or above 100 level. It is the responsibility of the student to verify high school course credit eligibility with a guidance counselor prior to enrollment in a college course.
