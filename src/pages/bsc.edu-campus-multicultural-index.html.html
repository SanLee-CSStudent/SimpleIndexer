People are different, and BSC has helped me understand how to embrace those differences in everyday life and have an open mind.\u201D \u2013 Roger Wang \u201919 BSC is committed to honoring diversity and protecting the dignity of all individuals. We foster an inclusive campus culture so that all can learn and grow together. We encourage all students to explore their own perspectives and those of others, including worldviews formed by race, ethnicity, gender, national origin, abilities, and sexual orientation. At BSC, the Office of Multicultural Affairs works to create global citizens prepared to thrive in diverse environments. The student-led Cross Cultural Committee and other student groups provide direction and support.
