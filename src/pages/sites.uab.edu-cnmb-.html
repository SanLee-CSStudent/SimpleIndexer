Now Recruiting for 2022 REU Posted on January 4, 2022April 18, 2022Author chcadenhCategories What's Going On: REU News NSF Division of Materials Research (DMR) supported Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Alabama at Birmingham is inviting applications for the Summer 2022. REU-projects may include, but not be limited to, in five research clusters: (1) computational materials research\/machine learning (2) materials under extreme conditions (3) materials for energy applications, (4) materials for sensors and laser applications, and (5) biomaterials for implants, tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. This REU experience will be offered as an in person research model as well as a hybrid model which will include fully remote participation for computational research projects and partly remote and partly on ground lab experiences for experimental research projects (depending on the research project). The undergraduates will carry out the analysis of data generated in their research projects and make presentations on completed research to faculty mentors and other undergraduates participating in this program. All participants are required to participate a campus-wide expo at the end of the program. The program will offer 10-weeks flexible summer program during May 22, 2022 \u2013 July 29, 2022. The program will pay $6,000 over the entire 10-week period involving 400 hours of research with a faculty mentor at UAB (based on a 40 hour work week). PLEASE SHARE WITH UNDERGRADUATES. For program information contact Program Director Yogesh Vohra (ykvohra@uab.edu) and for application questions contact Program Coordinator Charita Cadenhead (charita@uab.edu).

It was an amazing opportunity to learn more about my research and about the subject of plasma physics in general. Due to a significant spike in COVID-19 cases in Alabama, experts advised that holding the conference digitally, rather than in person, would be the safest option for all participants. This was my first academic conference, and despite the fact that it was virtual, I felt the same levels of pressure and excitement as if it had been held in person. Some aspects of a virtual conference were more advantageous, such as the option to watch sessions on demand, which allowed me to watch more of the conference than I would have been able to if the conference had been conducted in person. After watching a few speakers, I was intimidated to be in the midst of so many amazing minds, and I was apprehensive about how my presentation would compare to theirs. I had to reassure myself that I was just as deserving of being there as they were, and that I shouldn\u2019t compare myself to them. A Zoom meeting titled \u201CWomen in Science\u201D was one of the live events I attended. Several successful female scientists moderated the event, sharing their experiences as women in a male-dominated profession. I appreciated attending this conference as it was educational and refreshing to hear from women who had had similar experiences to myself and how they overcame gender bias. The fact that the number of women in science is increasing every day and that the field of science is changing to become more inclusive and tolerant left me feeling encouraged after the conference to continue with my studies and research in science. I was able to present my findings at my live poster session with ease and confidence thanks to extensive preparation with Dr. Renato Camata, my research mentor throughout the summer REU program, as well as with our research group. My experience at the Gaseous Electronics Conference gave me the confidence to present scientific findings in front of other professionals, and it served as good practice for larger conference presentations that I may participate in in the future.
