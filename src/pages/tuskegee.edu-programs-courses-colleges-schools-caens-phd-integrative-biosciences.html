By the end of the first academic year, students are required to have identified two co-advisors and formed a Student Advisory Committee, which will be responsible for facilitating the development of the academic coursework plan and the research design. The co-advisors must be from two different disciplines, both of which must be integral to the proposed dissertation research. The Student Advisory Committee will consist of a minimum of four faculty members, at least two of whom must be knowledgeable in the student's area of research; one must be from outside the student's research area and at least three must be members of the IBS Ph.D. program faculty. A key feature of the IBS Ph.D. program is the co-advisor concept. These co-advisors will expose students to different perspectives and encourage and facilitate design and completion of a research dissertation that addresses a problem from at least two different but complementary perspectives. Candidacy, Dissertation and Graduation Admission To Candidacy Requirements for admission to candidacy are: Completion of all course work required for the Ph.D. Program; Passing a written qualifying exam; Successful oral presentation of research proposed to the Student Advisory Committee; and Submission of an application for admission to candidacy. Oral Defense Of Dissertation Upon completion of the coursework and research for the program, the student-through his\/her advisory committee-may request that the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research arrange a final oral examination to meet the degree requirements. The Dean of Graduate Studies and Research will appoint a dissertation committee consisting of all Advisory Committee members and one member from outside the university. The student must submit a completed copy of the dissertation to each member of the examination committee at least two weeks prior to the date of the exam. The focus of the oral examination will be the student's research. Approval of at least four members of the dissertation committee is necessary for the student to pass the oral examination. Changes And Review Of Progress Only the IBS Dean's Council may approve changes in a student's area of specialization, co-advisors, or Student Advisory Committee members, and such change(s) must be requested through the IBS Ph.D. Program Office. In the event the approval cannot be secured, the student may directly petition the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. The Student Advisory Committee will review the student's progress at least once each semester and forward a formal report to the IBS Ph.D. Program Office and the IBS Dean's Council. The Student Advisory Committee will recommend to the IBS Dean's Council whether to continue, place on probation, suspend or dismiss the student from the graduate program. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.0 is allowed one semester to raise the GPA to 3.0. Failure to do so will result in expulsion from the program. Students who fail the qualifying examination after two attempts may apply for a terminal Master's degree in any of the established programs at Tuskegee University. In such cases, the student will have to meet the oral examination requirements of the Graduate School. Submission of the Dissertation Students must submit seven corrected copies of their dissertation signed by all members of the Student Advisory Committee and respective College Dean(s) to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Residency Requirement IBS Ph.D. students are required to be located at Tuskegee University for at least two years during the course of doctoral study. Time Limit for Graduation All graduate credit submitted in fulfillment of requirements for the Ph.D. degree must have been earned within the six years immediately preceding conferral of the degree. IBS- REU Program (Summer) The Tuskegee University Integrative Biosciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates (IBS-REU) site provides a research program for undergraduates. The program was initiated in Summer 2009 as a result of funding by the National Science Foundation. Since its inception, over 40 undergraduate students from across the country have participated in this ten-week research program in the area of integrative biosciences. Tuskegee University IBS-REU site offers undergraduates (rising juniors and seniors in the STEM majors, but particularly in Biology, Chemistry, Animal Sciences, Plant and Soil Sciences, Agricultural Economics, and other bioscience majors) a novel approach to conduct research by integrating multiple areas in the biosciences. We define \u201Cintegrative biosciences\u201D research as any research where the continued integration of two or more science disciplines is requisite, for example, determining the consequences of genetically-modified sweetpotato (Plant Genomics, Plant Sciences) on soil microbial biodiversity (Soil Science, Soil Microbiology, Genetics). Tuskegee University is located in Tuskegee, Alabama, which is 40 miles east of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, Alabama, and 20 miles west of the city of Auburn, Alabama. It is also within easy driving distance to the cities of Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. Tuskegee is an Historical Black College and University and an 1890 land-grant institution that enrolls more than 3,000 students and employs approximately 900 faculty and support personnel.

Other IBS PhD Program requirements include the following: Teaching requirement: All IBS Fellows must teach one course that is approved by their co-mentors Internship requirement: All IBS Fellows must complete one semester-long internship requirement as approved by their co-mentors. All IBS fellows must complete qualifying exams. The first qualifying exam is a comprehensive written exam that is given in December of the student\u2019s third year to all members of a student\u2019s entering class that have been enrolled full-time in the IBS program and that includes topics covered in the IBS Core Curriculum. The exam is graded pass\/fail by the IBS core instructors. A student has 2 chances to pass qualifiers. If the student does not pass qualifiers after the 2nd try the student must be terminated form the IBS Program. The second Qualifying exam is given by the student\u2019s dissertation committee during the spring of the students\u2019 3rd year. This exam is also graded pass\/fail and each fellow has up to 2 chances to pass. Failure to pass on the second try will result in termination from the program. Submission of their dissertation proposal to the IBS Deans Council by the end of the summer of their 3rd year. Application to candidacy by the end of the summer of their 3rd year. Professional courtesy, excellent academic progress (\u201CB\u201D or better in all courses), and availability of funding are also requisite for successful progression through the IBS PhD Program. Approval of the completion of their dissertation research and dissertation document by the IBS Deans\u2019 Council. Successful defense of the dissertation research. The IBS PhD Program requires all fellows to have at least 2 co-mentors to guide them through the completion of their dissertation research and all program components must be ultimately approved by the IBS Deans Council. Why IBS? \u201CThe IBS PhD Program\u2019s benefits to Tuskegee are beyond economical assessment and calculations. It cannot be assessed in terms of dollars spent or gained, position vacancies and infrastructure upgrades. The IBS program, in itself, is a valuable asset, a part of STEM infrastructure, a corner stone for graduate studies, and a long-term investment in future leaders and pioneers in all STEM fields. Higher education institutions take pride in their PhD programs and in the number of doctorates they graduate. Ranking of higher education institutions depends on research excellence and\/or influence, student choices and eventual success, which depends on the quality and the number of doctorates PhD Programs graduate. All IBS fellows are working on top-notch research projects throughout the campus and beyond, generating tomorrow\u2019s science discoveries and achievements. IBS fellows are tutors, advisors, near-peer mentors, and models to graduate and undergraduate students. Within the next 20 years, IBS program graduates will be key leaders in government, universities and decision-making institutions nationwide and around the world. This is a unique program in any and each aspect. IBS graduates are Tuskegee\u2019s future generation of educators, researchers, faculty members and administrators that believe in, embrace and value Tuskegee\u2019s history, mission and legacy. Investing in your kids is never a wasted investment and mother Tuskegee\u2019s investment in the IBS program is no different.\u201D-Amged Dafalla, (Entering Class of 2010), Summer 2014 IBS Courses IBS CORE CURRICULUM COURSE OFFERINGS IBSC 540.
