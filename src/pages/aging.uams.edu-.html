Reynolds... Welcome to the UAMS Donald W. Reynolds Institute on Aging, where the needs of the aging generation are met with the highest standards of service, research, and care currently available. The Reynolds Institute on Aging building, was dedicated in 2000, and was made possible through a generous gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation. In 2012, the Institute on Aging at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation dedicated four new floors that were built atop the existing institute\u2019s building which expanded research and education capabilities. Here at the Institute on Aging, the focus is not adding years to life, rather, its adding life to years!
