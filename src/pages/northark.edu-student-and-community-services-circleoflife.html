As part of the Healthy Families America Model, Circle of Life works with young mothers to provide a nurturing environment for their children and to learn a variety of skills for a more productive life. Studies show that babies are born to learn and parents are their child's first and most influential teacher. Circle of Life helps young moms to be their child's first teacher through our Ages and Stages Developmental Assessments. School readiness is a top priority for all young mothers in this program. Through monthly group meetings, the families of Circle of Life come together for a nice meal, free childcare, and a safe space to discuss the issues that life brings. Circle of Life currently serves families from Boone, Newton, Carroll, and Marion counties. To be eligible, young moms must be 24 years old or younger, pregnant or parenting. The child can be no older than 3 months old at enrollment.
