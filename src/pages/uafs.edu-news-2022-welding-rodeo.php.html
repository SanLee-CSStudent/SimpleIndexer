Wyatt McElrath, Dayton Pettycord, and Cory Buckman, all representing Western Yell County High School, snared first, second, and third place honors and $2,000 UAFS scholarships at the annual Welding Rodeo. Dallas Smith from St. Paul High School had the top Written Safety Exam. The 59 students registered for the competition represent 10 school districts in the region and attend high schools that teach welding as part of their agriculture and general technology programs. \u201CThe UAFS Welding Rodeo is an opportunity for area high school students to compete in a fun and educational experience while highlighting the UAFS welding program,\u201D said Amanda Seidenzahl, Director of the Western Arkansas Technical Center. \u201CUAFS has a phenomenal welding program that prepares students with industry required skillsets that align with the American Welding Society certification. In addition to the competition, participants have the opportunity to talk with local and regional businesses and learn more about employment opportunities in the area.\u201D Seidenzahl also noted that the high school instructors accompanying the students engaged in professional development at the event, conducted by industry partners Airgas and Lincoln Electric. Students who take concurrent courses through the Western Arkansas Technical Center assisted in the event, organizing and guiding the contestants through their various rotations. WATC welding students receive concurrent credit at their high schools and UAFS, earning certificates of proficiency in trades with good prospects for employment at graduation. Many will go on to complete further education, like the associate degree in welding at UAFS \u2013 possibly with the winners by their sides. Students at the rodeo competed in timed arc and MIG welding and took a written exam. Judges were UAFS instructors and Advanced Welding Institute-certified welders. Event sponsors were Abscom, Airgas, Boyd Metals, Hytrol, Lincoln Electric, and Ryerson. In addition to scholarships, prizes like welding hoods, torch sets, and grinders were awarded.
