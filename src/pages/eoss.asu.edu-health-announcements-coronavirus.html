This is Arizona State University\u2019s official source of information about COVID-19 and important information for the ASU community. The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention has the most up-to-date information about the status of COVID-19 in the U.S. You also can find more from the Arizona Department of Health Services. Latest COVID-19 Update Update to ASU face coverings policy, Daily Health Check March 14, 2022 As it has throughout the pandemic, Arizona State University continues to follow health protocol guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Feb. 25, the CDC announced changes to its guidelines that allow people to go without face coverings indoors in most counties in the United States. The CDC\u2019s new metrics look at caseloads, hospitalizations and local hospital capacity. Under these metrics, roughly 70% of U.S. counties are deemed areas of low to medium risk and therefore fall under the new guidance of going maskless indoors in many situations. Only those areas that are still a high risk require masks indoors, according to the CDC. Maricopa County, where ASU\u2019s four metro Phoenix campuses are located, is in the medium category. ASU also has locations in Los Angeles County, California, (low risk); the District of Columbia (low); Pima and Mohave counties in Arizona (both medium). The exception is the Yuma location: Yuma County remains high risk, so all employees, students and visitors at the Yuma location are required to wear a face cover while inside ASU buildings, regardless of vaccination status. (Check any county\u2019s status at the CDC\u2019s county check website.) At ASU, face coverings are recommended but not required starting March 14, 2022, across campus. Signs will be placed inside buildings to note any areas where face coverings are still required, such as in health care settings. Face coverings will still be required on intercampus shuttles, per federal guidelines. In addition, the Daily Health Check is optional starting March 14. People may choose to wear a face covering at any time. If you are at high risk for severe illness, talk to your health care provider about whether you need to wear a face covering and take other precautions. Those with symptoms, a positive test or exposure to someone with COVID-19 should follow CDC guidelines and wear a face covering if in public. The university continues to expect the ASU community to stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccines and to get tested regularly, especially for those experiencing symptoms.
