Northeast Alabama Community College (NACC) held its annual Arts and Humanities Speakers Forum on April 7, 2022, with writers Beth Ann Fennelly and Harrison Scott Key. The focus of this year\u2019s forum was \u201CUsing Humor to Tell the Story.\u201D Beth Ann Fennelly is the author of The Tilted World, Heating and Cooling: 52 Micro-Memoirs, Open House, Tender Hooks, Unmentionables, and Great with Child: Letters to a Young Mother. She is the former Mississippi Poet Laureate and teaches in the MFA Program at the University of Mississippi. Her poetry has been published in over fifty anthologies, including Best American Poetry. Harrison Scott Key, author of The World\u2019s Largest Man and Congratulations! Who are You Again? is the 2016 winner of the James Thurber Prize for American Humor and has worked at Savannah College of Art and Design as chair of liberal arts, professor of English and writing, and executive dean. In addition to discussing their work, the authors read excerpts from their works and were interviewed by Don Noble, host of Bookmark. Dr. David Campbell, President of NACC, began the Arts and Humanities Speaker\u2019s Forum in 1993. Since that first year, the Forum has hosted such writers as Tom Franklin, Silas House, Michael Knight, George Singleton, Mark Powell, Janisse Ray, Mary Hood, Dori Sanders, Thomas Cook, Ron Rash, Pam Duncan, Sena Jeter Naslund, Robert McCammon, and Joshilyn Jackson. Over 200 were in attendance for the morning session and 70 were in attendance for the afternoon Master Classes which were held with each author. In addition to the NACC student body, faculty, and staff, there were faculty and students from Calhoun Community College and faculty from Chattanooga State Community College. Joan Reeves, Chair of the English and Fine Arts Division, noted, \u201CThis event has always been such an important one for our students, faculty, staff, and community. We were delighted to be able to bring entertaining writers like Beth Ann Fennelly and Harrison Scott Key to our campus. Dr. Campbell showed great vision when he created this forum in 1993, and because of this, we are very fortunate to have been able to have brought such exemplary Southern writers to NACC over the last twenty-nine years.\u201D The NACC chapter of Sigma Kappa Delta does have some signed copies of books by these authors available.
