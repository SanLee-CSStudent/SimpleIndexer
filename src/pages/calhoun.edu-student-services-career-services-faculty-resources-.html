I doubt I would have even applied to the position if you hadn\u2019t encouraged me to. Thank you so much for your guidance and help through the whole process.\u201D \u2013 Calhoun Alumni Co-Op Opportunities Cooperative Learning is a structured educational strategy-integrating classroom studies with learning through productive work experiences in a field related to a student\u2019s academic or career goals. It provides progressive experiences in integrating theory and practice. Co-op is a partnership among students, educational institutions and employers with specified responsibilities for each party. In order to promote co-op opportunities to students, we have a 15-minute overview of the advantages of co-op and speak about positions that are available at that time. www.calhoun.edu\/coop Introduction to FOCUS & Discussing Results An assessment such as FOCUS 2, our free online assessment tool, can help students better articulate their values, interests, skills, and personality. In this 15-minute introduction, we discuss the purpose and benefits of assessments in career planning, demonstrate FOCUS, and distribute a sheet for students to complete and discuss in a later class session. (15 minutes) After completing the FOCUS assessment, students bring summary results and an assigned worksheet to class. We will provide insight into students\u2019 results, answer questions, and show how the instrument can be used as a resource for additional career exploration. (30\u201345 minutes or based on time available) www.calhoun.edu\/focus Networking and the Informational Interview Encourage students to get the inside scoop on careers by speaking to people in the field. Personal connections are a vital part of career exploration and planning. Students will learn how to make professional connections and begin to develop a personal networking plan. Informational interviewing allows students to learn about occupations, positions, and organizations. We\u2019ll discuss how and where to find contacts, what to ask, and the importance of following up. (30\u201345 minutes) Career Event Promotions Students report they are most likely to attend events when encouraged by faculty. We would love to visit your class to promote job fairs and career services workshops. Your students will thank you later! (10 minutes) Hosting Mock Interviews Sure, we want to prepare students for a productive, fulfilling, long-term career following graduation, but how do we facilitate that environment at the college-level? With mock interviews, we are able to walk students through the employment process by leading discussions covering job applications, resume building and interviewing skills. Implementing this preparation into your coursework, students will be able to have firsthand experience by completing a mock interview conducted by current employers. Interviews are coordinated by career services and can be utilized in any classroom setting. (Times vary depending on class size) \u201CThe process went well and made for a valuable learning experience for us and our students. What started as a simple learning exercise for our class, also opened new opportunities for some select students. The industry lead interviews resulted in some students being called for second interviews and job offers. So far three students have been hired and hopefully more will in the coming days. We once again would like to thank Kelli and Rachel, and strongly recommend this process to everyone.\u201D \u2013Zeb F. Presentations can be customized to fit your class needs.
