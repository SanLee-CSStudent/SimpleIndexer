Richard served the Parker region for nearly 44 years as a high school teacher, coach, and mentor, including time as a member of various state-wide vocational boards. Richard also helped bring college courses to high school students, and he helped establish college Nursing and Administration of Justice programs in Parker. He was part of the group that launched the Western Arizona Vocational Education Joint Technical District (WAVE JTED) in Parker, and he served on that board for two years. In 2014 he was appointed to the Arizona Western College District Governing Board, and was reelected in 2020. Under his leadership, AWC has dramatically impacted lives of students in La Paz counties through his advocacy. Richard grew up in Moroni, Utah, in a farming family that raised cows, pigs, alfalfa, and oats. In high school Richard raised 100 show turkeys each year as a member of FFA, and won 1st place in his weight class each of the four years. Richard was called to an LDS mission in the deep south during the height of the Civil Rights movement and was in Montgomery, Alabama on the day Martin Luther King, Jr. marched there from Selma. Richard is a First-Generation college student, who attended Snow College and BYU Provo to earn a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Education. He later earned a Master\u2019s degree in Business Education by studying at ASU, NAU, UofA, BYU Hawaii and University of Phoenix. Richard started teaching in the part of Arizona formerly known as the Northwest Yuma School District, now known as the Bicentennial School District. His first job was teaching business classes at Salome High School, where he spent 11 years. During that time, he took several classes from AWC professors who traveled to Parker to teach, and dreamed of expanding that service to a greater number of students. Richard then spent 33 years at Parker High School teaching and directing Career Tech Education, and building out concurrent and dual education college courses for high school students. Richard was drawn to college District Governing Board service to help connect the citizens of La Paz County to the college and to build out and improve college services to the county.

He also prioritizes opportunities to engage with students, learn about their dreams, challenges and what they are studying. 2021 AWC Hall of Fame Inductee Mario Jauregui As a student of migrant workers with limited education, Mario was focused on the opportunities college could provide him. With a start at AWC, Mario charted a course for himself that made him into a local and international business leader with deep roots and a philanthropic spirit that has impacted countless lives in Arizona and Sonora. Mario says living and studying at Arizona Western College was \"exactly\u201D what he needed to springboard him into classes at AWC as a junior. He came to AWC from KOFA High School and was very determined to rise to the academic level of a college environment. He took Micro and Macro Economics, American History, and Marriage and Dating. He chose to live on campus because he loved the independence of being on his own but not too far away from his family in San Luis, Arizona. He worked at the Student Union Game Room, attended college athletic events, movie nights, and pick up basketball games. While he has his hands in many local non-profit organizations, Mario wears his AWC alumni status like a badge of honor, promoting the college across the community. He has served on the Yuma Regional Medical Center Board, the Greater Yuma Economic Development board, as well as organizations including Yuma Community Foundation, Greater Yuma Port Authority, San Luis Economic Development Corporation, Rotary Club of San Luis and the San Luis, Sonora, Mexico Industry Chamber of Commerce (CANACINTRA). When Mario sees a need, he tries to meet it. He committed to 10 years of scholarships for San Luis High School seniors; he has donated water filtration systems to elementary schools in San Luis, Mexico; and for over two decades he has financially supported the exportation of donated building supplies for families in need in San Luis, Mexico. The greater Arizona \u2013 Sonora region has benefited tenfold from Mario\u2019s career journey that began on the campus of Arizona Western College. 2021 AWC Hall of Fame Inductee Bruce Jacobson Norman Bruce Jacobson has lived a life of service to the communities of Yuma and La Paz Counties through his visionary development, his leadership, and his service. Bruce was elected to the Arizona Western College District Governing Board and served from 1980 \u2013 1984, during the tumultuous time when residents upriver decided to split from Yuma County and create La Paz County, making AWC a two-county college district. While serving on the board, Bruce notes that the board learned to listen well to each other to work through differences of opinion in order to achieve a greater good. Because of the respect members developed for each other, they were able to meet challenges head on with unanimous or near-unanimous votes, with greater understanding and better decisions. Bruce came to Yuma in the mid-1970's to join his brothers in Jacobson Realty & Development Company, now called Jacobson Companies. He is a registered civil engineer and land surveyor and established Jacobson Engineering upon his arrival with the company. Upon the death of his brother Larry in 1979 and the retirement of his brother Don in mid-1990's, Bruce has overseen the continued growth of the company. When economic downturns have occurred in our country, he has innovated new product lines to bring new ideas to the community. Bruce takes community-building very seriously. His proudest career achievement is participating in the development of over 12,000 residential lots and homes, as well as the development of many commercial projects that have helped local businesses grow and provided economic growth and employment to many. Watching Yuma grow in an orderly manner into the city it is today is a specific point of pride. He helped bring Boys and Girls Club to Yuma, and is the developer and co-owner of Ridgeview Transitional Rehabilitation facility. For nearly 14 years, Bruce served as the county engineer for the newly formed La Paz County, during which time the Colorado river was flooding periodically. Bruce was selected by the US Department of the Interior to resolve the issue and develop plans for future water deliveries to reservoirs along the river. Bruce has served his community through many church activities and leadership roles. He has been President, Vice President and board member for Kiwanis. Bruce has also served as Scout Master and helped many scouts to the rank of Eagle Scout. Most importantly, he has helped his wife raise ten children, seeing each of them obtain a college degree, many of them advanced degrees, and watching them raise their families as good citizens. 2021 AWC Hall of Fame Inductee Amanda Aguirre Senator Amanda Aguirre has worked for decades to improve the health and lives of countless children and families during her career in the greater Yuma County region. In 2003, Ms. Aguirre became the first female and first Hispanic to represent District 24 (new legislative district 4) in the Arizona House of Representatives and then the Arizona State Senate (2006-2010). During her time in office, Senator Aguirre had success in passing key bi-partisan legislation. Among her many legislative accomplishments, she sponsored an Autism Spectrum Disorder \u201CSteven\u2019s Law,\u201D which requires private medical insurance to provide Autism intervention services under their insurance benefits. She was appointed in 2000 by President Clinton to serve in the US-Mexico Border Health Commission. Prior to elected office and her medical administrator role, she served as the Director of AWC Services, South Yuma County from 1995 to 2001, where she tripled enrollment in at the center and increased the delivery of courses beyond English as a Second Language to include Math, Business, Child Development, Music, Arts for Seniors and Computers.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Aguirre initiated timely provision of health care, with ongoing COVID-19 testing services across Yuma and La Paz Counties, through San Luis Walk-In Clinic. Locations included Arizona Western College campus, essential business and services such as nursing homes, prisons, the U.S. Border Patrol stations in the Yuma area, for farmers and farm workers in the region's significant agriculture industry. Ms. Aguirre is an outstanding health care leader and state leader with partnerships and relationships that extend far beyond the boundaries of her former constituency. In 1991 she helped establish the Binational Health and Environmental Council between Yuma County and San Luis Rio Colorado to address public health issues and health professional shortages, which resulted in new resources from the Center for Disease Control to create the first-ever binational Tuberculosis Control Program in the Arizona-Mexico border. 2020 Hall of Fame Inductee Gonzalo Huerta, Sr. There are several reasons why Gonzalo Huerta, Sr. is honored in the AWC Hall of Fame. He is a product of the college, a former student who went on to make significant contributions to his community and his field of study. He is also a highly-respected colleague who over 30 years helped build the AWC Welding program, mentoring and nurturing students. When interviewed for the college\u2019s 50th Anniversary in 2015, Professor Huerta said \u201CAWC Is a family. My son, who is now a local welding teacher, literally grew up at that AWC welding lab.\u201D He also said, \u201CExcept for my oldest sister, who graduated from high school in Texas, all five of my siblings went to AWC. AWC is responsible for all five of us having good careers and excellent opportunities. We\u2019ve been able to raise our families comfortably. Having a community college locally was very important. Culturally, being Hispanic, it\u2019s hard to leave family. Having AWC right here was very fortunate for us.\u201D The son of migrant workers, education was an established priority for his parents. They moved for seasonal work but never at the expense of their kids completing their schooling, or starting the school year on time. Gonzalo graduated from Yuma High in 1967 and enrolled immediately at AWC, completing a dual major of Welding Technology and Manufacturing Technology in 2 years. He started teaching at the college and then enrolled at Arizona State University and completed a degree of Industrial Technology at NAU, all while continuing his teaching career at AWC. He also completed a master\u2019s degree in Community College Administration from NAU, and became the Division Chair of Industrial Technology and Agricultural Science. Mr. Huerta was known as a strict but tireless advocate for his students, and frequently planned family trips around welding competitions, so his students could experience an out-of-town event. He challenged his students and brought out the best in them. After retiring from AWC, he became the Dean of Instruction for Applied Sciences at Imperial Valley College where he continued to touch the lives of hundreds of students, and he has contributed countless hours as a volunteer judge at welding competitions. 2020 Hall of Fame Inductee Dr. Jim Carruthers Dr. Jim Carruthers dedicated 28 years of his life to Arizona Western College, including 12 as President from 1984-1996, demonstrating dynamic and visionary leadership. After retiring from AWC, Dr. Carruthers served four two-year terms in the Arizona House of Representatives, bringing perspective as a strong advocate for education across the state. Dr. Carruthers changed the landscape of AWC and the surrounding educational environment profoundly through his work to create and implement the higher educational consortium model that brought a formal 2+2 partnership with Northern Arizona University, opening the doors for students to receive Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s and even Doctoral degrees without having to move away from Yuma. This paved the way for University of Arizona and Arizona State University to formalize their transfer partnerships and led to all three schools holding in-person classes in Yuma County, hosting entire degree programs here, and co-hosting a shared commencement ceremony which is the only one of its kind across the state. As an emblem of his work to build these partnerships and his endless pursuit of excellence in education, the NAU Research and Education building on the Yuma campus was named for Dr. Carruthers in 2009. Carruthers\u2019 relationship with the college began in 1969 when he was hired as the Financial Aid Director. He went on to serve as the Director of Housing and Student Activities, Assistant Dean of Students and Dean of Students in addition to a stint as Assistant Football Coach before assuming the top role. It was 1988 when Carruthers signed an agreement with former NAU President Eugene Hughes to create NAU-Yuma. This partnership evolved into \u201CK-20 Educational Consortium\u201D through which students were afforded the option to complete all of their education, from kindergarten to doctoral work here in Yuma. This \u201Ceducational park\u201D located on 24th street in Yuma saw the development of multiple elementary schools, a middle school and a high school. As an outcome of his driving force behind the creation of this unique plan, several neighborhoods and businesses have arisen over the years and now surround the once-isolated AWC Yuma campus. This consortium concept brought national acclaim to AWC and was replicated around the country. During his time at the state legislature, Dr. Carruthers was instrumental in securing two different five million-dollar allocations for construction of two NAU facilities on the AWC Yuma campus. He also established six new education centers across the 10,000 square mile community college district, championed a district-wide interactive telecommunications distance learning program, and was a key strategist in a $20 million bond issue for campus infrastructure. In his nomination letter, a long-time colleague noted, Dr. Carruthers\u2019 leadership style was guided by two key concepts: one is that \u201CThe institution is the people that work there,\u201D so building strong relationships that foster an atmosphere of warmth, effectiveness, kindness, and success was critical. The second was the concept that all employees should be driven by the \u201Cexcitement of learning,\u201D which served as inspiration behind all of his decisions about how the college should serve students, staff, and the community. Colleagues remembered him as a \u201Cgenius with people\u201D and able to create a \u201Csense of community\u201D beyond just a place of work. 2020 Hall of Fame Inductee Charlene Fernandez Mrs. Charlene Fernandez is a remarkable example of an AWC graduate who has created a life rich in public service to uplift and improve the life of her neighbors. Charlene has been a public servant for virtually her entire career, serving the communities of Yuma County and the state of Arizona. She is one of the first official 2+2 graduates of the AWC-Northern Arizona University-Yuma partnership, finishing with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education. Charlene is a local product, born to parents residing in Yuma County, and graduated from Yuma High School, before enrolling at AWC. Just as she was completing her student teaching, the entirely new calling of public service gave her the chance to open Yuma\u2019s first office for U.S. Congressman Ed Pastor, raising the profile of Yuma in national decisions. She is most proud of her efforts during that time to help bring a Veterans Clinic to Yuma for the first time in history, removing the need for veterans to have to make the arduous trip to Phoenix or Tucson for treatment. Mrs. Fernandez later served Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano as a liaison for the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality in Yuma County, working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as its counterpart in the Republic of Mexico, to ensure that the air and water quality in Southwestern Arizona remained safe while ensuring that businesses faced minimal impact. After two years serving as the District Representative for U.S. Congressman Raul Grijalva, she ran and was elected to Arizona House of Representatives, where she has proven to be a fierce advocate for education, water, land use, commerce, transportation, and public safety. This advocacy has been recognized by many Arizona organizations representing arts groups, educators, and Latinx leadership. Her service includes eight years on the Yuma Union High School Board, with stints as Board President and Vice President. 2019 Hall of Fame Inductee: Dr. Don Schoening Dr. Donald Schoening\u2019s almost 13-year tenure as the 6th president of Arizona Western College yielded a 50 percent increase in enrollment. He served from 1997 to 2013. Under his leadership, a $74 million bond was passed by voters that allowed for construction of new buildings on the Yuma campus as well as the establishment of campus sites in San Luis, Quartzsite, Parker and Wellton. Under Schoening\u2019s leadership, he implemented many new practices at the district to increase productivity and build a positive culture. He also brought long-range planning to the district and annually published a 5-year vision for the district. Schoening oversaw the development of a facilities master plan that was shared with the campus community and the community at large. A 100-member citizen group helped pass the historic two-county $74 million bond in 2004 that allowed the college to open three more campuses and doubled the original campus academic buildings. The buildings themselves received several national architectural awards. Dr. Schoening developed new fiscal management practices through priority-based budgeting and new funding sources for the college through federal grants. The large solar installation on the Yuma campus came about through Dr. Schoening\u2019s leadership. Dr. Schoening is credited with enhancement of the AWC Foundation, and community adoption of a life-long learning model. Schoening oversaw the college during adoption of innovations like interactive television, online learning, and live televised coverage of classes, events and sports to the district. The modern approach to marketing, recruitment and assessment began under Schoening\u2019s leadership, and those key investments continue to pay dividends for the college district. Published during his presidency, Schoening\u2019s book \u201CRunning a Juice Stand: The 6 E\u2019s of Wise Management\u201D highlights successful business management practices he used while at AWC. Before assuming the presidency at AWC, Schoening was President of Independence Community College (Kansas). He also served 25 years at Wenatchee Valley College (Washington), in roles ranging from Personnel Officer, Director of Athletics, Vice President of Administrative Services and Vice President of Student Services. 2019 Hall of Fame Inductee: Dan Beaver Dan Beaver is a leader in community service,business, and governance of Parker, Arizona.

He has devoted his life to making Parker a better place to live. The \u201Csleepy little town along the Colorado River,\u201D as so many pundits describe Parker, is alive and kicking and poised to experience an economic resurgence, largely because of the vision of Mayor Beaver. Beaver has worked to keep alive Parker\u2019s largest event, an annual off-road race, which dates back to the mid-1970s. This event has huge economic impact on the area and when Parker was at risk of losing the national organization that produced the event, Dan nurtured a new partnership and sustained this highly-regarded event. Dan\u2019s commitment to economic development, public safety and opportunities for youth have been demonstrated by improvements and new investments in the area. Beaver\u2019s history of volunteerism and service spans almost five decades and includes dozens of positions and appointments, from the Chamber of Commerce, Economic Development, Parks and Recreation, Planning and Zoning, to Elks, Rotary, Little League and Industrial Arts-Welding coach.

Born in the small mining town of Miami, Arizona, Trujillo was raised with a strong work ethic and high regard for education. When he was 19, AWC Coach Ray Butcher, Jim Carruthers, and Paul Waddell gave him an opportunity to move to Yuma and help manage the football team, and that opportunity helped shape his life. Trujillo also spent time as the Student Head Resident of the De Anza Hall. Before he could complete, in July of 1973 Trujillo joined the U.S. Army and served 2 tours of duty in South Korea during the Vietnam Era. Upon his return to Yuma in 1976, he started his career at AWC as the Veteran Services Coordinator. Mr. Trujillo spent over 37 years advising students through their college careers, helping them achieve success while at AWC and into their professional careers. Trujillo served in many capacities, including Student Head Resident at De Anza Hall, Veteran Services Coordinator, Financial Aid Assistant Director, and Coordinator of Student Services in South County.

Arnold Trujillo loved his role as an encourager of students. He impacted many lives by just sharing his time and attention. He regularly advised students that education as a fundamental asset is something no one can take away. Mr. Trujillo lived and breathed AWC, and his positive impact on thousands of students is difficult to calculate. 2018 Hall of Fame Inductee 1983 Softball Championship Team 1983 Softball Team, National Champions The teammates on the 1983 softball team jelled early, and coach Charlie Dine \u201Csaid he thought way back in January his girls had a good chance (to play for a championship)\u201D according to an article in the August 15, 1983 edition of the Western Weekly. \u201CThe championship was very satisfying - to the players and the coaches,\u201D Dine said in the article by Joyce Christie. \u201CIt was a realization of all our goals. They all came true this year. At the national there wasn\u2019t anything better or bigger than here in the Arizona Conference.\u201D Two players on this roster were named to the NJCAA Softball All-Americans: Debbie Mygind (pitcher) and Missi Vassar (centerfield). Mygind was the nation\u2019s top strike-out pitcher, and Vassar led the country in RBI\u2019s. Six players were named to the all-conference team: Theresa Sims (third base), Nikki Woo (catcher) joined Mygind and Vassar on the first team, while Cindi Garcia (shortstop) and Tammy Braskett (second base) were named to the second team. Many players went on to university-level competition, including Vassar (Oklahoma State), Sims and Braskett (both to Northeast Louisiana University). Mygind spent the summer with the New Zealand National Team participating in the mini-world softball series in China. According to a story in the April 28, 1983 edition of the Western Weekly, Coach Dine said he hoped the team would peak during the tournament. \u201CAt least that\u2019s our goal,\u201D he said in an interview. He seemed philosophical about his team\u2019s errors and development, saying, \u201CErrors are going to happen. Hopefully, they have them out of their system. They still have the best record in the league. I wouldn\u2019t trade these kids for anyone else. They\u2019re a great bunch. The other teams still have to come to Yuma to face the dirty dozen.\u201D 1983 National Women\u2019s Fast Pitch Softball Champions: Co-Captain Missi Vassar Co-Captain Theresa Sims Nikki Woo Tina Leon Cindi Garcia Patty Sheals Jinny Iodice Tammy Braskett Monica Lopez Patty McNulty Debbie Mygind Dawn Draper 2018 Hall of Fame Inductee 1987 Softball Championship Team 1987 Softball Team, National Champions Bolstered by remarkable pitching from three players, the 1987 Softball team (54-11) dominated regular-season play and sailed to a national title with tough defense and great coaching. It\u2019s remarkable that the team\u2019s lead pitcher, Kim Stoner, earned top billing as the country\u2019s best. What\u2019s even more remarkable is the team included pitchers Kim Beatty and Adrianna Bojorquez, who finished fifth and seventh in the nation - creating a pitching juggernaut. That powerhouse was coached on the field by ACCAC Player of the Year and AWC catcher Tammy Turner, who called every pitch from behind the plate. Just as noteworthy is the way this team took the national title: by winning 1-0 over Illinois Central College in a game that started after midnight in between storms. The game was originally scheduled for 12:30 p.m., but was postponed for a rain delay. The decision to begin play after midnight - 12:40 a.m., to be exact - was approved by both teams because the forecast for the next 4 days included an 80 percent chance of rain. Three players on this roster were named to the NJCAA Softball All-American Team: Turner (catcher) and Brandi Hust (infielder) were named to the first team, and Stoner (pitcher), the NJCAA national tournament MVP, was named to the second team. 1987 National Women\u2019s Fast Pitch Softball Champions: Lora Prince Tammy Turner Kim Carroll Brandi Hust Clark Noreena Mares Julie Grounds Jackie O'Connor Kim Beatty Brooks Adrianna Bojorquez Kim Stoner (deceased) Carmen Domingues (deceased) 2018 Hall of Fame Inductee Charlie Dine Arizona Western College will induct the 1983 and 1987 championship softball teams along with late head coach Charlie Dine into the AWC Hall of Fame on Saturday, April 20, 2019. The day\u2019s events will start at 10:00 a.m. on the Yuma Campus in the Frances Morris Board Room (3C). The itinerary begins with introductions and an awards ceremony followed by a campus tour leading to the Charlie Dine Softball Field for an AWC softball doubleheader. Dine arrived in Yuma in the spring of 1970 where he was a member of the AWC family for approximately 27 years. Dine served 10 years as Athletic Director, and then from 1982-1991 as AWC Head Softball Coach. In addition to coaching two NJCAA championship teams, the team earned runner-up status in 1986.
