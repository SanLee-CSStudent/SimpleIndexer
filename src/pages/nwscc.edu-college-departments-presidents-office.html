As Alabama\u2019s first public junior college, NW-SCC prides itself as an educational home for the people of northwest Alabama for more than 57 years. As a comprehensive two-year college, NW-SCC provides academic, career technical and lifelong educational opportunities with academic and workforce education including certificate and degree offerings. There are two campuses; the Shoals campus in Muscle Shoals and the Phil Campbell campus, located in Franklin County. The experienced faculty and dedicated staff are committed to helping you succeed in all aspects of life. I believe in a student-centered approach and hope you take advantage of many free college services that include financial aid, tutoring, academic advising, career and transfer counseling, and job-seeking assistance. No matter your dreams or ambitions, NW-SCC wants to help you achieve them. I hope you will find a link to the most recent NW-SCC annual report. It highlights the College\u2019s commitment to the community, new innovative programs, and focus on work-based learning programs that transition students directly into the workforce while they are still taking classes on campus.
