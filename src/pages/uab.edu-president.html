But those reactions did not deter him. Instead, Dr. Volker was powered by the will to grow our fledgling university into an internationally renowned leader in education, research and scholarship, and patient care. Over the years, countless students, alumni, employees, and community supporters have shared that belief that we can build a brighter future for Birmingham, Alabama, and the world. Their efforts laid the foundation for five decades of growth and success far beyond what anyone could have imagined. Breakthroughs made at UAB have had a global impact. To name just a few examples, we have pioneered game-changing treatments for cancer, diabetes, HIV, cystic fibrosis, and many other diseases. We engineered the fiber-optic endoscope, four-handed dentistry, and materials for lighter, stronger military gear. Locations in Antarctica\u2014and on Mars\u2014bear the names of UAB researchers to honor their contributions to marine biology and physics. Using satellite imaging, we have revealed thousands of buried pyramids in Egypt and ancient settlements around the world. And we have pioneered software and partnered with the FBI to catch cybercriminals. As extraordinary as our past is, however, our future is even more promising. We have become one of the nation\u2019s most vibrant, diverse, and sustainable campuses. Here you will discover students and faculty redefining treatment through precision medicine, bridging gaps in education and health care, launching high-tech start-ups to boost our economy, and pursuing innovations in the arts, engineering, science, and many other fields. Once again, we share a bold vision\u2014and the willpower to bring it to life. I invite you to join us as we begin UAB\u2019s next 50 years.
