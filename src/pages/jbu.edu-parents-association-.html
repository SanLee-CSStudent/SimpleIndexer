How the Parents Association Operates Members of the Association include all parents and guardians of current JBU students. The JBU Parent Association Council is a volunteer-based group of current parents who represent the concerns, interests, and views of parents to the University. They are committed to participating in the life of the University not only through prayer and financial support, but by volunteering to work events sponsored by JBU Parent Association, and hosting at a minimum of one parent event in their state or city per semester. The purpose of the Parent Association Council is: To oversee the fulfillment of the purpose of the Parents Association. In particular, to foster communication between the University and current parents in an effort to provide a positive college experience for both JBU students and families. The council is advisory to the University and works through the office of Alumni & Parent Engagement. Membership is by appointment. The officers and the Director of Alumni & Parent Engagement appoint a maximum of 28 members. Married couples are encouraged to serve together. Membership should reflect the diversity of the student body (geographic and class year). Members need to be willing to participate in the activities of the council at their own expense. Potential council members may be recommended to the Director of Alumni & Parent Engagement by current parents, or members of JBU staff and administration. In addition, if a parent is interested in serving he or she may contact JBU Alumni & Parent Relations at 1-888-JBU-ALUM, parents@jbu.edu, or fill out and submit the Parent Association Council application.
