We acknowledge the Alaska Native nations upon whose ancestral lands our six campuses reside. In Fairbanks, our Troth Yeddha\u2019 Campus is located on the ancestral lands of the Dena people of the lower Tanana River. We are proud to be federally designated as an Alaska Native Serving Institution, with over 20 percent of our student body being Alaska Native and\/or American Indian. Since 1965, we have worked to develop and implement a broad array of Alaska Native and Indigenous programs aimed at supporting Alaska Native and Indigenous student success and focused on advancing the field of Indigenous studies. With a growing number of Indigenous scholars and researchers serving among our faculty and staff, we are a premier global destination for Alaska Native and Indigenous students. Whether you are interested in Indigenous arts, language revitalization or knowledge systems, or simply want to attend a world-class research university that embraces Indigenous values and identity, you will find a home at the Troth Yeddha\u2019 Campus or one of our other community campuses. Please explore the academic degree and job training programs on this website and reach out to us to discuss how you can grow into your full potential as a scholar and leader at UAF.

Our goal is to raise $25 million to complete the Troth Yeddha' Legacy in two phases. In phase one, we will raise $5 million to create the Troth Yeddha' Park and design the Indigenous studies center as part of our centennial celebrations in 2017. Phase two will build the Indigenous studies center.
