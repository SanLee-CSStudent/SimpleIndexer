Please call 870-391-3368 or come to the LRC Information Desk. Plagiarism To intentionally take and use as one\u2019s own the ideas, writing, or research of another individual. One way to think about this is: don\u2019t copy and paste anything from another resource into your paper without referencing it. The Citation Machine is located on the Office 365 Students site under the Library tab. Cheating Intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise. Unauthorized Collaboration Unauthorized collaboration is defined as working with others on assignments or exams without the instructor\u2019s permission. This hinders the instructor\u2019s ability to assess learning. Before borrowing someone\u2019s notes, ideas, old tests or essays, consult your class syllabus and have a conversation with your instructor directly to ensure you understand his or her expectations.

Research Help LRC Staff members are available to show different resources and methods used to conduct research and to help students use research tools.
