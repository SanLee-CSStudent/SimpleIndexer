International students are responsible for securing private housing and paying out-of-state tuition. There is no housing on the Northeast Alabama Community College campus, and housing within walking distance is very limited. This makes it very difficult for an international student who has no friends or family in the area. Apartments are available within driving distance. There is no financial aid available for international students. Northeast Alabama Community College accepts international students who have an F-1 visa (see Visa Application Process) and meet the academic, linguistic, and financial requirements outlined below. Once all admissions documents are received by the College, the student\u2019s information will be entered on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) at the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The I-20 will then be printed and distributed to the student so the student can obtain an F-1 student visa at the nearest U.S. consulate of their home country. See Visa application instructions. Students should check with their local U.S. consulate for any special materials required for visa application. For more information visit the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Service webpage. The I-20 will not be issued to part-time or transient international students. To begin the admission procedure, the student can contact Rhiannan Newsome, Admissions Office Assistant, at 256-638-4418 or 256-228-6001 ext. 2224 newsomer@nacc.edu. International Students (First Time-Freshman) must have: A complete Application for Admission in English submitted 60 days before the beginning of the semester. A current and valid passport to verify lawful presence. Official transcripts in English that document graduation from a secondary school that is equivalent to a U.S. high school and transcripts from all colleges and universities previously attended. All domestic transcripts must be mailed directly to Northeast Alabama Community College from the institution attended. Personal copies are not accepted. All foreign transcripts must be evaluated by an approved transcript evaluation service. Northeast recommends that for a discounted rate students use SPANTRAN: The Evaluation Company to request their translated and evaluated international high school and college transcripts. The international student will be responsible for contacting their evaluation company of choice, making arrangements for all fees or requirements that are necessary, and requesting that a copy of the evaluation be mailed to Northeast Alabama Community College. All transcripts must be evaluated not just translated. Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS): The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) measures the ability of nonnative speakers to use and understand English. TOEFL minimum written score of 500 or TOEFL minimum computer-based score of 173 or TOEFL minimum internet-based score of 61 or IELTS minimum score of 5.5 The scores must be mailed directly to the Admissions Office at Northeast. The TOEFL and IELTS Tests are not administered at Northeast. Exceptions (TOEFL not required): A graduate of an U.S. high school Other exemptions may be granted by the Dean of Student Services. A signed and notarized Affidavit of Financial Support declaring that the international applicant or their sponsor will be fully financially responsible and that funds are available for all financial obligations during the enrollment with Northeast. Financial obligations include but are not limited to tuition and fees, books and supplies, living expenses, housing and miscellaneous expenses. The approximate cost per year is $10000 to $28000 depending on the program and the number of semesters you choose. A bank statement or bank letter (on official bank letterhead paper dated within six (6) months of the first date of class attendance) MUST be attached to the Affidavit of Financial Support. All documents must be in English and show amounts in U.S. dollars. Documentation of health insurance which includes repatriation and must be maintained during all terms of enrollment at Northeast. See Insurance Providers. A medical health history form with proof of vaccinations. Payment of I-901 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) Fee. International Students (Transfer Student) must have: Any international student who has attended an accredited college or university may be considered for admission as a transfer student. Transfer students must comply with all the items listed under International Students (First Time-Freshman) and must also provide the following: Official transcripts from all previously attended colleges and universities mailed directly to Northeast Alabama Community College. Provide a Transfer Clearance Form completed by the student and signed by the appropriate administrator from the college previously attended. This ensures that the student has remained IN-STATUS at the previous college. International Student Guidelines Failure to follow the rules and regulations of the USCIS could result in dismissal and loss of student status. Your International Student Advisor is required to enforce these regulations. Please read them carefully to make sure that you can comply with each one. Records of International Students at Northeast Alabama Community College are maintained on the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) and reported to the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Service (USCIS). To abide by USCIS regulations and Northeast Alabama Community College Policies while an international student, you must do the following: Passport: Keep your Passport valid at all times. To renew an expired passport, you must return to your home country or visit the nearest embassy of your home country. Form I-20: You must have a valid, non-expired Form I-20 at all times to maintain your student status with the USCIS. Students are usually admitted for \u201CDuration of Status.\u201D (\u201CD\\S\u201D is stamped on your I-94 card in your passport.) This status is valid for as long as you are a full-time student until \u201CComplete Studies\u201D date on Item 5 of your I-20. Local Address: If you move, you must notify your International Student Advisor within 10 days of an address change as Northeast is required to inform USCIS. Travel Outside the U.S.: When you leave the United States for a temporary absence, you should take with you your passport, I-94 card, and I-20 form signed on the third page by your International Student Advisor. You ALWAYS need a valid Student (F-1) Visa to re-enter the United States. If your visa has expired, you should include a visit to the U.S. Consulate in your travel plans. Insurance for International Students Like most colleges and universities in the United States, Northeast Alabama Community College requires proof of health insurance policy which includes repatriation for international students. International students must provide evidence of insurance before the I-20 can be issued. The insurance policy must provide for treatment by physicians and hospitals and also medical evacuation and repatriation benefits. The Harbour Group and ISO Health Insurance are two recommended international student insurance providers for you to explore.
