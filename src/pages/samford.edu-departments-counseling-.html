The skills of the counselor involve genuineness, empathy, and respect, creating a safe environment to explore issues. It is designed to explore your personal issues in gaining insight and clarity as well as developing a plan of action for positive change. Confidentiality Protected health information may be disclosed without written permission in situations of imminent danger for the student or others, where it is required by court. Otherwise, given licensing standards for Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC) and Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW), protected student health information (i.e. counseling content) will only be disclosed with the student\u2019s written permission on a Release of Information Form. Only the student can make decisions regarding reporting to State Professional Boards or other agencies regarding their use of Counseling & Wellness. When and if specific protected health information would be shared is discussed with each student during sessions. Mission The mission of Counseling & Wellness is to empower the students of Samford University to realize their academic and personal potential by promoting psychological, social, and spiritual wellness through individual counseling and outreach programming. While Samford\u2019s professional counselors are equipped to integrate and address spiritual aspects of personal growth, the student sets the tone and chooses when and how they would like to include this dimension into their therapeutic work.

Grief and Loss Dealing with intense grief after the loss of a family member, friend, classmate, or relationship can be one of the most difficult experiences to go through, especially when juggling the commitments of college. This resource guide is designed to help you understand the grieving process and provide support as you balance your personal needs and responsibilities. Adapted from Managing Grief Meeting Your Immediate Needs When first faced with the news of loss, it is not unusual to feel overwhelmed, numb, in denial, or angry. In the first hours, it may be beneficial to reach out to your support system and avoid making important decisions. Once the initial wave of emotion has passed, here are some potential next steps towards meeting your immediate needs: Take Care of Yourself Taking care of your immediate physical and emotional needs are important after receiving the initial news. This may look like allowing yourself to cry, going on a run, or reaching out to family, friends, church pastor, counselor or other supportive people in your life. The way in which you handle grief is your unique experience. There really is no right way to grieve and comparing one\u2019s grief experience to others can delay or interrupt healthy grieving. Over time, self-care may also look like following a routine, delaying major decisions, avoiding drastic life changes, and establishing an emotional outlet such as grief counseling or a hobby that allows you to express what you are feeling. Submit a Bereavement Form and Contact Professors The next step is to identify upcoming assignment due dates in classes that you may need to miss for funeral services or family responsibilities. Contact your academic advisor and professors with the days you will need to miss and discuss plans for completing your assignments. Once you have done this, submit a bereavement form. Bereavement Form Submitting a bereavement form with the necessary information will notify the CARE Team of your loss and prompt them to initiate the University Bereavement Policy on your behalf. The policy allows for up to five consecutive days of missed class for travel to services or family gatherings related to your loss. You will still be responsible for making up any missed assignments and making arrangements with professors regarding the details, but the policy does protect you from being penalized for the absences and initiates official communication to your professors. What Grief Might Look Like for You Recognize your loss: After a significant loss, you may be numb for a while. Being numb allows us to accept the loss a little at a time. It is important to acknowledge the loss and the pain. Be with the pain: You are hurting. Admit it. Feeling the pain after a loss is a normal part of living and loving. Denying the loss does not lessen the pain, it prolongs the suffering. Accept all of your feelings, even the feelings you don\u2019t like: Fear, anger, guilt, sadness, depression, despair, heartbreak, and an overwhelming feeling of disorganization are characteristic reactions to a significant loss. Avoiding naming and feeling our feelings, will mean our feelings will be expressed in unexpected ways. It is okay to feel anger: Everyone feels angry at a significant loss. Channel it wisely and it will go away as you heal. Walk, run, and exercise. If you find yourself more irritable, journal and explore what your anger is about. Anger is also a way for some people to avoid feeling the more vulnerable feeling of sadness. You are vulnerable, be gentle with yourself: Invite help only from people who you know will be gentle with your feelings and can accept all of your feelings. You are not alone, seek comfort as you need it: Although you feel alone and grieving is an individual process, you are not alone. Grieving is a sad part of life everyone experiences. Accept support from others. Let them know what they can do to help. Do not expect comfort from a grieving partner as your partner may not be able to give when you need due to their own grief. Weekends and holidays can be very hard, make plans with others. Suicidal thoughts can be a symptom of your pain: Sometimes people feel survivor\u2019s guilt or they wish they had died instead of their loved one. If your thoughts of dying persist and you feel they are out of control, SEEK HELP AT ONCE by going to your local emergency room, calling Suicide Hotline at 888-273-8255 or Birmingham Crisis Center at 205-323-7777. Healing can be unpredictable and uncomfortable: Healing occurs in phases where you move in and out of different feelings. Remind yourself that you can get through this. If it feels like you have been there long enough, remember, there is no way around grieving. You can only accept where you are in each moment and continue on your journey. Heal at your own pace: Never compare yourself to another grieving person. Each of us has our own timing. Expect relapses: There will always be certain things that trigger sadness again. Surges of strong emotions of grief and sadness are normal and healthy. Keep a journal: Putting your thoughts and feelings on paper is a good way to get them out and understand them. Do your mourning now: allow yourself to be with your pain--it will pass sooner. Postponed grief will return later. Tips for Coping Physical exercise along with relaxation will improve sleep and concentration. Keep a journal: write through your sleeplessness and change the ending of your nightmares. Talk to people: talk is one of the most healing activities. It is how we let go of stress. Give yourself permission to feel rotten and share your feeling with others. Give yourself permission to have moments of happiness or escape. Spend time with others. Resist the temptation to isolate. Get plenty of rest and eat regular meals even if you don\u2019t feel like it. Seeking Help Processing the loss of a loved one is difficult and feeling a flood of emotions is expected. If your grief is stopping you from taking care of your needs such as difficulty completing assignments, following through with commitments or engaging in self-destructive behaviors, it is time to seek professional help. The following resources can provide you with support as you navigate your pain. On-campus Resources Counseling & Wellness Programs 205-726-4083 counseling@samford.edu Samford CARES 205-726-2083 How to Help a Friend Struggling with Grief If a friend has experienced the death of a loved one, here are some tips for providing thoughtful and loving support. Do Acknowledgment - Acknowledge the loss happened. While you want to be mindful of how your friend may respond to what you say, it is better to acknowledge the loss than to ignore it. Acceptance - Accept what they say and reassure them that it is okay for them to react to what has happened to them. Service - Show them you care through acts of services. Sometimes, it can become difficult to take care of chores, going to class, and meeting their physical needs. Ask your friend how you can help. Silence - Let them be silent if it looks like they don\u2019t want to talk. It can be difficult to talk about the pain if they are not ready. Follow up - Check in with a phone call, text, or visit to show them you are thinking about them and want to know how they are doing. Mindfulness - Be mindful of how and when to share Scripture or other religious messages with your friend. Ask yourself: will this be encouraging and hope-giving, will there be a better moment to share this, or can I show God\u2019s love and care for my friend in another, tangible way? Avoid Offering advice Using clich?s Acting as if nothing happened or expect them to \u201Cbe normal\u201D Grieving the Death of a Samford Student Experiencing the death of a close-friend or classmate can be a traumatic and painful experience. In the event that a Samford student loses their life, there is help available. Reach out to the resources listed in this guide, friends, family, professors, and community members for support.
