Wheeler, a junior double-majoring in political science and psychology with a pre-law concentration, is participating in an internship with the City Attorney for her hometown, Cabot, Ark. Wheeler learned about the internship this semester, and with a little help, made the right moves to get a foot in the door for the summer. \u201CI got the internship with the help of my dad. He is a department head for the city,\u201D Wheeler said. \u201CSo, when I was looking for an internship, I asked him if he knew any lawyers that would want an intern.\u201D She continued, \u201CHe got me in contact with the City Attorney and then I had a, more informal, meeting with him and the paralegal that also works for the city.\u201D Wheeler said that a majority of the work she will be doing includes filling out and filing paperwork, however, she has also been given an enticing opportunity for any pre-law student: the chance to attend court. \u201CMy first day on the internship was actually a court day, which is by far the most chaotic part of the internship.\u201D Wheeler said she wasn\u2019t as nervous or as on-edge as she would have been without the previous knowledge she had gained throughout her classes at Lyon. \u201CI had previously taken Intro to Legal Studies. In that class, we did a mock trial in a courthouse in Batesville,\u201D Wheeler said. \u201CSo, having that experience of being in a courthouse and going through the motions of reading cases and such really helped get me familiarized and comfortable with the environment.\u201D Classrooms and mock trials can only take students so far, which is why Wheeler is ready for court to be in session. \u201CI am mostly excited about getting to experience what being an attorney looks like, '' Wheeler said. \u201CI am planning on going to law school after Lyon, so I think that being able to experience the day-to-day atmosphere of a profession like this will be very valuable!\u201D Wheeler expressed how important she felt it is to take away some basic skills and knowledge in the legal field before fully dedicating the next several years of her life pursuing a career in law. \u201CI am very grateful for the opportunity to be able to have an internship for a career that I could see myself doing. Moreso, I am grateful for the opportunity to see if the legal field is something that I actually want to do. I think this is a good time to confirm what I want to do in the future.\u201D Wheeler hopes to utilize the knowledge she learns this summer to aid her in the next five years as she pursues a Juris Doctor degree. internship ?
