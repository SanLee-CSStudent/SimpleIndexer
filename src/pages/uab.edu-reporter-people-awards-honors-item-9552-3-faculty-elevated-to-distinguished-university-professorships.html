The rank of Distinguished Professor is a campuswide appointment that recognizes international accomplishments to confer richly deserved prestige and honor on those selected to receive this designation. The rank of University Professor is a campuswide appointment primarily prestigious in a specific discipline; it confers an academic rank that transcends departmental and disciplinary lines and grants recipients the greatest latitude in teaching, writing, and scholarly research.
