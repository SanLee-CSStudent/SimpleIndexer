In-Person Research Resumption of Research Operations Update: March 24, 2021 Previously published guidance on the resumption of laboratory, non-Human Subjects Research is now suspended. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present complex challenges and events may transpire that could require a return to more restrictive guidance. Effective March 24, 2021 the following guidance will be in effect: Masks are required at all times in the laboratory, research spaces, and elsewhere on campus. Some laboratories may require gloves or other protective equipment as well. Efforts should be made to keep laboratory personnel density as low as practical, and social distancing should be practiced when possible. Hand hygiene and disinfecting workspaces are strongly encouraged at all times. Those who work in shared space or use shared equipment must jointly develop and implement a plan for hygiene maintenance. Guidance for Human Subjects Research (pdf) dated March 17, 2021 is current and the recommendations should be followed. Students in health care clinical rotations or other placements must have one COVID-19 vaccination shot by December 6, 2021, if the students will be at a UAB Health System facility or at any third party that is subject to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service requirements. Students must be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022. There are exemptions available on medical, disability, or religious grounds which students can apply for through this Student Health Services website. IMPORTANT: Students who will be conducting undergraduate research with a mentor must first register with our office: Get signature from mentor\/principle investigator on the confirmation form to confirm placement. Upload signed placement to registration form and complete the rest of the form. Virtual Research Undergraduate research can still be completed online with a mentor. Options include: Literature reviews Data analysis Surveys Journal book clubs Book and article reviews Additionally, there are research courses offered online or that do not require in person contact. Talk to your research mentors about alternatives. Additional Prerequisites All students must complete the CITI training to start research. If you are going to do research in the School of Medicine you must also take the pre-requisite PSDO 200 Introduction to Research course (1 credit hour).
