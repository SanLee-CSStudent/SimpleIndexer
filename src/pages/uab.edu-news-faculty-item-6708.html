What will her wish be? Written by Erin Allweiss: 202.446.8265 or erin@thenumber29.com. TED has announced Sarah Parcak as the winner of the 2016 TED Prize. Often described as the modern day Indiana Jones, Parcak uses infrared imagery from satellites to uncover ancient archaeological sites. A pioneer of space archaeology, she has earned acclaim for being among the first to apply satellite imaging to locate archaeological sites in Egypt. Each year TED, the nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading, awards the TED Prize to one exceptional individual and gives them the chance to conceive and launch a high-impact project\u2014\u201Ca wish\u201D offered to them without restriction. Parcak will receive $1 million from TED to launch her wish, and the opportunity to call on TED\u2019s global community of innovators, entrepreneurs, and TEDx organizers to participate in fulfilling the wish. Parcak is the first TED Fellow to receive the prestigious prize in its eleven-year history. A professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham \u2014 where she founded the Laboratory for Global Observation \u2014 and a National Geographic Fellow, Parcak gained international attention for satellite mapping all of Egypt and unearthing 17 potential unknown pyramids (adding to the 138 known ones), 1,000 tombs and 3,100 settlements. She and her team have since uncovered thousands of additional ancient sites across Europe, the Mediterranean, and the North Atlantic, and also have used satellite technology to map extensive looting in post-Revolution Egypt. Between now and the 2016 TED Conference (Feb 15-19 in Vancouver, BC), Parcak will work with TED to share an audacious wish that builds on her success \u2013 sharing her vision live from the TED stage on February 16. The talk will be broadcast for free via tedlive.ted.com\/webcasts\/2016. \u201CTED is committed to the ancient tradition of storytelling, and making it relevant to a modern, global audience. Sarah\u2019s work honors that \u2014 she uses 21st century technology to make the world\u2019s ancient, invisible history visible once again,\u201D said TED Prize Director Anna Verghese. \u201CAt a moment when so many ancient sites are under threat \u2013 and being destroyed \u2013 it feels particularly poignant that we are awarding the TED Prize to a brilliant mind, committed to finding, sharing and protecting these gems.\u201D \u201CI am honored to receive the TED Prize, but it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about our field \u2013 and the thousands of men and women around the world, particularly in the Middle East, who are defending and protecting sites,\u201D said Parcak. \u201CThe last four and half years have been horrific for archaeology. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time, as have many of my colleagues, looking at the destruction. I am committed to using this Prize to engage the world in finding and protecting these global sites.\u201D Parcak was introduced to aerial photography through her grandfather\u2019s use of it in his forestry work. While pursuing Egyptology at Yale, she took a remote sensing class with his work in mind and began to wonder if modern technology could also be applied to archaeology. While a Ph.D. candidate at Cambridge University, Parcak developed a technique for processing satellite data that helped her detect 132 undiscovered sites in Egypt. About the TED Prize The first TED Prize was awarded in 2005, born out of the TED Conference and a vision by the world's leading entrepreneurs, innovators, and entertainers to launch a global project that marries the recipient\u2019s \u201Cwish\u201D with TED\u2019s global community. The original prize:$100,000and the TED community's range of talent and expertise. What began as an unparalleled experiment to leverage the resources of the TED community has evolved into a $1 million award and an ambitious effort to spur global-scale change. From Bono's the ONE Campaign ('05 recipient) to Jamie Oliver 's Food Revolution ('10) to JR's Inside Out Project ('11), Sugata Mitra\u2019s School in a Cloud (\u201913), Charmian Gooch\u2019s call to eliminate anonymous corporations (\u201914), and StoryCorps Founder Dave Isay\u2019s (\u201915) wish to take the platform global, the TED Prize has helped to combat poverty, take on religious intolerance, improve global health, tackle child obesity, advance education, and inspire art around the world. This is the first year TED Prize nominations for the $1 million award will be on a rolling basis. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
