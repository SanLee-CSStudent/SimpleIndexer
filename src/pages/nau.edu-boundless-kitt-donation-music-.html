Michael and Karen Kitt aren\u2019t from northern Arizona. Neither of them attended NAU. Neither is a musician. So why did the couple choose the NAU School of Music as the recipient of an overwhelmingly generous gift? The answer is threefold: avid intellectual curiosity, a deep appreciation for creative expression, and an insatiable zest for life. The Kitts\u2019 gift is the largest donation the College of Arts and Letters (CAL) has ever received. In appreciation of the Kitts\u2019 sizable gift to CAL\u2019s School of Music, the department has been officially renamed the Kitt School of Music. Counterpoint (the simultaneous sound of two or more melodies)* Set against the stories of their lives, the Kitts\u2019 beneficence makes perfect sense. Michael and Karen both grew up and went to college in New York. Both developed a passion for music in childhood. Karen\u2019s family encouraged her when she wanted to play the violin in elementary and middle school. In college, her roommate was a piano major. Mike grew up in a musical family. \u201CI was the one who had no musical talent,\u201D he quips. After college\u2014they are both first-generation college graduates, Mike with degrees in chemistry and business management, and Karen in political science\u2014they each led successful professional lives in Manhattan. Karen was 25 years into an IT career at Verizon when a reorganization effort gave her the chance for early retirement. \u201CSo at the age of 46 and a half they said \u2018Karen, would you like to retire with full pension, healthcare, dental care, telephone discounts?\u2019 I said, \u2018Where do I sign?\u2019\u201D Around the same time, she started dating and then married her neighbor, Mike. From the beginning, music was integral to their life together. \u201CMusic, a love of classical music, was something we both developed before we met,\u201D Mike says. \u201CMusic was something we had in common.\u201D The couple took full advantage of the cultural riches of Manhattan, attending numerous concerts at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and many other venues. Soon after they married, Mike retired from a 30-year career in strategic planning at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. They wasted no time launching into a lifetime of adventures. The Kitts traveled\u2026a lot. They bought a motor home and toured the United States and Canada, driving 73,000 miles over the course of 11 years\u2014enough to circle the globe nearly three times. They\u2019ve been to every National Park west of the Mississippi. Mike\u2019s lifelong passion for astronomy resulted in many trips to Flagstaff\u2019s Lowell Observatory. They met every experience with curiosity and enthusiasm. And at every step along the way, there was music. Allargando (gradually decreasing in tempo and broadening in manner)* In December 2012, after living in the Catskill Mountains in southeastern New York and Palm Desert, California, they moved to Flagstaff full-time. A quiet retirement was never a consideration. Both Karen and Mike jumped feet first into enjoying and serving in the community. \u201CIt\u2019s just our natural inclination to get involved,\u201D Mike says. They formed relationships with the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra, the Museum of Northern Arizona, The Arboretum, and other groups around town, continuing their association with Lowell Observatory. \u201CWhen we came to Flagstaff, NAU wasn\u2019t even on our radar,\u201D says Mike. In the beginning, NAU was just a place to take nice walks. But soon, the couple\u2019s passion for music drew them to campus for more than just walks. \u201CWe\u2019ve always enjoyed music,\u201D Mike says. \u201CIt was very natural for us to come to NAU for some performances. And we were quite impressed. We realized that there\u2019s a lot of unrealized potential there.\u201D That potential is a product of NAU\u2019s ability to attract the best and brightest. Mike calls it \u201Cthe Flagstaff effect.\u201D He adds, \u201Cthere are people who could go to almost any university, but they\u2019re looking at quality of life and the kind of lifestyle and general atmosphere that NAU offers. And so we attract good people, whether it\u2019s faculty or students. Really, really high quality.\u201D Accelerando (a gradually increasing tempo)* The Kitts made some initial donations to the music department. Over the years, their support deepened as they watched the talented faculty take gifted but untested students and form them into accomplished musicians. They also saw that the department was underresourced. So their philanthropy increased, and in 2019, they were the principal backers of the new Kitt Recital Hall. The vision, says Kitt School of Music Director Eric Lenz, went beyond providing a quality space for students. \u201CMichael and Karen consider music a powerful force capable of bridging our university with the community and region.\u201D From the moment it opened, the facility was enthusiastically embraced by the Lumberjack community and music lovers across northern Arizona and beyond. Ye Lynn Han, a 2019 Vocal Performance graduate, was one of the first to sing there. \u201CThe new Kitt Recital Hall, that\u2019s a game-changer,\u201D he says. \u201CThe acoustics\u2014you feel like a professional.\u201D The hall won national awards for its stunning design and outstanding acoustics. \u201CThat\u2019s what we wanted,\u201D says Mike. \u201CWe wanted it to be something that would inspire performers and audiences at the same time.\u201D For the Kitts, the quality of the new facility and the depth of its impact on the music program galvanized them to expand their vision. \u201COnce we saw what the recital hall did, it was an easy, easy step to the next level.\u201D Magnum opus (the greatest achievement of an artist)** The next level means a significant donation and a new name for the school. The terms of the donation allow Kitt School of Music faculty and administration to create the academic unit of their dreams. \u201CIt\u2019s really up to the school to figure out its vision,\u201D says Mike. \u201CBecause what we might want is not necessarily what suits them best academically. We\u2019ve basically said to the leadership, \u2018Think big. Think about all the things you\u2019ve wanted to do for years and didn\u2019t have the resources to do.\u2019\u201D Lenz says the Kitts\u2019 donation will have a profound impact on the school because of its size and flexibility. \u201CWe are incredibly excited that the gift has been written in a way that allows the director and faculty to decide collaboratively how funds are committed,\u201D Lenz says. \u201CThe open-ended nature of the Kitt donation will allow us to evolve over the years in order to best serve successive generations of musicians.\u201D In the words of President Jos? Luis Cruz Rivera, \u201CThe NAU family is proud to recognize the Kitts as Lumberjacks for life. Mike and Karen\u2019s foresight and generosity have had a transformative impact on NAU faculty, students, and the Flagstaff community, elevating NAU\u2019s prestige in Arizona and the region for excellence in the musical arts.\u201D Finale (the closing section of a musical composition)* The Kitts hope that their philanthropy will inspire others to give across campus. \u201CWe\u2019d like to serve as an example to others,\u201D they both say. \u201CWe hope the university can use this as a catalyst for engaging other potential donors. There are many other worthy programs that could benefit from similar support.\u201D As for the Kitt School of Music, the Kitts can\u2019t wait to see the school compose a bright future, cementing the couple\u2019s legacy at NAU. *musicaldictionary.com **merriam-webster.com SHARE YOUR STORY What goals have you crushed?
