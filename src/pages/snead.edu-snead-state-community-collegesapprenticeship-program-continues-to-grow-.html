The program also includes a national occupational credential from the Alabama Office of Apprenticeship. \u201CThis is a critical program. It\u2019s very important, and we\u2019re proud to see our students represent the College and the program well with our business and industry partners,\u201D said Snead State President Dr. Joe Whitmore. \u201CWe\u2019re working hard to grow our career and technical programs because we know our workforce is critical for our community.\u201D Since the Registered Apprenticeship Program began, Snead State has placed 11 apprenticeships within four industry partners. \u201CWe appreciate the support from our industry partnerships,\u201D said Snead State Director of Workforce Development Teresa Walker. \u201CThey help us with letters of support and with anything we ask to grow our programs and provide opportunities for our students. The apprenticeships are a good way for the students to earn while they learn and a great way for them to pay for their college education. We are happy to provide these connections for them while pairing our industries with quality employees.\u201D Snead State students recently signed agreements with the College\u2019s Registered Apprenticeship Program to work with industry partner Mueller.
