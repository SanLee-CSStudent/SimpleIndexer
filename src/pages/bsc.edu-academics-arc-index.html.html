The Academic Resource Center, or ARC, provides support to the entire campus community with the goal of advancing student success. Through ARC subject-specific tutoring, students can access free specialized tutoring across the curriculum in over 23 subjects and learn to master the skills and habits required for academic excellence. At ARC, we: Use peer tutors and one-on-one-assistance to promote collaborative learning in Business, Humanities, Languages, Sciences, and Social Sciences. Offer pre-professional opportunities and valuable work experience for upperclassmen who act as paid tutors. Strive to make services and assistance accessible to a variety of learners. Drop-In vs. Appointments When you drop-in you are seeking assistance without an appointment on the subject-specific channel at the time listed on the schedule and will receive aid from the tutors online at that time. The drop-in schedule with days, times, subjects, tutors, and links to the channels can be found below. An appointment is made directly with a tutor for a date and time that works for both tutee and tutor. To make appointments reach out to tutors directly by email or on Teams and arrangements will be made. The ARC tutor's names, subject information, and drop-in availability can be found below.
