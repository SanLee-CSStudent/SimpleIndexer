The winner will be recognized at the Faculty Awards Ceremony held on November 9, 2021 at the Gogue Performing Arts Center. 2021 Award for Excellence in Faculty Outreach Recipient: Adit Singh Godbold Endowed Chair Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Samuel Ginn College of Engineering For the past four decades, Singh has used his expertise to train engineers in integrated circuit design and testing. His initial effort is focused on updating practicing engineers on new subjects, but as the semiconductor technology changed, he presented advanced new research ideas that had significant commercial potential. Companies such as IBM, Intel, National Semiconductor and Qualcomm have benefited from his in-house tutorials and conference presentations, outreach and engaged continuing education and training. Thousands of engineers throughout Asia, Europe and the U.S. have attended Singh's tutorials.
