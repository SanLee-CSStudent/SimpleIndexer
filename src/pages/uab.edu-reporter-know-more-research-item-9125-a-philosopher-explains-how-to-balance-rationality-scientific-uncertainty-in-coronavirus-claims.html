This is especially true during a pandemic in which scientists work around the clock to make cutting-edge discoveries, media outlets provide updates 24\/7 and social media circulates information, accurate or otherwise, at breakneck speed. In his book, \u201CUncertainty: How It Makes Science Advance,\u201D published this past year by Oxford University Press, McCain argues that uncertainty can fuel scientific endeavors, leading to more and better discoveries and understanding. But what happens when misinterpretations of that uncertainty go public? Combatting the consequences of misunderstanding the realities of scientific discoveries is tricky, McCain says, but it can be done. \u201CIt\u2019s common for people to think of science or scientific knowledge as something that\u2019s known with certainty,\u201D he explained. \u201CSo, we often hear things like \u2018science has proven that\u2026\u2019 or \u2018science says this, so this is certain.\u2019 \u201CRelatedly, we see people being skeptical of calling something science or accepting something as scientific knowledge when the fact in question isn\u2019t known with certainty. This, I think, is a misunderstanding of both the nature of science and the relationship between knowledge and certainty.\u201D Kevin McCain, Ph.D., associate professor of philosophyConsider the gray areas McCain says understanding that relationship is rooted in understanding two ideas of certainty. Beware the pitfall of unwarranted psychological certainty, he warns \u2014 being absolutely sure that something is true without sufficient evidence. Psychological certainty, which simply has to do with how firmly someone believes, isn\u2019t the sort of certainty that is relevant for determining whether something counts as scientific knowledge, he says, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t widespread. \u201CIt\u2019s not uncommon to encounter people being absolutely certain that something is true, despite knowing very little about the topic and having very little relevant information,\u201D he said. \u201CPsychological certainty is simply a matter of one\u2019s strength of conviction.\u201D For example, McCain says someone might be psychologically certain that they are immune to COVID-19 because their horoscope predicted a year of good health. \u201CThis is a clear case where the person\u2019s level of confidence in a claim is out of touch with the evidence they have,\u201D he continued. The mirror image of psychological certainty is what McCain refers to as epistemic certainty \u2014 this type of certainty is the upper limit of evidential support. And, it is evidence and evidential support relations that inform knowledge and science, he says. \u201CTo be epistemically certain of some fact requires having evidence such that there\u2019s absolutely no possible way you could be wrong \u2014 and possible here is meant in the broadest sense of the term.\u201D Understanding epistemic certainty requires accepting the existence of a gray area. Did you really write that email, he asks? Did you really read the recipient\u2019s reply? After all, he says, you can\u2019t be epistemically certain \u2014 \u201Cthere\u2019s a miniscule chance you\u2019re having a hallucination or something even crazier,\u201D he posits. But it\u2019s obvious that you know you wrote the email, and you know you read the reply. So what does that mean? Essentially, it means that epistemic certainty can\u2019t be required for knowledge, even though most people think exactly the opposite. A big piece of the puzzle is implementing rationality \u2014 matching our level of psychological certainty to our epistemic certainty. \u201CWe can know things without being epistemically certain \u2014 this is true in ordinary life, and it\u2019s true in science,\u201D McCain said. \u201COften people think science gives us epistemic certainty, which is a mistake, because we can\u2019t have that kind of certainty when it comes to pretty much any fact about the world around us.\u201D Therein lies the rub, he continues: \u201CWhen someone learns that a particular scientific claim isn\u2019t epistemically certain \u2014 which is true of all scientific claims \u2014 they might question whether it\u2019s really science at all or think that it doesn\u2019t need to be taken seriously, and so on.\u201D Take the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, for example. When COVID-19 first came to the United States, many people chose to ignore warnings and failed to engage in proper social distancing \u2014 think the spring-breakers that made national news, McCain says. They were likely interpreting uncertainty in data about risk and contraction to mean that \u201Cthe coronavirus wasn\u2019t something that needed to be taken seriously.\u201D This is a common mistake, he warns. \u201CThis is the sort of mistake that people make when they tend to expect certainty from science, and so fail to appreciate that legitimate science always has uncertainties,\u201D McCain said. \u201CPeople who make this mistake tend to think that if a model or scientific finding is uncertain, it\u2019s not really science.\u201D \u201CFor non-scientists like myself, I think the thing to do is listen carefully to what the experts are telling us and make informed decisions based upon that evidence.\u201D But be careful of the pendulum swing, he says: Overlooking uncertainty and a lack of evidence in favor of blind belief is not the answer, either. \u201CThere are people who are downplaying uncertainties when it comes to potential treatments for those infected with the virus,\u201D he said. \u201CSome are taking anecdotal evidence from a few recoveries to be rock-solid evidence of the effectiveness of particular treatments.\u201D An example of this, McCain continues, is the rash of people who, hoping to prevent contracting COVID-19, ingested or injected disinfectants, despite the \u201Ctremendous evidence that drinking bleach and injecting Lysol are horrible ideas.\u201D Another example might be someone drinking several glasses of orange juice the day after being diagnosed with coronavirus and recovering within a few days \u2014 some might think drinking orange juice can have an effect on the virus itself. In his book, \u201CUncertainty: How It Makes Science Advance,\u201D published this past year by Oxford University Press, McCain argues that uncertainty can fuel scientific endeavors, leading to more and better discoveries and understanding.\u201COf course, this overlooks legitimate uncertainties,\u201D McCain said. \u201CDid this person really have COVID-19 and recover at all? Did the orange juice have anything to do with it? The fact that one person drank orange juice and recovered quickly \u2014 granting their story is legitimate \u2014 gives us very little evidence that orange juice helps fight COVID-19. \u201CUnfortunately, people will often jump at such anecdotal evidence and take it to be strong support.\u201D Where scientists step in Those who categorically \u201Cdo\u201D science are the first to recognize the uncertainties that come with it, McCain continues. In most research, the goals are to disprove what is called the null hypothesis, which claims that between two tests, there is no difference, and prove the alternate hypothesis, which says there is. For example: if a small-business owner buys a billboard advertising their burger joint and wonders whether it increased visitor numbers, the null hypothesis would be that the billboard did not bring in additional customers, while the alternate hypothesis would state that it did. The p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Researchers who publish findings include the p-value to reflect the innate uncertainty that comes with scientific research. \u201CIn order for findings to be significant, the p-value has to be very small \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be zero,\u201D McCain said. Practice uncertainty responsibly \u201CScience is uncertain, but I wouldn\u2019t advise betting against it.\u201D It\u2019s important to realize that all the knowledge possessed about the world around us contains at least some level of uncertainty, McCain explains, and that realization can protect against being misled by people who desire to cast doubt wrongly on scientific findings. A big piece of that puzzle, he continues, is implementing rationality \u2014 matching our level of psychological certainty to our epistemic certainty. \u201CWe should be less confident of claims that are weakly supported by the evidence and more confident of claims that are strongly supported,\u201D he explained. While no person, scientist or otherwise, can claim 100% epistemic certainty about pretty much anything, we have much stronger evidence about some things than others, he continues. For example, there is good evidence to support the idea that social distancing can reduce the spread of coronavirus \u2014 \u201Cthe evidence is so good that it would be irrational not to believe it helps,\u201D McCain said. \u201CWe can know things despite lacking certainty, and we can definitely act rationally by accepting well-supported findings,\u201D McCain said. \u201CRecognizing that science is uncertain helps us avoid being led astray when someone points out the uncertainties in particular scientific findings. \u201CWe can know things despite lacking certainty, and we can definitely act rationally by accepting well-supported findings. Recognizing that science is uncertain helps us avoid being led astray when someone points out the uncertainties in particular scientific findings.\u201D \u201CFor instance, it\u2019s not certain that if I walk out in front of a moving bus that I\u2019ll be struck and severely injured or killed \u2014 after all, some people hit by buses are unharmed. However, the rational decision is clearly to not walk in front of a moving bus.\u201D But uncertainty about social distancing\u2019s efficacy can be exacerbated by other questions surrounding coronavirus: who and how many people are infected by or carrying the virus, how to balance social distancing with its costs, economic and otherwise, and the efficacy of current testing solutions. Again, McCain says taking personal responsibility to seek out well-supported findings touted by infectious disease experts and epidemiologists is the best way to combat uncertainty. \u201CWe can know things without being epistemically certain \u2014 this is true in ordinary life, and it\u2019s true in science.\u201D \u201CFor non-scientists like myself, I think the thing to do is listen carefully to what the experts are telling us and make informed decisions based upon that evidence,\u201D he explained. \u201CWe avoid believing, and hopefully acting, irresponsibly by getting evidence from trusted sources and remembering that scientific experts are often aware of evidence the average person isn\u2019t and are better at evaluating evidence than the average person, so their testimony itself is strong evidence. \u201CAt the end of the day, will we be able to be certain that we\u2019re making the best choice? No, because as I mentioned, even the best science is epistemically uncertain, but that doesn\u2019t make it untrustworthy. Going with the best scientific evidence available is definitely the rational way for us to proceed. \u201CAfter all, science is uncertain, but I wouldn\u2019t advise betting against it.\u201D Published in Research & Scholarship back to top Research & Scholarship How UAB researchers keep major studies moving in a pandemic Five faculty who are principal investigators of major cohort studies explain how COVID-19 forced them to rethink and respond \u2014 and how their projects are contributing to the fight. posted a while back 5085 views Research & Scholarship CAS faculty, staff collect 3 state arts council grants Kerry Madden-Lunsford, Stacey Holloway and Melissa Yes each were awarded a $5,000 fellowship to further their work and research. posted a while back 1948 views Research & Scholarship 2 CAS faculty receive Fulbright-Nehru Scholar awards for work in India Social Work\u2019s Colleen Fisher will examine microfinance as a way to alleviate poverty among vulnerable women in low-resource countries, and Art and Art History Associate Professor Cathleen Cummings will study and map temples from the Bhosle dynasty of Nagpur, India. posted a while back 2539 views Research & Scholarship New resource can assist faculty with copyright, publishing questions The Office of Scholarly Communication can offer guidance about publishing agreements, copyright guidelines, Open Access publishing and more. posted a while back 2451 views Research & Scholarship New African American historical collections are \u2018a tremendous asset\u2019 for UAB Libraries New primary-source collections related to African American history and culture will provide a deeper understanding of Black history and its central place in the Birmingham community and beyond. posted a while back 3124 views Research & Scholarship New agreement to facilitate open access publishing UAB Libraries entered a transformative \u201CRead & Publish\u201D agreement with Cambridge University Press and also will add approximately 350 new journal titles to its collection. posted a while back 2948 views Research & Scholarship Research, training at UAB are improving the lives of America\u2019s heroes Investigators are contributing fresh approaches to homelessness, suicide and other issues facing veterans, while veteran students come to UAB in increasing numbers to prepare for new careers. posted a while back 4971 views Research & Scholarship Interdisciplinary data science workshop moves from San Diego to spare bedrooms, but science continues Learn how UAB bioinformaticist Jake Chen, Ph.D., and computer scientist Da Yan, Ph.D., shifted their venerable gathering online and aided the fight against COVID-19. posted a while back 4208 views Research & Scholarship A philosopher explains how to balance rationality, scientific uncertainty in coronavirus claims Uncertainty can fuel scientific endeavors, leading to more and better discoveries and understanding.
