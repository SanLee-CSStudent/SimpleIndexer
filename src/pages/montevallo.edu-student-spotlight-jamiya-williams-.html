But in the four years she spent at UM, everything for Williams \u2013 also known as Ms. Montevallo \u2013 changed. \u201CBefore I came to college, I was really quiet and shy and didn\u2019t talk to people but being an Orientation Leader and in TRIO, I met really nice people who believed in me,\u201D Williams said. \u201CThey encouraged me to grow and being given so many opportunities, it just became an overall good experience.\u201D Williams, who is a McNair Scholar, became a TRIO peer coach her freshman year in fall 2018. The next year, she became a student worker in the Human Resources Office and an Orientation Leader in spring 2019. She served as an Orientation Leader until fall 2021. \u201CThe TRIO team and Ms. Jenny Bell, who is the director of student life, really helped me by seeing past my shyness and seeing a leader in me,\u201D she said. \u201CShe acted on that by giving me the opportunity to be in Freshman Forum and an Orientation Leader.\u201D The confidence Williams built up serving in those roles went a long way, leading her to seek becoming one of the primary student faces at the University: Ms. Montevallo. She ran for Ms. Montevallo with no slogan and no frills, just on the reputation of her good name and some campaigning. \u201CI didn\u2019t have a slogan. I passed out flyers and buttons and made Instagram posts that just said, \u2018vote Jamiya.\u2019\u201D It worked. When the results came in after voting ended during Falcon Week, she was declared the winner, and served in the role from when she was crowned in February until she graduated in May. \u201CIt\u2019s been amazing. I am so appreciative of the student body believing in me to be the face of the University. I\u2019m still in disbelief honestly and am honored to have the position.\u201D Williams graduated in the spring 2022 commencement. She plans to pursue a Ph.D. in clinical psychology with a specialization in psychological trauma in adolescents. She said she\u2019s fascinated by how trauma greatly impacts the executive cognitive functions of adolescents due to those functions being malleable. She hopes to find ways to help curb that impact. Looking back on her time at UM, she fondly remembers College Night \u2013 she\u2019s on the Gold Side \u2013 and the lifelong friendships she formed from her involvement in it, and is grateful that the greatest gift she\u2019s leaving the University with is belief in herself. \u201CIf I go into the workforce not believing in myself, I would not be much help to my employers. Learning to be able to apply myself has truly affirmed me. I know from my time here that I have a place, and that what I do has validity.\u201D Related Posts Student SpotlightJune 1, 2022 Student Spotlight: Hannah Waki As a California native, senior Hannah Waki moved thousands of miles to find the University she will forever consider home. \u201CI truly cannot put into words the amount of gratitude I have for the University and the people who I have met in my time here,\u201D Waki said. \u201CThe memories, opportunities and relationships I have [\u2026] Read More Press ReleasesFebruary 22, 2022 Student Spotlight: Sydney Hollars University of Montevallo Speech-Language Pathology Master\u2019s Student Sydney Hollars was selected as the University\u2019s first SLP Scholarship Program recipient from Sidekick Therapy Partners.
