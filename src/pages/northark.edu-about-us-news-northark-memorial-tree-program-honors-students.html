At North Arkansas College, our students are family. When one of those family members passes away, the College honors the life of the student through the Northark Memorial Tree Program. When a student dies, a tree is planted on one of Northark\u2019s campuses or somewhere in the student\u2019s hometown to commemorate his or her life. A plaque bearing the student\u2019s name rests under each tree. Northark recently planted a tree at Marshall High School to honor Jackson Harness, a 16-year-old Marshall High School student who was taking concurrent classes at Northark. Harness died in a car accident in December 2021. \"This is a program that we have for lost students who were actively pursuing academic work at the time of their loss,\" said Northark President Dr. Rick Massengale Sr. \"It is our way at Northark to remember those students we lost too soon. The tree is planted so that it may grow and provide shade, protection and rest for those in need as it grows. The tree plaque was made at the College's North Campus by the manufacturing department and memorializes Jackson.\u201D Northark\u2019s tree program began in 2019 after the drowning death of Tanzanian student Allen Buberwa.
