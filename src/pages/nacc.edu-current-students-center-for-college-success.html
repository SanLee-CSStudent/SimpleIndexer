We do not just want our students to \"survive\" college; we want them to thrive in college. This is why we offer many student-support programs, such as free tutoring and success seminars, as well as many opportunities to become involved in student events and clubs. During the Fall and Spring semesters, NACC hosts a Mustang Community Resource Fair. Community agencies from all across Jackson and DeKalb Counties come together to share helpful information with students, faculty, staff, and community members. This event promotes awareness of the many services that are available in the community including food services, clothing resources, housing and shelter, childcare, healthcare, counseling services, senior care, crisis and emergency services, transportation, education, and employment. For more information about local community resources, please visit the Community Resource Directory page. NACC has established a Student Resource Room on campus in the Student Center, Room 103. Equipped with a microwave, refrigerator, and an open pantry, this room is designated to be a free resource for NACC students. The Student Resource Room is also stocked with \u201Cgrab and go\u201D food items, as well as basic hygiene products. An early intervention process is also in place to reach out to college students who are not attending classes or who are behind in their studies. Instructors use the SAGE early alert system to make referrals multiple times during the semester. The Director and Retention Specialist then contact students to encourage class attendance and provide them with resources to be successful. Success Seminars Success Seminars are available in video format in the online College Success Seminar course in Canvas.

Advisement A Diagnostic Tools Students should direct any questions concerning the diagnostic tools available to the Director of Developmental Studies. All diagnostic tools are free to students. Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI): The focus of the LASSI is the student\u2019s thoughts, behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs that relate to successful learning. The LASSI provides students with a diagnosis of their strengths and areas of improvement, and, based on these results, they are referred to helpful resources that are available on-campus and online.
