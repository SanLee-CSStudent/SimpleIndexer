You may need one if your Online, Face-to-Face, or Hybrid class at Central Arizona College (CAC) requires you to take a proctored exam at an academic testing location or remotely. Your instructor will announce this requirement via in person, your syllabus, or in your Blackboard ULTRA course shell. In-person proctored exams can be scheduled by contacting any of the testing center locations listed below. Remote Academic Testing Remote exams are also proctored.
