Students who complete their degree requirements in the summer term will still have their degree conferred in the summer term, but will choose attendance to attend either the spring or the fall ceremony of their graduation year. Students who are eligible for an undergraduate summer ceremony are notified of this change as are department chairs and academic advisors. The Graduate School will continue to have a summer commencement ceremony for UCA graduate students.
