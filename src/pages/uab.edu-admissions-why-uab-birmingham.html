Birmingham Birmingham Looks like Birmingham\u2019s the new \u201Cit\u201D city. Do you ever do something so amazing that you surprise even yourself? In Birmingham, we knew we were becoming the next big thing, but when Cond? Nast Traveler named us one of 22 places to visit in 2022, well, we were kind of speechless. After all, this was Cond? Nast. Why Birmingham? In short, food, art, history, greenspace, entertainment, and sports. We have offerings in each of those categories that you won\u2019t find anywhere else. We\u2019re Turning Heads Birmingham has \u201Cgone from hot to blazing hot.\u201D \u2013Andrew Zimmern, chef Travel Channel, 2020 Named one of the 5th best place to travel in 2021 \u2013Travel + Leisure Recognized as 1 of 5 \u201CUp-and-coming tech hotspots\u201D \u2013Livability, 2018 Named one of the\u201CBest Places in America for Starting a Business\u201D \u2013Inc., 2018 8th best place to find a job in 2020 \u2013Glassdoor Named \u201CBest Southern Renaissance\u201D \u2013Outsider Magazine, 2017 Dining The food here will exceed your expectations. Seriously. Ask the James Beard Awards people. They practically live in Birmingham. Look up Frank Stitt. Or Chris Hastings. Or Jorge Castro. Or Denise Peterson. To us, chefs are celebrities. Visit one of their restaurants and you\u2019ll see why. Best of all, if you\u2019ve got five-star tastes but a one-star budget, you\u2019re sure to find a local eatery that\u2019s perfect for you. From barbecue and soul food to food trucks and the Pizitz Food Hall, the list goes on and on. Civil Rights African-Americans fought for change and equality right here in Birmingham, and we couldn\u2019t be prouder of their integral role in U.S. history. Learn about it at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, adjacent to the 16th Street Baptist Church. Both sit across from Kelly Ingram Park, which is filled with statues in honor of the struggle. Don\u2019t forget to check out the Negro Southern League Museum next door to Regions Field. Parks Our greenspace per capita numbers were already high, but now they\u2019re about to skyrocket. The biggest state park in our area, Oak Mountain, just completed a massive acquisition that will make it double the size of New York\u2019s Central Park. Double. Closer to campus we have the acclaimed Railroad Park where you can jog, picnic or anything else against the backdrop of the Birmingham skyline. A couple of blocks away you can connect with our beautiful Rotary Trail that winds through downtown. Don\u2019t forget about Ruffner Mountain, the Birmingham Botanical Gardens, or one of the city\u2019s best overlooks\u2014Vulcan Park and Museum. Arts Whether it\u2019s an on-stage performance, a swanky gallery, or a vibrant mural, it\u2019s hard to beat the creativity in the Magic City. From our mainstay Birmingham Museum of Art to the Alys Stephens Performing Arts Center (which sits right on campus), we have quite a collection of talent to admire. Catch a performance by the Alabama Ballet, Red Mountain Theatre Company, or Birmingham Festival Theatre. Check out the Sidewalk Film Festival, Secret Stages, ArtWalk, and, of course, the inspiring architecture at The Heaviest Corner on Earth. Or simply keep an eye out for breathtaking street art that just might bring out the artist in you. And don\u2019t forget to visit the Alabama Theatre and Lyric Theatre. Music Some pretty famous musicians are from right here in Alabama. Like, way more than our fair share. And many of them cut their teeth at some of our favorite venues across the city. Whether you want to see someone before they hit it big or catch one of today\u2019s headliners, we have plenty to offer in Birmingham. Check out hot spots like The Nick, Iron City, Saturn, Oak Mountain Amphitheatre, BJCC, and more. And when you\u2019re not rocking, remember to catch a performance by the Alabama Symphony Orchestra, Opera Birmingham, or Birmingham Broadway Series. Sports We love our sports in Birmingham. From major league to minor league, we\u2019re teeming with options for you to check out. Catch a Barons game at Regions Field. See some of the biggest names in Indy at Barber or NASCAR at nearby Talladega. The Birmingham Legion soccer team plays in the USL. We also have Birmingham Bulls hockey, the Regions Tradition Golf Tournament, and the Birmingham Squadron, an NBA G League at Legacy Arena. Of course, we love all our Blazer sports. The football team recently moved into the brand new Protective Stadium downtown, and our men\u2019s basketball team is now under the direction of Blazer legend Andy Kennedy. The Blazers will build on their momentum going forward as members of the American Athletic Conference. The World Games Speaking of sports, we\u2019re all super excited here about The 2022 World Games this year in Birmingham. They\u2019re kind of like the Olympics\u2014they\u2019re actually recognized by the International Olympic Committee\u2014but most of the sports aren\u2019t in the Olympics. You\u2019ll see events such as sport climbing, softball, sumo wrestling, tug of war, and parkour. Find out more about The World Games 2022 here. Sky\u2019s the Limit We\u2019re proud of our skyline here in Birmingham. From UAB\u2019s vantage point, it\u2019s absolutely radiant. But it\u2019s so much more than a beautiful sight. It\u2019s opportunity knocking. You see, our city\u2019s filled with businesses big and small. Some are well-established corporations. Others are innovative start-ups. And that doesn\u2019t count our many government, nonprofit and other entities. Together, they offer so many chances for you to get an internship, mentorship, and career. It\u2019s amazing.
