The CARE Team connects students that are experiencing unusual stress or challenges with a variety of resources to help address their concerns. These resources include, but are not limited to: University Counseling Services, Academic Success Center, Disability Resources, Public Safety, Residence Life, Title IX Officer, Student Involvement and Office of Spiritual Life. To register a concern about a student, please complete a CARE Team form. Faculty Resources Samford strives to equip our faculty with the resources and support they need to be successful.
