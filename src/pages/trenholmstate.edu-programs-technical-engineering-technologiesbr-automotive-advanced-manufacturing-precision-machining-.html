With high demand for this type of equipment, Trenholm State Community College offers a highly specialized program to prepare students to become general machinists. The first step to be accepted into this program is to complete the college application. Apply Now! What is Precision Machining? Machinists and Tool & Die Makers set up and operate a variety of computer-controlled and mechanically controlled machine tools to produce precision metal parts, instruments, and tools. Machinist typically do the following: Read blueprints, sketches, or computer-aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) files Set up, operate, and disassemble manual, automatic, and computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools Align, secure, and adjust cutting tools and workpieces Monitor the feed and speed of machines Turn, mill, drill, shape, and grind machine parts to specifications Measure, examine, and test completed products for defects Smooth the surfaces of parts or products Present finished workpieces to customers and make modifications if needed Tool and Die Makers typically do the following: Read blueprints, sketches, specifications, or CAD and CAM files for making tools and dies Compute and verify dimensions, sizes, shapes, and tolerances of workpieces Set up, operate, and disassemble conventional, manual, and CNC machine tools File, grind, and adjust parts so that they fit together properly Test completed tools and dies to ensure that they meet specifications Smooth and polish the surfaces of tools and dies Machinists use machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, and grinders, to produce precision metal parts. Many machinists must be able to use both manual and CNC machinery. CNC machines control the cutting tool speed and do all necessary cuts to create a part. The machinist determines the cutting path, the speed of the cut, and the feed rate by programming instructions into the CNC machine. Although workers may produce large quantities of one part, precision machinists often produce small batches or one-of-a-kind items. The parts that machinists make range from simple steel bolts to titanium bone screws for orthopedic implants. Hydraulic parts, antilock brakes, and automobile pistons are other widely known products that machinists make. Some machinists repair or make new parts for existing machinery. After an industrial machinery mechanic discovers a broken part in a machine, a machinist remanufactures the part. The machinist refers to blueprints and performs the same machining operations that were used to create the original part in order to create the replacement. Our Mission The mission of the Precision Machining program at Trenholm State Community College is to provide academic and skill courses in order for students to gain the skills and knowledge to become proficient in the Precision Machining discipline with intensive concentration on how to safely set-up and operate metalworking equipment such as engine lathes, milling machines, CNC turning and milling centers as well as other basic shop equipment including but not limited to drilling and grinding machines. The Program Trenholm State offers several options in Precision Machining that are designed to equip a student with the skills and technical knowledge needed to be a success in this interesting field. Students are assigned specific lab projects which must be completed while studying the theory directly related to the projects. Additionally, each student is taught to read blueprints, determine sequence of operations, make set-ups, and select the correct machines for the job.
