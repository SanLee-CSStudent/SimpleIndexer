Financial Aid Recipients who totally withdraw from classes: The financial aid office will perform a Return to Title IV Calculation (R2T4) to determine the amount of aid required to be refunded to the federal financial aid program(s). If a grant overpayment is due from the student, the student will be notified by mail. The student may pay the grant overpayment diretly to the school during the same academic year. At the end of the academic year, any uncollected overpayments will be turned over to the Department of Education for collections.
