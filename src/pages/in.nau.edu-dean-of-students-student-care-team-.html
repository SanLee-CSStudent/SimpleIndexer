These life events can interfere with a student\u2019s ability to attain their goals. Students may struggle with knowing who to talk to or where to go to get help or have their questions answered. Case Management at the Office of the Dean of Students is designed to support students throughout their college career in order to best achieve their academic and co-curricular goals. Case Management staff supports students in identifying the heart of an issue, finding the appropriate resources, and developing an action plan. We support and empower our students to take action and advocate on their own behalf. If you or someone you know is in need of support, submit a CARE Report or contact Kelly Reber.
