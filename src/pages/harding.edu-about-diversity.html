MISSION AND DIVERSITY Harding University integrates \u201Cfaith, learning and living\u201D in everything we do. This statement acknowledges the Christian worldview is at the core of our identity and values. We believe diversity of background and respect for those differences makes Harding better within the context of the University\u2019s code of conduct and respectful discourse and living. Our understanding of diversity is rooted in Scripture. The foundation of our Christian worldview is our belief in the Bible as the fully inspired and authoritative word of God. We hold it to be \u201CGod-breathed\u201D and the basis of our teaching and living (2 Timothy 3:16-17). The Bible is central to our goal of spiritual transformation in the life of everyone at Harding. Harding seeks to be a diverse community, and when we consider how human beings are portrayed in God\u2019s word, we discover two conditions that demonstrate our sameness in the eyes of the Lord. All people are created in the image of God; therefore, we are all of equal value to him. Scripture teaches the unity of the human race by virtue of our common creation: \u201CFrom one man God made every nation of the human race, that they should inhabit the whole earth\u201D (Acts 17:26). God\u2019s word also teaches the unity of the human race by virtue of the fact we are all created \u201Cin the image of God\u201D (Genesis 1:27). It is within this greater context of unity that humanity\u2019s diversity rightly appears: \u201CSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them\u201D (Genesis 1:27). All mankind, both male and female, are created by God and bear his image; therefore, we strive to adhere only to ideology and practice that respect the unique dignity and worth of every human being (Genesis 9:6). We strive to recognize and respect individual differences in a way that promotes the greater unity of the body of Christ and with all members of our communities (1 Corinthians 12:11-27). All people are imperfect and sinful creatures, and all are in need of God\u2019s grace and redemption. While Scripture teaches all people are created in the image of God, it reveals that, throughout its existence, humanity has lived in a state of self-willed rebellion, and \u201Call have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God\u201D (Romans 3:23). For this reason, we believe only individual behaviors that support biblical standards are pleasing to God, and therefore those standards apply equally to all who are part of the University. We therefore believe when we acknowledge God\u2019s redemptive love for every person (1 Timothy 2:3-4; 1 Peter 3:9) we will treat other human beings with grace and kindness knowing we are all those \u201Cfor whom Christ died\u201D (1 Corinthians 8:11; 1 John 4:19-21). In Acts 10 we read how God taught Simon Peter to transcend cultural and racial prejudices in order to \u201Crealize how true it is that God does not show favoritism but accepts from every nation those who fear him and do what is right. You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all\u201D (verses 34-36). Jesus commanded his disciples to share the good news of God\u2019s redeeming love with \u201Call creation\u201D (Mark 16:15-16) and to make disciples of \u201Call nations\u201D (Matthew 28:18-20). Paul emphasizes the gospel is \u201Cthe power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes\u201D regardless of their cultural or ethnic background (Romans 1:16). CONCLUSION In the last book of the Bible, we are given a glimpse of the ultimate redemption of diverse humanity as \u201Ca great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language\u201D (Revelation 7:9). We are called to minister to all people and, as part of this calling, it is Harding\u2019s mission to provide a quality education that will lead to an understanding and philosophy of life consistent with Christian ideals.
