Although we are a small university, we seek to contribute in big ways to the understanding of the unique biocultural region we inhabit, including its premier coastal rainforest, majestic icefields, and glaciers, and rich marine ecosystems. You will find in our links to projects and publications studies on the Tongass National Forest, the Juneau Icefield, and the coastal waters of Southeast Alaska. Much of our environmental research is coordinated through the pioneering Alaska Coastal Rainforest Center, as well as our highly-respected Environmental Science, Marine Biology, and Fisheries programs. In addition, we support research on the economies, cultures, politics, and history of Alaska and other regions through our Social Science and Humanities departments. Our Humanities faculty produce original and award-winning poetry, essays, Alaska Native literature and linguistic studies, including our own literary journal, Tidal Echoes. Externally-funded projects also enable UAS to expand and diversify its base. Research grants and sponsored programs not only support the mission of UAS, but also create opportunities for undergraduate research, interdisciplinary scholarship and innovative engagements with local communities, economies, and environments in Southeast Alaska and beyond. ORCA (Opportunities for Research and Creative Activity) brings together information on Student Research, Faculty Projects, Publications, News and Updates, and Research Administration materials under one umbrella. Contact Us Undergraduate Research & Creative Activity UAS students are encouraged to engage in research and creative activities inside and outside the classroom. Many students are paid to work as lab and field research assistants for UAS faculty or local agencies and organizations.

Faculty researchers provide excellent opportunities for undergraduate students to be directly involved in the cutting-edge research that they bring in. Faculty-led innovative research also plays a fundamental part in enriching the academic experience and materials in the classrooms. Faculty Research and Creative Activity Highlights Research Administration Research Administration at UAS brings together staff and faculty from multiple departments to provide support for faculty, staff, and student investigators throughout the project lifecycle. UAS, UAA, and UAF have adopted a unified business model utilizing the lifecycle concept which embraces operational effectiveness through efficiency, accountability, transparency, and responsiveness to the needs of the campus communities and the external partners with whom we do business. At UAS, research administrators include staff from the Office of Vice Provost for Research and Sponsored Programs, the Office of Grants and Contracts, and the Administrative Managers from within the various Schools. In addition, we partner with UAF to assist in the administration of research ethics and intellectual property considerations.
