Apply now Request info Frequently asked questions Is an education certificate equivalent to a degree? No. A certificate program typically focuses on a specific body of knowledge and is usually much shorter in length. Certificates are a great option if you\u2019re looking for specific knowledge or already have a degree and want to build skills outside of that program. And if you already have a bachelor\u2019s degree and want to become a licensed teacher, our Graduate Alternative Pathway Education certificates provide you with an accelerated path to the classroom if you have a bachelor\u2019s degree. Learn more about state licensure here. I am on the fence about starting my doctoral degree, do I have any certificate options? If you\u2019re on the fence about taking on a doctoral degree, our Post Master\u2019s Certificates allow you to take five courses from the core program. If you decide to move forward, the courses can be applied to the Doctor of Education (EdD) program. This gives you a route to continue to grow professionally while gaining skills to improve student achievement through research. Our Post Master\u2019s certificates do not lead to licensure. How long does it take to complete an education certificate program? That depends on the certificate. The Graduate Alternative Pathway Education certificates take a little over a year to complete, and the Post Master\u2019s Certificates take about 10 months. I have a bachelor\u2019s degree outside of education. Can I earn an education certificate to become a licensed teacher? We have three Graduate Alternative Pathway Education certificates that are designed for career changers seeking preparation for initial teacher licensure.* Learn more about state licensure. Can I apply credits earned for an education certificate toward a degree later?
