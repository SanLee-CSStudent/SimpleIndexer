Civic Engagement at Lyon College At Lyon College, we know that educating productive, involved citizens happens through relationships. Lyon College faculty and staff design service and civic engagement projects to invigorate learning about community, personal civic identity, and the strengths of both academic and community knowledge. What is Civic Engagement? Civic engagement involves \"working to make a difference in the civic life of one's community and developing the combination of knowledge, skills, values and motivation to make that difference. It means promoting the quality of life in a community, through both political and non-political processes\" (Erlich, 2000). Civic engagement includes both paid and unpaid forms of political activism, environmentalism, and community and national service (Michelson et al, 2002). Volunteering is one form of civic engagement. Goals of Lyon College's Civic Engagement Encourage faculty, staff, and student participation in volunteerism Foster knowledge and understanding of civic engagement among the campus community To expose students to societal inadequacies and injustices and empower students to remedy them Erlich, T.
