Parking is limited. By designating lots for usage by appropriate permit, UPD and the Parking Program hope to provide adequate parking and a manageable traffic flow through campus. All parking lots require permits specific to the area from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Read signs carefully. Each parking lot is signed at the entrance, and further restrictions are usually designated within the lot. Thank you for your cooperation and compliance with the Parking Program and our regulations.
