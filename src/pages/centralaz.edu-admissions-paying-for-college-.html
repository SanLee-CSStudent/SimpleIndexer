Contact Us Below Email: Student.Accounts@Centralaz.edu Phone: 520-494-5240 Expecting a Stipend or Refund? Stipends and Refunds Stipend vs. Refund \u2013 What\u2019s the difference? A stipend is excess money from a financial aid source that has approved the release of these excess funds to be disbursed directly to a student. The stipend is money left over after all tuition and fees have been paid on the student account. A stipend may result from sources that are used to pay fees such as Pell, scholarships, student loans etc. A refund is excess money that is refunded back to the student after the student self paid for fees on the student account. Money may also be refunded to a financial aid source that either over paid or is no longer providing support for the student. Expecting a Stipend or Refund? Financial aid disbursements begin taking place generally two weeks after the semester begins. A disbursement is the transfer of approved financial aid which moves from an approved status and gets placed on the student account. The amount of financial aid that is approved will cover any tuition and fees that are currently on the student account. Any money that is left over after paying all fees will be the amount that is stipend or refunded. Important: When looking at the student account in the student portal if there are parenthesis around the amount due (258.00), this means there is a credit on the student account. The Student Account Team will review all credits and determine if the money should be stipend or refunded to the student. Stipends and refunds are generally processed 7-10 business days after financial aid is applied to the student account. Stipends and refunds are sent directly to BankMobile Disbursements and processed based on the refund selection chosen by the student. BankMobile Disbursements It is time to sign up for a BankMobile Disbursements account and select a refund preference. Central Arizona College delivers your funds with BankMobile Disbursements, a technology solution, powered by BMTX, Inc.

To view our third-party servicer contract for disbursement management, click the information button below Third Party Third Party Agency What is a Third Party Agency? Third party agencies are businesses that the student has partnered with to pay some or all of their tuition and fees for a specific semester. Agencies can be but are not limited to the student\u2019s employer (tuition reimbursement), local or state agencies such as the Department of Economic Security, WIOA, VA, and many others. Agency Responsibility When an agency chooses to cover fees incurred they should partner with the student to ensure any and all documentation is current and correct. The agency is responsible for submitting an authorization letter to Student Accounts prior to the semester starting. Letters received after courses start may be delay invoice processing. Once an invoice is created and sent to the agency, they will be responsible for the total amount due. Failure to pay in a timely manner may hold up the students ability to register or receive transcripts for future semesters. Letters of Authorization should include the following: Student first and last name Student CAC ID number Semester Amount committing to pay including any course fees Conditions of authorization (ex: apply Pell prior to invoicing) Agency contact and mailing address to send refunds Note: Letters should be sent at the beginning of each semester. Invoices are only provided one semester at a time. Please send or email to the contact information below Student Responsibility Students are responsible for supplying the agency with documentation to support the payment process. Items may include but are not limited to registration bills, current cost of attendance including Out of State or WUE charges, course fees, and book pricing. The student should submit their documentation as soon as they can to their agency. Failure to provide current and proper documentation may delay the invoicing process. It is important for the student to read and understand the terms and conditions set by the agency. Terms and conditions may change at any time. Please contact the agency if you have questions regarding the authorization to pay. Invoices Invoices are generally created and sent to the agency by individual student 4-6 weeks after the semester begins. Students will continue to see a balance due on their student account until the agency submits payment. Invoices are sent to the agency by email. All invoices are due at the time of receipt. Agencies may choose to pay by individual student or they may send one payment for groups of students the agency is sponsoring. Overpayment & Excess Money Excess money may be left over on a student\u2019s account after the agency payment is posted. Student Accounts will review each account and determine how to handle the excess funds. The authorization letter should stipulate how to handle each scenario. Student Accounts will contact the agency to determine if the funds should be refunded or if the student may receive a stipend. The college does not determine what happens with the funds. Students should follow up with the agency if they feel the money should be given to them in a stipend. The agency must be clear on how to handle excess funds.

Unique Conditions Dependency Override-When applying for federal student aid, your answers to questions on Step 3 of the FAFSA classify you as either an Independent or Dependent student. Independent students report their own income and assets (and those of a spouse, if married). Dependent students report both their own and their parents\u2019 income and assets. If a student is unable to provide parent information due to extenuating circumstances, the student may complete and submit a petition to be considered an independent student. Dependency Overrides are granted on a case-by-case basis and must be documented each award year. Please contact us for more information. Special Circumstances-According to Federal regulations, a family\u2019s past income is used to assess financial need for the upcoming academic year. If a family\u2019s current income is lower due to special circumstances, a Financial Aid Administrator may be able to use the current income to assess financial need. The CAC Financial Aid Office will be reviewing such requests beginning July 1 prior to the next Academic year start. If the information provided results in a change in the type of award(s) a student can receive, their award(s) will be adjusted to reflect that change.

Procedures and forms for the appeal process and reinstatement of federal financial aid are available here. The Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy is also available to students in the college catalog. If a student\u2019s status is unsatisfactory due to a complete withdraw, the financial aid office will perform a Return to Title IV Calculation (R2T4) for that semester to determine the amount of aid that may need to be returned and if the student has a grant overpayment the student will be notified by mail.

A credit check will be conducted. ，If you have an adverse credit history, you may still qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan if you obtain an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history, or if you document to our satisfaction that there are extenuating circumstances related to your adverse credit history. (An endorser is someone who agrees to repay a Direct PLUS Loan if you do not repay the loan. ，Parents of dependent students who want to borrow should contact the Financial Aid Office to apply for a PLUS loan. Application Process Students may borrow up to the amounts listed on the Federal Direct Loan Request Form but cannot exceed their Cost of Attendance (COA). You will be required to complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN). All loans will have multiple disbursements, normally 2 per semester. See your loan disclosure statement for dates. A fee will be deducted equally from each disbursement of your loan. Follow the steps below to complete the Federal Direct Stafford Loan process. Failure to follow steps in order may delay processing of the loan. If you have any questions, please contact our office. Borrowers must submit request form prior to October 7th for Fall loans and March 11th for Spring loans and June 10th for Summer loans. Step 1: Complete Online Entrance Counseling. As a student loan borrower, you must complete Entrance Counseling so you can be completely informed before borrowing a loan. You must sign in using your FSAID. All borrowers under the Federal Direct Loan Program are required to complete online Entrance Counseling before receiving their loan. Counseling must be completed prior to submitting the Federal Direct Loan Request Form. About the Quiz ，Each Counseling Session page will provide you with information about Federal Direct Loans. There will be a quiz at the end of each section. You must complete each section and answer all the questions in order to select the \u201CContinue\u201D button and view the next page. ，Each Counseling Session page will contain right links on the right hand side to indicate the current counseling page. You may select one of the links in order to go to that page. Only completed pages will be accessible via the right navigation links. ，Your answers to the quiz will be saved if you choose to navigate to other screens. If you do not complete the counseling prior to logging out of the Direct Loan web site, your answers will not be saved, and you will have to begin a new counseling session from Step 1. ，Once you have completed the Counseling Session and quiz you will be taken to the Completion Verification page, which will display your information, the date you completed the counseling session and the type of counseling you have completed based on the type of student you told us you are. You may print a copy of the verification page for your records. The school(s) you choose will be informed electronically when you complete your counseling. ，There is a loan calculator that you can use to determine what you should borrow (for all the years you are in school). Also, based on what you have already borrowed and what you expect to borrow, you can get an idea of how much you should earn in order to repay your loans. Entrance Counseling is required each year you request a Federal Stafford Loan. Step 2: Complete Online Master Promissory Note (MPN). To sign the MPN electronically, you will need to use your FSAID. If you don\u2019t have one or you forgot FSAID, you may go to www.fsaid.ed.gov. MPN must be completed prior to submitting Federal Direct Loan Request Form. Your rights and responsibilities as a borrower are further explained on your MPN.

If your loan continues to be delinquent, the loan may go into default. <\/p> <p>Video not supported.<\/p> <p> If you are delinquent on your student loan payment for 90 days or more, your loan servicer will report the delinquency to the three major national credit bureaus. If you continue to be delinquent, your loan is at risk of going into default. After at least 270 days and no scheduled loan payments have been made, you will be considered to be in default. Keep in mind even if you are delinquent on your loan, you may still be able to avoid going into default, so it\u2019s important that you contact your loan servicer immediately. NEVER ignore delinquency or default notices from your loan servicer\u2014defaulting on your loan can have serious consequences. Consequences of Default You are responsible for repaying your student loans even if you did not complete your program of study or had trouble finding a job after graduation, or even if you are not satisfied with your education. You cannot disregard your federal student loan obligation. Defaulting on your student loans can carry serious consequences. <\/p> <p>Video not supported.<\/p> <p> There are several affordable repayment options that you may be able to take advantage of to continue making loan payments even when times are tough.

Two main ways to get out of default are loan rehabilitation and loan consolidation. While loan rehabilitation takes several months to complete, you can quickly apply for loan consolidation. However, loan rehabilitation provides certain benefits that are not available through loan consolidation.

VA Benefits Liz Barrett link Arizona Education and training voucher (ETV) The Arizona Education and Training Voucher (ETV) is a federally funded grant used to support foster youth who have aged out of the foster care system and who are enrolled in college, university and vocational training programs. Students may receive up to $5,000 a year based on their cost of attendance. They must enroll before their 21st birthday and may continue to receive support until age 23. Funds may be used for tuition, housing, books, student loan repayments and qualified living expenses. Eligibility Requirements To qualify, applicants must meet the following conditions: must be in foster care, adopted from foster care after age 16, or aged out of foster care be US citizens or qualified non-citizens be younger than 21 to apply for the first time have a high school diploma or GED have been accepted into or enrolled in a Title IV, accredited college or vocational\/technical training program personal assets (bank account, car, home, etc.) must be worth less than $10,000 To apply, applicants must complete the following forms: The Foster Care to Success Student Portal offers one application to apply for both the Arizona Foster Youth Award and the Arizona Education and Training Voucher (ETV). The application opens each July 1. Once the student submits the application, the Foster Care to Success offices will reach out to the student to discuss enrollment in school, housing, working, etc. The Financial Aid Release Form must be filled out. The financial aid office will fill in the cost of attendance and all of the student\u2019s other loans, grants and scholarships and sends it to ETV. This shows ETV the student\u2019s ESTIMATED NEED. The ETV Student Participation Agreement explains the student\u2019s responsibilities as a program participant and must be signed and faxed or mailed to ETV before funding is disbursed. Once the ETV office has received all forms, they will determine a student\u2019s need and send an award letter to qualified students. ETV will send awarded funds (up to $2,500 per semester) directly to CAC and CAC will post those funds to the student\u2019s account. This transaction may post after the fall semester has begun. Students with questions may contact the Financial Aid office. Every student\u2019s financial situation is unique. In some situations, even with the Arizona Foster Youth Award and full Education and Training Voucher (ETV) funding, students may need to consider loans to cover their costs. CAC reminds students to borrow wisely, as loans must be paid back with interest. Students must re-apply online for every new school year. However, ETV funds are assigned one term at a time and students are required to complete and submit a new Financial Aid Release Form each semester. The ETV Program needs to update students\u2019 financial information, school enrollment, attendance and educational progress before any funds are assigned, and therefore the forms must be submitted on a semester basis. At the end of every term funded by ETV, ETV must receive the student\u2019s official transcript, including final grades for that term, mailed directly from the registrar. Faxed, emailed or unofficial copies of transcripts\/grade sheets will not be accepted. ETV funding will NOT be disbursed until the student\u2019s transcript has been received.
