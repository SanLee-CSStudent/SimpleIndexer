About The Program There are approximately 280 million vehicles on the road in the United States, and all of them will need repairs at some point. Automotive service technicians are needed to keep to vehicles operating safely. Northark\u2019s program is based on the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) curriculum developed by the National Automotive Technical Education Foundation (NATEF). Students concentrate on seven major areas of automotive service with emphasis on preparation for the associated ASE Certification examinations. Additionally, students learn proper shop management procedures through extensive lab assignments in the College\u2019s live shop. Students are strongly encouraged to purchase a basic set of tools after the first semester in the AST program. Almost all dealerships and independent repair facilities require technicians to have their own tools and are reluctant to hire technicians who do not. A number of tool manufacturers (Snap On, SK, MAC, etc.) provide significant educational discounts to students. Information on these discount purchase programs is available from AST program instructors. Paying for College Northark is affordable! We offer nearly $500,000 annually through institutional and foundation scholarships in addition to federal and state aid. See our scholarships and other financial aid programs.
