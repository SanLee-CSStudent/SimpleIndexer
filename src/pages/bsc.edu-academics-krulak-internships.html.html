How do I get an internship? Landing the perfect internship will not follow a strict linear process: to be effective, you\u2019ll need to keep your eyes and ears open to opportunities and regularly plan and connect with others. The sooner you start planning for your internship, the better. The main activities to landing an internship include: meeting with faculty and staff at BSC to get advice; scanning Handshake and your networks for opportunities; shaping your resume for specific positions and applying; and drafting the learning contract with your faculty sponsor. Seek advice from faculty or staff. Make an appointment with staff in the Krulak Institute or Career Services to discuss your options and review your interests. Meet with a representative as early as possible, ideally early in the fall or spring term prior to when you hope to have an internship. Some opportunities require planning two terms in advance. You can schedule meetings using Handshake. Scan for opportunities. Use your networks to identify options. Talk with faculty and staff at BSC, people you have met in the community, and spend time regularly scanning opportunities in the Handshake database. Generate a list and make initial contact to inquire about application timelines or specific expectations for interns at the organization. Reviewing opportunities will help you clarify your interests and what you hope to gain from the internship experience. Shape your resume and apply. Update your resume and online profiles (e.g., Handshake and LinkedIn): emphasize your skills, relevant experiences, and aspirations. Solicit feedback and use tutorials to build a strong profile, and prepare for your interviews through mock interviews and other practice sessions. Tailor your resume for specific internships, then apply. Draft your learning contract. Work with a faculty sponsor (and your internship site, if possible) to craft a proposal for your learning contract so that you can earn credit. Your contract serves as the way to formalize your learning insights from the internship and ensures you earn academic credit for your work. Details about completing an individualized learning contract can be found here. Enroll in an Internship Course or Project Multiple departments and offices have regular, ongoing internship opportunities for which you can either register or apply. Many of these opportunities are offered during the regular term. Some departments also offer internships opportunities during Exploration Term and the summer terms. How do I enroll in an internship course or project? Opportunities that receive course credit will be listed as options in Self-Service as part of regular registration. Other opportunities, such as the Hess Fellows Advocacy and Anti-Poverty Internship Program, will be promoted through ENGAGE and elsewhere. Fall, Spring, Summer Term Courses.

These courses are typically number 297 or 397 in the course schedule. Check with individual departments to verify listings. Once you enroll in the course, contact the professor and a representative from the Krulak Institute to determine your specific internship site. Exploration Term Projects. Other departments and programs offer internships during Exploration Term. The Departments of History and Religion have both offered regular Exploration Term internship opportunities, and pre-health students have multiple options.
