Written by: Laura Gasque Media contact: Hannah Echols Almost a decade after being diagnosed with a brain tumor, Julia York will graduate from the UAB School of Nursing and begin her first job as a hematology-oncology nurse at Children's of Alabama. (Photography: Frank Couch)One week after Julia York\u2019s 12th birthday, doctors gave her parents some horrible news: Julia had less than a year to live. Now, almost a decade later, York is set to graduate with a degree in nursing from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Growing up, York struggled with migraines; but the symptoms seemed to get worse with age. After a relentless headache sent York to an urgent care clinic, a neurologist ordered an MRI scan of her brain. \u201CThat\u2019s when we found out I had a brain tumor smack dab in the middle of my brain stem,\u201D York said. \u201CI did not have a biopsy done of my tumor because they thought even that would be too risky.\u201D She began radiation therapy \u2014 33 rounds of it. Her parents enrolled her in a clinical trial, and she started taking chemotherapy pills. \u201CI had a really bad reaction to it. I lost all my hair, and I got an infection that put me in the hospital for a couple of days, so they had to remove me from the trial,\u201D York said. \u201CMy parents were left looking for other options for treatment just because there are so few options for treatment of pediatric brain tumors.\u201D Learn more about degrees in nursing here. After months of MRI scans every two weeks, doctors noticed something. The contrast dye was no longer showing up in the tumor, meaning the blood flow to the tumor had been cut off. Slowly, doctors started backing off the MRI schedule \u2014 from once a month to every three months and now once a year. York never showed any more side effects. The tumor had stopped growing. \u201CMy doctors are fascinated with my case because I shouldn\u2019t have lived,\u201D York said. \u201CI hate saying it just because it sounds a little crazy, but it\u2019s truly like a miracle case.\u201D Because of the chemotherapy, York is immunocompromised. When she was hospitalized in high school for a suspected meningitis infection, York went in for treatment and came out with a newfound passion. \u201CI was talking with my nurse and decided that nursing was the right path for me,\u201D York said. \u201CI had an epiphany that that\u2019s what I\u2019m meant to do with my life and my experience.\u201D During a campus visit, York fell in love with the UAB undergraduate experience and urban campus and decided to apply to the School of Nursing. \u201CEverything just really lined up for me to come to UAB,\u201D said York, who is a Dean\u2019s Nursing Scholar and Honors College student. \u201CUAB provided me with the support and knowledge I needed to accomplish my goals and pursue my dreams.\u201D After graduation, York will begin work as a nurse on the Children\u2019s of Alabama Hematology-Oncology\/Bone Marrow Transplant unit in July. \u201CI love kids, and I want to use my story to help those who are in a position similar to what I was in,\u201D York said. \u201CI have literally been in their shoes, so it is easier for me to understand what they\u2019re going through. It is another way I can care for my patients.\u201D Read more about UAB\u2019s outstanding graduating seniors here. From having less than a year to live to graduating with her dream job, York realized her unique journey gave her one of the greatest skills a nurse can have \u2014 empathy. \u201CI always had the mindset that everything happens for a reason,\u201D York said. \u201CI got cancer for a reason, and I lived for a reason, and I think it was for me to come to UAB and become a nurse, specifically become an oncology nurse, and use all of those experiences for something bigger.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
