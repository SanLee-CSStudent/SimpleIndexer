Our office is making strides to ensure that students and service members with disabilities receive full access to UCA classrooms, programs, and events. What is a disability? A disability is defined as a temporary or permanent condition that substantially limits one or more daily living activities. Daily living activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.
