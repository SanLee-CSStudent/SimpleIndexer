The English Language Acquisition program in the Adult Education Department at Calhoun Community College uses rigorous research and evidence based instruction to teach reading, writing, speaking, and listening at every level. The core texts used in each class have been developed by expert English educators who develop courses of study based on research and standards. Each teacher enhances the learning environment in his or her classroom by incorporating recommendations from the professional development conferences held by Alabama and Mississippi Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (AMTESOL) and Alabama Association for Public Continuing and Adult Education (ALAPCAE). We have adopted the same goal as that of the federal government in establishing the Common Core Standards \u2013 to prepare students for college and careers. Just as the Common Core is grounded in cognitive science and incorporates practices that have been proven to improve student learning and achievements (such as scaffolding, holding students to higher expectations, and incorporating latest research), our program is based on the expertise and recommendations of the leading professionals in the field of English education. Register for Classes Training and Requirements Calhoun\u2019s English as a Second Language program is operated through Alabama\u2019s post-secondary institutions out of the Adult Education Department.
