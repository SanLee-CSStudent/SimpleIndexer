The AQIP program was a quality-based, continuous improvement model of accreditation provided by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The pathway is being sunset and SAU has moved to the HLC\u2019s Open Pathway. The University continues its commitment to CQI on the Open Pathway. Accreditation Southern Arkansas University has maintained its accreditation by The Higher Learning Commission since 1929, completing our last comprehensive evaluation in 2013. In 2017, SAU completed a Systems Portfolio and received its Systems Appraisal. Following the Systems Appraisal, the University has transitioned to the Open Pathway and maintains on-going continuous improvement initiatives that infuse the principles and benefits of continuous improvement into the culture of the University and its colleges. Within the Continuous Quality Improvement site, you will find SAU\u2019s mission statement, goals and objectives, past AQIP Systems Portfolios, and the processes and people that are working together to promote our culture of continuous quality improvement.
