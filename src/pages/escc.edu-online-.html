Health Safety at ESCC Still have questions? We have answers! Q: Why should I choose online learning? A: Online learning offers students more flexibility than traditional on-campus classes; Students can access course work and submit assignments on their own time schedule \u2013 early in the morning or late at night. The IT Department performs student data uploads (for registered\/paid students) twice daily until the last day to drop\/add. Please allow 24 hours for registration changes to appear in Canvas. Q: What costs are associated with online classes? A: Students who enroll in distance education courses but do not test at Enterprise State Community College campuses or sites may incur an additional cost, a proctoring fee. All proctoring fees are the responsibility of the student. All other class fees are the same as our on-campus fees. Q: How do I update my contact information? A: At ESCC, it\u2019s important that we stay in contact with our current students, especially now while classes are online. We try to use every method of communication possible, including text messaging, to share important information with our students. We don\u2019t want anyone to miss important information, so we are asking students to make sure their contact information in their myESCC account is up to date. Not sure how to update your information? This video shows you how: Q: Classes have started. What do I need to do first? A: You must complete the Attendance Verification Quiz during the first 5 calendar days of the semester to ensure you are actively participating in the course. This is your instructor\u2019s way of calling roll in your online course. If you do not complete the Attendance Verification Quiz within the first 5 days of the semester you will be dropped from the official course roll, your financial aid will be affected, and you will not be allowed back into the course without approval from the Dean of Instruction. Any communication other than completing the Attendance Verification Quiz (emailing your instructor, completing an assignment, or posting to the discussion board) will not ensure you are actively participating in the course and you will still be dropped. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU COMPLETE THE ATTENDANCE VERIFICATION QUIZ ASAP! Q: How do I contact my instructor? A: Do you see the \u201CInbox\u201D to the left of your screen on the green ribbon? This will be your inbox for all of your courses. (This is a separate system than your student email, but you will receive notifications in your student email when you receive a message in Canvas.) This is to help keep all of the communications threads organized. Remember Communication with Your Instructor is Key to your SUCCESS in an Online Course. Q: Do I have to come to campus for anything? A: You will not be required to come to campus this semester. Your exams this semester will be proctored by Honorlock. Honorlock is an online proctoring service that allows you to take your exam from the comfort of your home. Honorlock is available 24\/7, all you need is a computer with a Google Chrome browser downloaded, webcam, and an Internet connection. You will not need to create an account or schedule a time.

We also recommend you take a practice quiz with Honorlock, prior to your real exam. Q: How is attendance taken? A: For a distance education course, a \u201CNo-Show\u201D student is one who has never actively participated in the course before the attendance verification deadline. Active participation is defined as completing the Attendance Verification Quiz for each online course in which the student is enrolled, communication between the student and instructor, within the college\u2019s learning management system, regarding the subject matter of the course or a related academic matter or completion of a class assignment. The Attendance Verification Quiz must be completed by noon on the 5th day of each semester. Logging into the course or sending an email is not considered active participation. LAST DATE OF ATTENDANCE \u2013 ESCC adopts the Department of Education definition of Last Date of Attendance (LDA) for distance education courses. Last Date of Attendance is defined as: \u201C\u2026 the last date the student participated in an online discussion or made contact with a faculty member\u201D. Students who receive a grade of \u201CF\u201D must be assigned a last date of attendance. This date must be the date the student participated in an online discussion or made contact with a faculty member, not the last time the student logged into the course. Q: Help! I\u2019m having technical difficulties. A: If you encounter technical issues with Canvas, please contact Dr. Amy Mosley amosley@escc.edu. If you encounter issues with your email please contact Information Technology at helpdesk@escc.edu.
