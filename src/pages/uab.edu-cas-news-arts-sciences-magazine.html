After an unprecedented academic year, the UAB College of Arts and Sciences community takes a moment to highlight the profound achievements of our faculty, students, alumni, and staff. Although the pandemic prompted pivots and presented challenges, the people of the College exercised a determined and resilient spirit, and, now, we look to the future with optimism and hope. Read more... A New Day: Navigating a pandemic and looking to the future Arts and Sciences faculty gather to discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by the pandemic.

Photo by Nik Layman.There is an ebb and flow to the world that stretches across the centuries. Breakdowns are followed by breakthroughs. Desolation sparks inspiration. Harsh reality is softened by imaginative artistry. And so, the plague of the 14th century led to the revival of the Renaissance. The flu pandemic of 1918-19 was followed by the Jazz Age of the Roaring Twenties. And the horrors of World War II were replaced by an outpouring of aesthetic creativity and scientific advancement. The world stands at the edge of another historic transition, as we emerge slowly from the COVID-19 pandemic. As difficult as the past 18 months have been (and the immediate future still appears to be), this is not unprecedented territory. There have always been challenging events to endure. And yet, the world somehow has always recovered, usually with a big assist from the arts and sciences. \u201CThe humanities are going to be needed when the pandemic is over,\u201D said David Chan, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Philosophy. \u201COne of the things you\u2019re finding nowadays is that people need to find meaning\u2026 because it all seems so random. That\u2019s where literature, art, philosophy all come in. They help people cope with change and disasters.\u201D \u201CHow do you tell a story about all this so it helps [people] find meaning? These are questions that are being addressed in every branch of the humanities, and that\u2019s where [the College of Arts and Sciences] brings something,\u201D said Chan. Or as Rich Gere, MFA, professor and chair of the Department of Art and Art History, says, \u201CHistorically, if you look at resilience within community, after every major disaster, [society] looks to the arts to bring it back. Right after the first responders, the second responders are artists.\u201D It is a daunting task, but one that the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) is ready to handle. In August 2021, Dean Kecia M. Thomas, brought together five members of the College to discuss the challenges of the previous year, and the opportunities that are on the horizon. Even this roundtable was affected by the ongoing pandemic, as the late-summer surge in COVID-19 cases led to the scheduled in-person gathering being changed to a Zoom meeting. Still, the participants expressed optimism about the future and acknowledged the way CAS has handled things so far. From left to right: David Chan, Rich Gere, and Verna Keith The past year Thomas took over as dean on Aug. 1, 2020. Not only did it mark a dramatic change in her life after spending the previous 27 years at the University of Georgia, but the move occurred in the midst of the pandemic. \u201CThis has been a really eventful year, and it\u2019s not over,\u201D Thomas said. \u201CI\u2019ve had to learn to give myself a little patience and grace as I\u2019ve learned this new role in this new place in this new city.\u201D Of course, life changed for everybody last year in some way, and the key was to adapt to the situation. For CAS faculty, that included suddenly being required to teach students through remote learning. \u201CWe had to learn the technology very quickly,\u201D said Shahid Mukhtar, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Biology. \u201CCAS Information Technology helped us tremendously.\u201D \u201CIt actually made us better teachers in the classroom, because now we know how we can effectively communicate with our students even when we\u2019re not present in the same place. And when we come back to campus, we can utilize some of those newly acquired skills.\u201D Indeed, the entire interaction between faculty and students has changed since the start of the pandemic. And, in an odd way, being apart actually helped bring both parties closer together. \u201COne of the things that I learned was how to talk to students on a different kind of level,\u201D said Verna Keith, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Sociology. \u201CSince I\u2019m the chair, they\u2019re expecting a certain kind of interaction. But when I had to call them at home and check on them during this pandemic because we hadn\u2019t heard from them, it generated a totally different kind of conversation.\u201D \u201CI realized that the position of chair when you\u2019re in an office creates one kind of dynamic, but when you\u2019re talking with somebody on the phone it created a different dynamic. They saw me in a different light, so we had a different kind of conversation.\u201D This, in turn, created a different kind of relationship. One in which the teachers also depended upon the students for their own grounding. \u201CI realized I get a sense of purpose from helping my students,\u201D said Lauren Rast, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Physics. \u201CTeaching them in ways that help their future and their careers. \u2026 It\u2019s vital, not just for them but also for my own ability to maintain resilience.\u201D From left to right: Shahid Mukhtar, Lauren Rast, and Kecia Thomas Lessons learned One aspect of the Zoom experience that Dean Thomas enjoyed was the opportunity to see students and professional colleagues in a more relaxed atmosphere. \u201CSo many people have apologized during Zoom meetings when a toddler or a cat walked through the background,\u201D Thomas said. \u201CBut I love it, because we don\u2019t often get the opportunity to remind each other of our humanity. That we are full, whole people beyond these very limited roles that we occupy. \u2026 That we have rich lives outside of work. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to hold onto coming out of this pandemic.\u201D There also were professional positives to emerge from the remote approach. And in time, Gere said many of the early skeptics came to understand and appreciate those benefits. \u201CI had people who self-proclaimed that they are not technology people and can\u2019t teach online,\u201D Gere said. \u201CAbout halfway through the semester last fall they said, \u2018Thank you for forcing me to do this.\u2019 \u2026 Some faculty thought it was going to be a train wreck of a semester, but they did really well.\u201D \u201COne of the things I\u2019ve also noticed is that everybody is always on time to a Zoom meeting. Thirty years in academia, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201D In addition, the acceptance of remote learning has opened up a wider array of guest lecturers. Keith pointed out that it is much easier for somebody to devote 90 minutes of time to talking with a class through a Zoom meeting, as opposed to traveling to Birmingham and speaking in person. \u201CZoom opened up a lot of avenues, because now we can expose our students to people all over the United States and internationally,\u201D Keith said. \u201CPeople have been generous about accepting engagements on Zoom. We\u2019ve been able to bring some fairly prominent folks to talk to our students, and that\u2019s probably going to continue.\u201D Despite the heavier reliance on technology, there remained opportunities to inject a human element into the teaching. Rast said she began opening every remote class by simply asking the students if they were doing OK. Students in facemasks paint an outdoor mural at the UAB Solar House. \u201CIf you can humanize yourself, that helps you to connect,\u201D said Rast. \u201CIt helps them to learn, but also to feel supported in the learning environment. I definitely plan to continue that.\u201D Beyond the pandemic While the response to COVID-19 dominated 2020, there were other important topics, including issues involving social justice and voting rights. \u201CCertainly, health and the pandemic are the biggest things on everyone\u2019s mind,\u201D Thomas said. \u201CBut there are also the issues of race and social justice, and what people are calling \u2018the national reckoning.\u2019\u201D \u201CAs we think about health, emerging technologies, and how we engage society\u2014this issue of trying to establish an inclusive community and eradicate the injustices and inequities and disparities\u2014how do the arts and sciences fit in with those [topics]? I think there is space for our disciplines to connect to all those areas.\u201D Keith said one element of community engagement already underway in Birmingham is the Live HealthSmart Alabama project, which was the winner of the inaugural UAB Grand Challenge. The goal of the project is to dramatically improve the state of Alabama\u2019s health rankings by the year 2030. Initially, the project consists of four demonstration communities, including one on the UAB campus. The UAB Minority Health & Health Disparities Research Center will work with the communities to promote nutrition, physical activity, and preventive wellness. \u201CThis offers a lot of opportunities for different aspects of CAS to be involved,\u201D Keith said. \u201CSome of us are involved in the research side, but you can also be involved as a faculty member or a student. This is one of those things where we can build community engagement into our classes and also involve students in this worthwhile project.\u201D As for the overall social issues, Chan said the pandemic put a spotlight on the ways injustices and inequalities affect communities, providing relevant cases that can be used in coursework. \u201COne of my colleagues teaches a class in Family and Philosophy. She deals with issues about families and raising children,\u201D Chan said. \u201CWe have students who are working mothers, and they can have problems taking classes. She found that the pandemic gave her examples she could use in class that students could relate to, because they were actually experiencing that in their lives.\u201D Career development and more While one of the primary purposes of higher education is to prepare students for a career, it also is a place where students learn about life itself. \u201CI do believe, of course, that our students should be prepared to pursue a career when they graduate. But I also think that our mission is a little bit broader, and we need to serve the whole person,\u201D Thomas said. The answer, once again, could involve community engagement. Mukhtar said he would like to see even more programs and workshops that showcase the engagement opportunities CAS has to offer, in order to help students determine the career path that might be best for them. \u201CSome kids are first-generation college students. Who can guide them? Where is the information? What are their (career) paths?\u201D Mukhtar said. \u201CWe need ... to educate students from the ground up.\u201D One area of opportunity is in the field of data management. According to analysis by the Birmingham Business Alliance, data scientist jobs in the Birmingham region have increased by more than 45 percent over the past five years, and these positions on average pay 65 percent more (approximately $26,000 more annually) than jobs not requiring analysis skills. UAB is engaging in this growing field through the Magic City Data Collective, a partnership with the Birmingham Business Alliance and the Birmingham Education Foundation, with funding help through a grant from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation. The goal is to bring local students, researchers, and data experts together to work on projects, enabling students to improve their analytics and computational skills. \u201CWe recruited a really diverse student population, and in an interdisciplinary hands-on way these students were empowered to come up with results that were relevant to the city of Birmingham and will help make data-driven decisions for our community,\u201D said Rast, who serves as the learning manager for the project. \u201CWhen we have this information and locals are able to use data to make decisions and impact their community, that\u2019s a positive thing we can do at the College of Arts and Sciences. It was my favorite thing that I\u2019ve done all year.\u201D Looking ahead Dean Thomas wrapped up the hour-long discussion by asking each participant for a parting thought. Their messages indicated that despite all the difficulties of the past 18 months (and counting), their outlook remains optimistic, propelled in part by the determination of CAS and UAB as a whole to work together for a better future. CHAN: \u201CMy message would be to build connections while you\u2019re here, and stay connected after you leave. See what you can build here and then continue the relationships. This isn\u2019t just some phase in a life\u2014it is something that will be with you all your life.\u201D RAST: \u201CI\u2019d love to engage with my fellow UAB faculty and staff and students across disciplines in ways that break silos. Because of the diversity of our UAB community and our background interests, there is a lot of opportunity for creativity and ideas that benefit our community.\u201D MUKHTAR: \u201CWe are a UAB family. And one of the things we learned during this pandemic is that life is so fragile. Today we are together and the next day we are not. We\u2019ve known this, but when you see it firsthand, then you really feel it and it touches you deeply inside. Today at the College of Arts and Sciences, we are closer to each other than we were two years ago. That affects all of us\u2026 So my message would be just to be together as a UAB family and be more productive as a member of the family.\u201D KEITH: \u201CI\u2019d like to give a shout-out to the entire faculty in CAS\u2026 Our faculty are the people who are creative, who make discoveries, who produce knowledge. Rather than just being people who pass knowledge on, they are doing that work themselves. So students who come to UAB are lucky that they\u2019re exposed to that. It\u2019s something that will last them for a lifetime.\u201D GERE: \u201CI\u2019d like to speak on behalf of my colleagues in theatre and dance and music. Because the last 18 months have been a reminder that the arts help pull everybody together\u2026 These are great and strong programs, and they attract top-notch students from Alabama and beyond.\u201D Read more... Keeping human rights relevant during the pandemic Nothing brings human rights into focus quite like a global pandemic. Nothing brings human rights into focus quite like a global pandemic. At the UAB Institute for Human Rights (IHR), we knew from the beginning that no matter what adjustments we needed to make in our programming or day-to-day operations, we had important work to do bringing attention to the disparities and devastations that COVID-19 would invariably wreak on the world. While we were grappling with how the pandemic would impact our own lives, it became the focus and mission of the IHR to provide information and insight into the perspectives and experiences of people whose lives were impacted in vastly different (and often more devastating) ways. Our interns got to work researching and posting about the horrors of COVID-19 for the most vulnerable among us, focusing on how the pandemic was exposing and exacerbating human rights violations for People of Color in the United States, refugees and displaced persons in the Middle East, women, persons with disabilities, and the LGBTQ+ community in the U.S. and around the world. In March 2020, we had to cancel the remainder of our guest lecture series, but by fall, we had pivoted to hosting our events in the virtual space. In some ways, it opened up opportunities for us to invite international speakers we would have otherwise had a hard time hosting. With the murder of George Floyd and the insurgence of protests in support of Black Lives Matter over the summer, we decided to focus our fall programming around the duel pandemics of COVID-19 and racial injustice, considering how they were interconnected and how dealing with one required dealing with the other as well. Of course, all of this was happening during one of the most contentious election seasons in recent history. Here are some highlights from the past year. IHR Blog In March 2020, as the United States was just beginning to grapple with the virus, I wrote about how public health policy and legislation in response to COVID-19 would have significant consequences on human rights, and how states and public health agencies should be intentional about protecting human rights as they develop and implement policies aimed at abating the spread of the virus. IHR Blog intern Carmen Ross wrote about the intersections of the coronavirus and racism, discussing how the rise in hate speech, violence, and discrimination against people of Asian descent fit into the historical pattern of unfairly blaming a particular group of people for the outbreak of a disease. Our guest blogger, Grace Ndanu, who lives in Kenya, enlightened our readership on how the pandemic was playing out in her country and the disparities she was noticing along the fissures of the rural\/urban divide. We also invited middle school students from Birmingham City Schools to write about their perspectives and experiences. They wrote about the difficulties transitioning to an online learning environment and how they hoped the Black Lives Matter protests would inspire real and lasting change in the way our institutions regard the value of Black people. IHR Guest Speaker Events In the Spring of 2020, we started a series of virtual events called Human Rights in Times of COVID-19. For each event, we invited a panel of experts to discuss different issues related to a human rights approach to managing a global pandemic. We began with a discussion of public safety versus individual liberty, talking about how to navigate the tension created by the authority of governments to impede on individual rights in times of public emergencies such as pandemics and the implications for human rights and people\u2019s lives in the U.S. and elsewhere. Leading up to the fall semester, we invited education experts to discuss how the response to COVID-19 affected the right to education for students in situations of more or less privilege and access. We also hosted an event with the Offender Alumni Association, which works to assist formerly incarcerated people to re-enter the job market, find affordable housing, and achieve success and well-being in their lives after prison. In addition, we hosted a panel discussion on voting as a human right that featured local activists, civil rights foot soldiers, and political scientists. One of the opportunities that came with the virtual format was the ability to invite international scholars and human rights advocates from all around the world to give us perspectives on human rights and human rights violations in places such as Turkey, Greece, the Palestinian territories, the U.K., and Cuba, among others. Social Justice Caf? With quarantine and working from home, along with heightened political tensions pervading the national discourse, we recognized the need for people to engage with one another and discuss everything going on. This prompted us to start the Social Justice Caf?, a virtual space to come together and have these discussions. This space is welcoming and inclusive; it is built around civil discourse and meaningful connection. Over the course of the spring semester, we met to discuss the Biden administration\u2019s approach to human rights, Dr. King\u2019s notion of equity and how to carry that forward in the 21st century, the rise in anti-Asian violence and discrimination, the insurrection, extremism and transitional justice, and the crisis at the U.S.\/Mexico border. We plan to continue our virtual programming, and we encourage you to join us! Find upcoming events for the Institute for Human Rights and subscribe to their newsletter. Read more...

Palazzo, Ph.D., Dean of the College of Arts & Sciences If you haven't been to campus lately, I can't stress enough how different the environment is from what you may remember from your student days. As always, fall is a busy time here in the College of Arts and Sciences. With enrollments continuing to grow, it seems that students are everywhere\u2014in the hallways, on the sidewalks, and crossing the Green and Mini Park. Across University Boulevard from our offices here in Heritage Hall, I've enjoyed seeing students taking advantage of the wonderful indoor and outdoor facilities at the Hill Student Center: enjoying concerts, working with clubs and organizations, and socializing at festivals and food events. If you haven't been to campus lately, I can't stress enough how different the environment is from what you may remember from your student days. Our new Arts & Sciences academic building is an important addition to the increasingly sophisticated and attractive campus that UAB is creating. When our building opens next fall, it will be home to seven of our 19 academic departments, complete with offices, conference and meeting rooms, classrooms, and a 300-seat auditorium, all equipped with the latest technology and equipment to ensure the best possible research and instruction for our faculty and students. But we know the building will also be another one of the popular gathering spaces for our growing student body. There will be bright, well-furnished indoor spaces where they can relax, study, or spend time with friends. The outside terrace, with its view of the Green, Dining Commons, residence halls, and Recreation Center, will become one of the best spots on campus to see and be seen. And with its location on the corner of 10th Avenue South and 14th Street South, it will provide an important anchor to this side of campus, and a gateway to the buildings nearby. Help us build a legacy by supporting our new building project. Learn more about naming opportunities. We look forward to seeing you on campus this fall. Go Blazers! R.E. Palazzo, Dean Read more... Spring 2018 events in the College of Arts & Sciences Catch up with some of the big events sponsored by the College of Arts and Sciences, from Spring Flings to an exhibit at AEIVA. Spring Flings Perhaps there's no better way to end a semester than by honoring both our students who receive valuable scholarships and the donors who so generously support them. Our Scholarship and Awards Luncheon is always a special event and is a chance for students and their donors to meet and learn more about each other. This year, in addition to three student speakers, we were also inspired by a performance by the Carlos Pino UAB Jazz Combo. We also enjoyed several fun alumni gatherings, including a party at Regions Field when the UAB Baseball team played the Birmingham Barons. And alumnus Alexander Shunnarah graciously hosted us at his office overlooking Sloss Furnaces, where faculty and alumni enjoyed an evening together. [widgetkit id=\"40\" name=\"MAGAZINE - Fall 2018 - Spring Flings\"] Ireland Award and AEIVA We were honored to present the Ireland Distinguished Visiting Scholar Award to Andrew Solomon, a prolific and award-winning writer and activist.

Award winning: What it takes for students to win major scholarships and awards The number of College of Arts and Sciences students who win major national and international scholarships and fellowships grows every year. What does it take to win one of these major prizes? The number of College of Arts and Sciences students who win major national and international scholarships and fellowships grows every year. What does it take to win one of these major prizes? And what does the achievement mean for our students as they pursue their goals? Sarah Faulkner, a 2017 graduate with bachelor\u2019s degrees in art with a concentration in art history and sociology. When chemistry major Gunnar Eastep fell asleep early after his last final in fall of 2017, he never dreamed that he\u2019d wake up to a nomination for the Barry Goldwater Scholarship. \u201CWhen I woke up, I saw the nomination and was pretty ecstatic about it,\u201D he says. \u201CAll-around, it was a very surreal experience, especially since I had no clue what to expect.\u201D He had turned in the application about a month before he found out. \u201CI spent a week writing terrible drafts and deleting them the next day,\u201D he says. \u201CI found it challenging to write a succinct and interesting personal statement without sounding overly clich?d.\u201D But this portion of the application wasn\u2019t the only part that challenged Eastep. Outside of the personal statement and description of future goals, the application also requires students to write a research proposal detailing the work they\u2019ve already accomplished as well as discussing what comes next. However, unlike most scientific journals, this proposal has to be written in the first person. For Eastep, this portion meant detailing the research he\u2019d pursued under Dr. Jamil Saad, assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology, who has a secondary appointment in the Department of Chemistry. Here, he\u2019d studied the role of a particular protein in certain portions of retrovirus replication. Before last summer, his work had focused on the protein\u2019s role in replicating the avian sarcoma virus. Eastep says the support he received from faculty was critical to his completion of the application, and his success in winning the Goldwater. \u201CWithout Dr. Saad and the experiences I\u2019ve had doing research in his lab, winning the Goldwater scholarship wouldn\u2019t have been possible,\u201D he says. \u201CIt certainly gives me a lot of confidence moving forward. \u201DDr. Gray in the chemistry department has been a great help for me, too,\u201D Eastep adds. \u201DHe was the professor for several of my chemistry courses and wrote one of my recommendations for the scholarship. Although he didn't mentor my research, he was so helpful in giving career advice and has undoubtedly been my favorite professor.\u201D OPTIONS The science-focused Goldwater Scholarship is only one of the many prestigious scholarships and fellowships that College of Arts and Sciences students can apply for. These programs range widely from scholarships for students in specific disciples to fellowships, which provide short-term learning opportunities. These experiences also vary: some support research projects at specific universities, while others are aimed at developing independent research projects on a myriad of subjects. Sources of funding for these programs are just as diverse as the offerings themselves. Some, like the Fulbright U.S. Student Program, are sponsored by federal government agencies to bolster international relationships. Other governmental agencies fund scholarships aimed at ensuring future public servants speak languages critical to international diplomacy. From left to right: Anthonia Carter, Gunnar Eastep, and Ayla McCay These few programs are only the tip of the iceberg. Yet other programs are financed by private trusts to encourage traditionally marginalized groups to participate in specific fields, and others include on-campus research programs sponsored by multiple organizations from various backgrounds. In addition to strengthening recipients\u2019 resumes, many of these programs also connect participants with their alumni networks, adding an additional level of value with professional connections. Depending on a student\u2019s major and interests, one or several of these programs may be a fit. But one thing is consistent across all of these offerings: the application process is rigorous. Writing essays, securing recommendation letters, and, if necessary, preparing for interviews is time-consuming, and requires long-term hard work and focus. Although the payoff is great, there is a significant time commitment involved in getting there. RESEARCH Recipients of the Goldwater Scholarship like Eastep receive a set amount of money each year to put towards books, living expenses, tuition, and other fees. Although Eastep believes he would be pursuing a very similar course of study and research if he had not been chosen, he calls the scholarship a big confidence boost. \u201CBeing awarded the Goldwater scholarship has been immensely gratifying considering how long I\u2019ve been working as a student researcher,\u201D he says. \u201CIt\u2019s definitely a massive boon to my career prospects, and particularly graduate applications.\u201D Senior neuroscience student Jasmin Revanna Other students benefit from the research opportunities afforded by fellowships rather than scholarships. One such program is the Amgen Scholars U.S. Program, which provides summer research opportunities at one of 10 universities around the country. Funded by the Amgen Foundation, this program connects participants from all over the world while also allowing them to undertake a rigorous research program under different faculty. Senior neuroscience student Jasmin Revanna attended the 2017 session at Caltech, and used her time in the fellowship to optimize a genetic editing tool to activate and deactivate targeted genes in nematodes. Each of the Amgen schools has an individual application process. In addition to the traditional personal statements, transcripts, and letters of recommendation, Caltech also requires applicants to identify a researcher and work with them to write a research proposal for their time in the program, says Revanna. \u201CThis takes a lot of communicating back and forth, so starting early is always recommended.\u201D To continue her 2017 research, she applied to the 2018 WAVE Fellows Program at Caltech. This fellowship is designed to open the school\u2019s research resources to demographics that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, and Revanna applied in hopes of returning to the same lab to test the system she\u2019d built the summer before. Though her research focus ended up being different\u2014there, she built more than 100 tools for the public to use to study the role of specific neurotransmitters in nematodes\u2014she feels that both experiences were extremely valuable. \u201CThese fellowships helped me discover what I want to do after graduation, which is go to graduate school,\u201D she says. Revanna continues that these two fellowships have given her the confidence to apply to high caliber graduate programs to further her studies. But she\u2019s not limiting herself to only one possibility: Revanna is also currently applying for a Fulbright fellowship to do research abroad. INTERNATIONAL\/GLOBAL The Fulbright fellowship is arguably one of the most recognizable fellowship programs in the world. They award approximately 1,900 grants annually to students and recent graduates who want to do projects to study culture or science or to teach abroad. In 2018, six UAB students received the honor. Sarah Faulkner, who graduated in 2017 with bachelor\u2019s degrees in art with a concentration in art history and sociology, applied to the program to study the textile art of the Lepcha, a cultural group indigenous to Sikkim, India. During her time abroad, Faulkner will research and compile a record of the Lepcha\u2019s crafts, study the local language, and begin studying local Buddhist art. \u201CDue to both their integration with daily life and the history associated with them, Lepcha textiles represent a vibrant, fundamental facet of Lepcha heritage,\u201D she says. \u201CI aim to highlight both Lepcha culture and their arts, which go hand-in-hand. I hope to also learn more about the Lepcha\u2019s folklore, performative arts, and language, which is an essential factor of the Lepcha identity.\u201D WHERE ARE THEY NOW? CATCHING UP WITH A FEW ALUMS MUNA AL-SAFARJALANI Class of 2017 Muna Al-Safarjalani graduated in 2017 with a degree in chemistry. She is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of California San Francisco School of Pharmacy. REBECCA EGELAND Class of 2015 After graduating with a degree in communication studies in 2015, Rebecca Egeland joined the Southern Company as a research communication specialist on the Research and Development Team. She also has a budding music career. In her free time, she\u2019s a singer-songwriter, and can often be found at an open mic or playing a local venue with a ukulele in hand. BRENDAN RICE Class of 2012 Brendan Rice graduated with a degree in international studies in 2012 and he is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in sustainable international agriculture at the University of G?ttingen (Germany) as a Fulbright Scholar. Prior to this, Rice worked for the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in Sierra Leone and Italy. He also worked in Uganda with smallholder farmers to promote food security. ALI MASSOUD Class of 2017 Massoud graduated in 2017 with a degree in international studies. He currently works with CAIR Alabama (Council on American-Islamic Relations) as a government affairs coordinator, where he is charged with educating and engaging voters for increased civic participation. Faulkner says she worked on her application every day for about four months. Though the process was rigorous, it was made easier because she had a clear idea of what she wanted to do. \u201CEven so, I must have gone through at least three dozen drafts of my essays, which included a personal statement and a rather detailed outline of my research objectives and methods,\u201D she says. \u201CYou have to think in concrete terms and explain your plan and purpose unambiguously,\u201D she continues. \u201CThe only advice I have for that is just to be well-read on the area you plan to stay in and culture you intend to study, your research, and other similar projects that could serve as guides for your own. I personally took inspiration from the work already being done by various government-sponsored institutes across India to preserve the country\u2019s traditional arts and the methodology of the cataloging work that I had done in the past as an undergraduate.\u201D Another federally funded program open to about 600 students each year is the Critical Language Scholarship Program. Students who receive this scholarship undergo an eight-week language immersion in a language important to national security and economic prosperity. At the same time, students are also learning about and living in the culture they\u2019ve studied to enhance their understanding. For UAB Honors College Global Community Leadership program student Ayla McCay, the scholarship enabled her to study Korean as part of her goal to work in international human rights. The application process, she says, was straightforward, but the impact the program had on her future plans was unexpected. \u201CAs a student from a low-income background, I never thought that studying abroad would be an option,\u201D she says. \u201CBecause of CLS and the help of our fellowship office, my life is going in a direction I never thought would be possible.\u201D All of the students are shepherded through the application and selection process by Ashley Floyd Kuntz, Ph.D., fellowships director and assistant professor in the UAB Honors College. Dr. Kuntz says that all of the students applying for fellowships and scholarships, regardless of whether they are members of the Honors College or not, have a tremendous support system around them\u2014one that goes all the way to the top. \"We are fortunate to have the strong support of President Watts,\" she says. \"Dr. Watts makes time each fall to meet with nominees and learn about the projects they\u2019re proposing. He advises students to be themselves, even when facing intimidating interview panels, and he encourages students to believe in their potential to compete at the highest levels. Few university presidents take such a sincere interest in getting to know students and celebrating their successes.\" POST-GRADUATE Some of these programs support recent grads\u2019 graduate studies. Anthonia Carter, who graduated with degrees in mathematics and art, applied for and received the Fulbright Study\/Research grant to pursue a degree in multidisciplinary innovation at Northumbria University in the United Kingdom. The application process was pretty standard, she says. \u201CI chose to pursue this because I come from a multidisciplinary background of mathematics and art. I\u2019m passionate about giving back and teaching kids that anyone is capable of learning and giving them the confidence to learn.\u201D The hardest part, she continues, was opening up to write her personal statement. \u201CThe easiest thing to do is to talk about my academic background. It was harder to open up and let them see what motivates me\u2014to tell them that I was raised by a single mom who said that if I didn\u2019t do well, she wouldn\u2019t pay for college.\u201D During her time in the program, she has learned a lot about identifying and solving organizational, systemic, and creative problems in many industries. All of this, she says, is in preparation to get her Ph.D., and to one day open a youth-focused community center. CHANGED LIVES For some of these students, the award has only solidified their future plans. But for a few of them, this experience has completely changed the trajectory of their lives. \u201CMy time in Korea has definitely changed my plans for the future,\u201D McCay says. \u201C[While] applying for CLS, I thought that Korean language and culture would only be a small part of my career going forward with international human rights. Now, I cannot see a future that does not involve going back to Korea.\u201D Read more... The science and philosophy of Aquaman With the latest Justice League movie coming to theaters this Christmas, we ask: what does Aquaman represent? And could he really talk to sea creatures? With the latest Justice League movie coming to theaters this Christmas, we ask: what does Aquaman represent? And could he really talk to sea creatures? Faculty in the College of Arts & Sciences weigh in. by Julie Keith Half-human, half-Atlantean, Aquaman has never been as famous or beloved as his fellow DC Justice Leaguers Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. His powers never seemed as impressive as theirs, and for a few decades, he was hard to take seriously, thanks to his presence on 1970s television shows, \u201DSuperfriends,\u201D and \u201DMan from Atlantis,\u201D where Patrick Duffy's performance inspired little more than a new, funny way for kids to swim at the neighborhood pool. But a new, big budget movie will be in theaters this Christmas, capitalizing on the Marvel\/DC superhero zeitgeist and aspiring to elevate Aquaman to the realm of the truly heroic. While the Comic-Con crowd is carefully watching every trailer\u2014and posting their criticisms and enthusiasms online\u2014faculty members in the College are examining ideas and theories that connect to Aquaman's story in fascinating ways. Why do we remain so interested in these superhero stories? What is it that ensures their popularity 70 years after they first appeared in WWII-era comic books? What does science tell us about underwater communication and navigation? Can we ever learn to \u201Dtalk\u201D to whales and dolphins? An Ear for It Dr. Winston Lancaster, assistant professor in the Department of Biology.While Aquaman can communicate with all manner of marine life, Dr. Winston Lancaster, assistant professor in the Department of Biology, says the reality is much more complex. \u201DFirst of all, things sound very differently underwater,\u201D he says. \u201DSound travels more than three times faster in water, and that speed makes it very hard to know where sounds are coming from.\u201D \u201DThink about being at the lake, how you can hear boats underwater even if you can't see them on the surface,\u201D he explains. \u201DBut under the surface you can't tell where they are or if they're coming toward you or away from you. Directionality is very different underwater, and that's because the sound travels so much faster.\u201D Lancaster, whose degrees are in zoology, geology, and human anatomy, studies the structure and function of the ears of marine mammals. A teaching faculty member at UAB responsible for all sections of human anatomy (a course taken by more than 900 students each year, he points out), Lancaster pursues his research curiosities via the lab of a former colleague who studies calling and hearing in dolphins. \u201DIt's hard enough to study small marine mammals that can be moved to a tank, much less large ones,\u201D he says. \u201DIt's virtually impossible, in fact. So, we're applying an engineering technique called finite element analysis to build a model of how we think these animals hear.\u201D Among marine mammals, the larger whales are sensitive to low frequencies, Lancaster says. They can hear over very long distances, because low-frequency sound waves travel farther than high-frequency ones. \u201DThese frequencies are lower than 25 hertz, which is about the same as the lowest A on a piano keyboard,\u201D he says. \u201DWhat's fascinating is those sound waves are so low that they're actually three times longer than the length of the entire body of a blue whale. The question is, if the ear is small and located just up at the whale's head, how can it hear that entire sound wave?\u201D Conversely, smaller marine mammals hear high-frequency sounds, which they also use to echolocate. \u201DThey emit sounds and then listen to the bounce-back,\u201D Lancaster says. \u201DThat's really good for directionality, but those higher-frequency waves can only travel over short distances.\u201D Big whales, on the other hand, cannot echolocate at all. Regardless of the type of hearing these marine animals use, Lancaster says, \u201DThey live in a world of sound. Visual orientation is severely limited, since below about 200 feet there is almost no light at all.\u201D \u201DThe whale ear is basically unchanged since these mammals returned to the sea 40 million years ago,\u201D he continues, pointing out that different marine mammals have different ear structures. If you look at high-resolution scans of whales, the ear bones are very easy to see because they're so dense. But the soft tissues of muscle, fat, and cartilage are much harder to see on the scans. Dolphins' inner ears are suspended in these fatty, fleshy tissues and are not connected to the skull by other bones. That isolation cuts down on sound vibration in their heads, which improves their sense of directionality. Whereas large whales' inner ears are connected bone-to-bone, useful for an animal using low frequency sounds and no echolocation. Which brings us back to Aquaman. \u201DHow would he communicate?\u201D Lancaster asks, genuinely puzzling over the question. \u201DHe would need to be able to hear the lower frequencies so he could talk to the big whales. But he'd also need the ears of smaller whales so he could echolocate with them, which is a completely different anatomy. I'm not saying it's not possible, it's just curious to think about.\u201D I Need a Hero Meanwhile, Dr. Matt King, assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy, teaches smaller classes of students who sign up for his \u201DPhilosophy and Superheroes\u201D course. It's a class he invented at UAB and will be teaching for the third time this fall. \u201DPhilosophy is considered a 'discovery major,' meaning students' first exposure is in college,\u201D King explains. \u201DAnd since there's no accurate representation of philosophy in popular culture, this seemed like a good way to teach it. Superheroes are ubiquitous, and the worlds they inhabit are easy to co-opt as a familiar context and use to teach an unfamiliar discipline. It's simply a framework for discussing philosophical ideas.\u201D Matt King, assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy.Unlike Lancaster's course, a prerequisite for all pre-health majors, King's is a special topics class and is open to anyone. (\u201DIt requires no pre-requisites either way, neither superheroes nor philosophy,\u201D he says.) The course has clearly established pedagogical goals: to get students excited about philosophy, and to teach the fundamentals of the discipline. \u201DI update the course each time, engaging with more recent movies,\u201D he says. \u201DBut it always starts with moral philosophy and expands from there. We're looking at the decisions these superheroes make and their rationale for it. And these thought experiments are fairly easy to do with comic book characters. They've been tweaked so many times, yet it doesn't confuse the myth or undermine the character in any fundamental way. Which in itself is an interesting question of fictional truths.\u201D For example, King's students examine the role of state authority, public accountability, and the obligations we have as individuals to serve our own interests versus others' via the 2016 film, \"Captain America: Civil War.\" In the Spider-Man myth, teenager Peter Parker initially hesitates to use his new superpowers to help others. That resistance ultimately contributes to the death of Parker's beloved Uncle Ben. Parker, consumed with guilt, adopts the mantra, \u201Dwith great power comes great responsibility,\u201D and assumes the role of Spider-Man. \u201DPhilosophy has a similar principle,\u201D King says. \u201D'If you can help, you should help.' But you can see the complications that suggests. Take Superman: he doesn't have to eat or sleep, so he's always available to anyone who needs help, all over the world. So, can Superman have friends? Is this obligation to help fair to Spider-Man and Superman?\u201D Additionally, the Superman story allows students to consider the idea of how names and identity are connected\u2014or aren't\u2014a philosophy explored in depth by John Stuart Mill in the 19th century. Mill considered the two names the ancient Greeks had for the planet Venus: the god Phosphorus (the Morning Star), and the god Hesperus (the Evening Star). Can we use two names for the same thing? \u201DThink about it this way: Lois Lane would never want to have lunch with Clark Kent, but she would love to go to dinner with Superman,\u201D King says. \u201DWe can understand that. But aren't they just two names for the same person? What is it about one that is different from the other? How can we hold these different identities in our minds while still understanding they are one and the same person?\u201D While King mostly teaches ethics courses, \"Philosophy and Superheroes\" allows him to explore many philosophical ideas, such as our sense of self. \u201DWe really think about ourselves as having two identities: the psychological and the physical,\u201D he says. \u201DWe know we can change physical things about a person without changing who they are, while psychological changes are more fundamental to a person's identity. What we call dementia today is often presented as body-switching in fiction. And these kinds of schisms between the mind and body in superheroes are interesting to explore.\u201D \u201DIn the Wolverine story, he has his memory wiped more than once over his long lifespan,\u201D King says. \u201DThat makes his psychology different. So I ask my students, 'Should Wolverine feel guilt about the bad things he did in the past but he doesn't remember doing?'\u201D When it comes to Aquaman, King refers to another classic philosophical text, \u201DWhat Is It Like to Be a Bat?\u201D written in the 1970s by Thomas Nagel. \u201DThe article examines the idea that we can't really know what it's like to be a bat, because we can't echolocate,\u201D King says. \u201DThere's been some recent pushback on that\u2014some science has shown that humans can do a sort of proto-location. But the question remains as to whether we can really understand it or represent it and other powers and experiences in film or comic books. Daredevil is blind but can echolocate. How do you depict this from a viewer's standpoint? It's not like dogs and bees, which have eyes but see differently from humans. How does Ant-Man control ants? How does Aquaman talk to fish and whales? Can they really have the same thoughts?\u201D (Not Entirely) Suspending Disbelief But \"Aquaman\" is just a movie, right? A bit of escapist fun that allows us to enter a fictional world that's radically different from our own\u2014a story chock-full of bad guys, big climactic battles, and the charismatic, heroic figure (and his or her sidekick) that saves humanity at the end. It is that. It's why we'll pay too much for the tickets and the concessions and participate in the cultural moment. But maybe in the car on the way home, or in the days after you see the movie, think about our research areas, and how our faculty are using these contemporary myths to teach in innovative ways. It's the interdisciplinary strength of the College of Arts and Sciences, where the empirical science of whale ears lives right alongside the mind\/body divide symbolized by The Hulk. How can we accept this tattooed, long-haired, Polynesian-version of the superhero as \u201Dreal\u201D when there have been so many other versions before? Can Aquaman really communicate with marine life? And what does it say about us that we, for a few hours anyway, believe that he can? Worth pondering at your local multiplex this December.

Common threads: The value of interdisciplinary partnerships Our university enables faculty to make connections across various disciplines, schools, and centers, and being a part of the College of Arts and Sciences provides my colleagues and me with a broad platform to support this kind of effective interdisciplinary work. Our university enables faculty to make connections across various disciplines, schools, and centers, and being a part of the College of Arts and Sciences provides my colleagues and me with a broad platform to support this kind of effective interdisciplinary work. Even in the short time I've been at UAB, I have developed three interdisciplinary courses that have service learning goals and ongoing research endeavors. By working with willing faculty members from the Departments of History and Art and Art History, we developed a \"Birmingham Neighborhood Studies\" course that involves student examination of four specific Birmingham Neighborhoods from a historical perspective, a contemporary perspective, and an artistic perspective. In that course, students complete a project-based final portfolio. Their projects range from architectural histories of places to walking tours of women buried in Oak Hill cemetery. This year, in a joint effort between the Departments of Social Work and Criminal Justice, we have enhanced an existing \"Community-Based Corrections\" course\u2014making it interdisciplinary and including both team-based learning and service learning elements. Students in the course participate in re-entry simulations in which they experience what it is like to be a person returning to the community after a period of incarceration. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office developed this curriculum and the Department of Social Work has taken a lead role in bringing the simulations to our campus. Last year, we received a Quality Enhancement Plan grant to continue the simulations and to conduct research around their effectiveness. Students also work with women incarcerated at Tutwiler Prison and Birmingham Work Release to produce holiday greeting videos for their families, as well as with Jefferson County Veterans Court to recruit veteran volunteers to support court efforts. Last year, I developed a study abroad course that examines women\u2019s rights and health in Kenya. This year, the social work course will be team-taught with Dr. Tina Kempin-Reuter, director of the UAB Institute for Human Rights, and will involve international service learning in which students create health-based lesson plans and assemble reusable feminine hygiene supplies that they deliver in rural Kenya. Since last year\u2019s successful trip with 12 students, we have written a grant to support the continuation of the women\u2019s hygiene project and the addition of a micro-business sewing initiative. All of these efforts will be evaluated through community partners in Kenya. The common thread through all of these courses are that they all involve social work principles that advance human rights as well as social, economic, and environmental justice. And they are all led by female faculty and directors from across the College. As service learning is considered a high-impact learning tool, these courses are expected to strengthen student learning and engagement in multiple ways outside of the course content. And just as women are leading the efforts to craft these high-impact courses, women are benefitting from them as participants\u2014as student and as community collaborators. Read more... The Life-Long Learning Endowed Scholarship Honoring Ruth J. and Robert J. Colvin The Life-Long Learning Endowed Scholarship Honoring Ruth J. and Robert J. Colvin has been established in the departments of English and World Languages and Literatures that will support deserving students and relieve them of their financial pressures. Honoring literacy advocate Ruth J. Colvin and her husband Robert The Life-Long Learning Endowed Scholarship Honoring Ruth J. and Robert J. Colvin has been established in the departments of English and World Languages and Literatures that will support deserving students and relieve them of their financial pressures. The scholarship is named in honor of Ruth J. and Robert J. Colvin to recognize their commitment to education and their impact on improving communication and understanding among people worldwide. Ruth J. Colvin was born in Chicago in 1916 and earned her associate\u2019s degree from Thornton Junior College in Harvey, Illinois, before obtaining her bachelor\u2019s degree from Syracuse University. After reading census reports in 1961, Colvin learned about the serious illiteracy problem across the country, including in Syracuse. Catalyzed into action, Colvin began an effort to transform education and its impact on literacy for adults. With an innovative focus on community networks that empowered adult learners in new ways, Colvin founded and served as the first president and life board member of Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. (LVA), an organization that trained and developed volunteers to teach basic adult literacy and English to speakers of other languages through one-on-one interactions or small groups. In 2002, LVA and Laubauch Literacy International merged to form what is formally known as ProLiteracy, a nonprofit organization that supports programs that help adults learn to read and write. Over the decades, Colvin, along with her husband Robert, visited and worked in more than 60 countries. She has received numerous honors and awards including the U.S.A. President\u2019s Volunteer Action Award in 1987, induction into the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame in 1991, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2006. This scholarship will ensure that the Colvins' impact on education continues, as it will ensure financial security for College of Arts and Sciences students pursuing degrees in English and world languages.

Computer science meets the biological sciences in the new bioinformatics program New degrees in the College prepare students for emerging fields of personalized medicine, advanced manufacturing, and more. New degrees in the College prepare students for emerging fields of personalized medicine, advanced manufacturing, and more. By Cary Estes It is an image that goes along with almost any story about the history of the computer. One or two people are in front of this clunky-looking machine that is as big as a suitcase (or a refrigerator, depending upon the decade). As the processing gears slowly dribble out the data, the person dutifully records the information using the ultimate low-tech device: pen and paper. This, in essence, was data gathering at the dawn of the computer age. All you needed was a notebook, and maybe a calculator when things got complex. The information superhighway was still merely a footpath, and everything moved at a moderate pace. Obviously, that no longer is the case. We don\u2019t have a river of data these days. We have Niagara Falls, constantly drenching us with bits and bytes and more knowledge than we\u2019ve ever had. And in many ways, more than we can handle. Yuliang Zheng, chair, Department of Computer Science.Computer Science Meets the Biological Sciences \u201CEverything is centered around data now,\u201D says Yuliang Zheng. Ph.D., chair of the Department of Computer Science. \u201CWhat is the best way to collect data? How do you organize it? How do you analyze it? How do you make sense of it? Then, how do you turn that data into something useful, whether that means making money or saving lives? There are skills that are required to go through all these different steps.\u201D The College of Arts and Sciences is helping students learn these steps with the introduction of a new undergraduate degree in bioinformatics, which focuses on complex biological data such as genetic codes. The new program is a result of a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science, the Department of Biology and the UAB School of Medicine, and is the first of its kind in the state of Alabama. In addition, the Department of Computer Science has also introduced a new master\u2019s in data science, which is designed to prepare students with skills they can apply to careers in big data, including machine learning; modeling, analysis, and management of data sets; and efficient, algorithmic-based problem solving. For undergraduates, the focus is on the intersection of computer science and the biological sciences. \u201CThe idea is that all the new genomics and proteomics\u2014basically the new form of medicine that is going to take over in the next 20 years\u2014is going to be hugely data-intensive,\u201D says Steven Austad, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Biology. \u201CEverybody is going to have their genome on file. It\u2019s going to be a massive data organization and analysis. \u201CThis degree is designed to get people trained in biology to be able to recognize the data, trained in computer science to be able to write software to evaluate the data, and then trained in bioinformatics to organize the data. So this is going to train people in a lot of things that are going to be incredibly useful.\u201D It is a rigorous curriculum, with multiple class requirements involving mathematics, computer science, biology, chemistry, genetics, and engineering. The end result will be graduates who are well-positioned for careers in the emerging data-based workforce in medicine and other fields. John Johnstone, co-director of the bioinformatics program.\u201CScience in general is becoming team-oriented and interdisciplinary. This is a great example of that, with so many different disciplines involved,\u201D says John Johnstone, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and co-director of the bioinformatics program. \u201CIt\u2019s an elite program for an elite student. It\u2019s challenging, but there are a lot of opportunities for a person who can do it right. There is a lot of demand for this, and not enough people who understand it.\u201D Data collection and analysis already is widely used in everyday life, from genetic testing companies such as 23andMe, to the cameras and other electronic devices in new cars, to the responses generated by virtual assistants Siri and Alexa. Much of the interest at UAB likely will involve the medical field, including the use of data in creating disease treatment options specifically tailored for individual patients. \u201CBioinformatics is the same as working with any huge data set, except now the data set is the human genome,\u201D Johnstone says. \u201CYou are gleaning information computationally from that data, and you can tune your medical treatment based on this analysis. It\u2019s a very exciting, cutting-edge direction.\u201D The Future of Healthcare The university took an initial step in that direction in 2017 with the hiring of computer scientist Matt Might, Ph.D., as the inaugural director of the Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute. Simply put, the goal is to create personalized medical diagnosis and treatments based on the genomic data derived from each individual patient, which is analyzed by data scientists. Steven Austad, chair, Department of Biology.\u201CRight now, we sort of treat everybody the same. You get a certain diagnosis, and a certain treatment for that diagnosis,\u201D Austad says. \u201CThat is about to change, and the reason is there\u2019s this data that\u2019s going to be available. That\u2019s what this is all ultimately about, understanding what makes you an individual and how medical diagnosis and treatment will work on you as opposed to somebody else. \u201CThis can be done because your doctor is going to have access to your entire genome. The problem is, your doctor is probably not going to understand what it means. So they are going to need people who do understand it and can produce it in some sort of interpretable fashion. That\u2019s where bioinformatics comes in. It\u2019s not enough just to know all the computer stuff. You also need to know all the underlying biology.\u201D That is exactly what the College's new bioinformatics degree will provide. Computer science students have been learning how to use computation-thinking techniques to gather data for years, and medical students obviously have long had an understanding of human biology. The bioinformatics program will combine those two skill sets. \u201CHaving that cross-disciplinary training is going to create people who can straddle the fence and have one foot in the biology and the medical aspects of the problem being addressed, and the other foot in the analytic techniques that can be applied to that,\u201D says James Cimino, M.D., director of the Informatics Institute in the School of Medicine. \u201CWe have a lot of medical researchers who have data, and they\u2019re at a loss as to what to do with it. They know the biology, and suddenly they have a new way to collect biological data, but they have not been trained on how to interpret this data. So there\u2019s a big demand for people to work in either a support role or a collaborative role to do that. There\u2019s not nearly enough trained people right now to meet the demand.\u201D Elliot Leftkovitz, co-director of the bioinformatics program.Graduates of the UAB bioinformatics program will have the skills needed for a variety of academic research positions, as well as government jobs involving epidemiology (through the Centers for Disease Control) and drug development (through the Food and Drug Administration). Pharmaceutical companies also need employees who are capable of analyzing data to identify genetic targets that can help in drug development. \u201CFor example, say you find that a particular genetic variant keeps popping up in one individual gene in patients' associated with a specific disease. Now you have a gene that might be targeted by a therapeutic drug based upon the discovery,\u201D says Elliot Lefkowitz, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Microbiology and co-director of the bioinformatics program. \u201CThat discovery is derived from the massive amounts of data that clinical studies have provided, and companies need bioinformaticians to help them sort through that data.\u201D College of Arts and Sciences Dean Robert Palazzo, Ph.D., who is also a cell biologist, elaborates. \u201CImagine that an analysis of a simple blood sample indicates that a specific profile of tumor enzymes not normally found in the blood stream are elevated,\u201C he says. \u201CAfter a series of tests and biopsies, scientists can sequence the gene\u2014highlighting a new, never-before-seen protein mutation that is leading to the tumor growth. Since the patient is the first with such a mutation, no information is available on potential drug treatments. Bioinformatics helps to identify a specific target site on the protein for the generation of novel drugs to create a totally new approach. All of this, and much more, is possible through the application of bioinformatics' computational and analytical technologies.\u201C Attracting Students Austad says he received a \u201Ctremendous amount of interest\u201D in the program when he talked with prospective students this past summer. He noted that since today\u2019s college-bound medical students grew up with computers as part of their daily life, the concept of bioinformatics does not seem as daunting to many of them. \u201CStudents who might be interested in medical school but are also interested in computers, suddenly they realize that their two passions can be combined into a single major,\u201D Austad says. \u201CWe think this is going to be a great recruiting tool to bring some really top students to UAB. This major is going to be so sellable because of the huge demand in the industry. Our graduates will walk out of here and into some really high-paying jobs.\u201D Jobs that will not necessarily be in the medical field. Because as Zheng points out, \u201CThings are changing so fast, there will soon be opportunities in jobs that haven\u2019t even been created yet. The future will be driven by data in every field. It\u2019s all about the data.\u201D Read More: UAB launches new master\u2019s in data science program Read more... Dr. Mike Wilson and Professor Becky Trigg Endowed Award Friends, family, colleagues, and admirers of Dr. Michele \u201CMike\u201D Wilson and Professor Becky Trigg have made generous gifts to create an endowed award in the Department of Sociology. Friends, family, colleagues, and admirers of Dr. Michele \u201CMike\u201D Wilson and Professor Becky Trigg have made generous gifts to create an endowed award in the Department of Sociology. The scholarship will be used to provide financial assistance to students in the Women\u2019s and Gender Studies Program. The endowment honors Dr. Mike Wilson and commemorates Professor Becky Trigg for their dedication and commitment to improve the lives of women. Dr. Wilson was born in Puerto Rico in 1942 and earned her doctoral degree from the University of Connecticut in 1978. Ms. Trigg was born in Hueytown, Alabama in 1955, and received her master\u2019s degree from The University of Alabama in 1983. Both women were members of the Southern Sociological Society and were dedicated and committed in working toward women's equality. Dr. Wilson and Professor Trigg have received various honors and awards throughout their careers including the 2006 President\u2019s Diversity Award from the UAB Women\u2019s Studies Program, given to Dr. Wilson, and the 2007 IMPACT award from Sociology students honoring her for her teaching and mentoring activities, given to Professor Trigg. Trigg passed away November 2, 2010, and is remembered for the courage of her convictions and her integrity, empathy, fairness, and motivation of others to be their best. This scholarship memorializes her contributions and will support the Women\u2019s and Gender Studies Program as it continues to mentor undergraduate and graduate students, and inspire students to apply their knowledge to improve the lives of others.

A servant's heart: Social Work alumna Jeanne Welch gives back to UAB Jeanne Welch never really saw herself as college material. But a desire to help others, and an interest in mental health technology, helped her find her way to UAB. Jeanne Welch never really saw herself as college material. Growing up in an Air Force family, she moved a lot growing up. While she learned to be outgoing and adaptable, she never expected to go to college. But a desire to help others, and an interest in mental health technology, helped her find her way to UAB. WORK FIRST, THEN SCHOOL After graduating from high school, Welch first pursued a general studies degree and completed a year of coursework at a community college. Then she completed some additional mental health training, always with the drive to serve those in need. \u201DI was interested in helping people achieve their life goals,\u201D she says. She was hired as a houseparent with what was then UAB's transitional home for individuals leaving state mental hospitals, a job she says was a good fit.\u201D I was working in my area of interest and my area of education,\u201D she says. \u201DBut I still wasn't thinking about college.\u201D But a conversation with a work acquaintance changed her thinking and helped her connect the dots. \u201DShe was a Bachelor of Social Work student at UAB, and she pointed out to me that what I was already doing in my job was social work,\u201D Welch says. \u201DSo I decided to learn more about the program and see if I could strengthen my education and training.\u201D A CRITICAL CONVERSATION Welch made an appointment with Dr. Norman Eggleston, then-chair of the Department of Social Work, and his advice proved to be transformative. \u201DOriginally my idea was a two-year degree,\u201D Welch says, \u201Dbut Dr. Eggleston convinced me that a four-year degree would give me more independence and flexibility.\u201D Welch had a firm timeline in mind: She had to graduate in the spring of 1980 while still working fulltime. But with the help of Dr. Eggleston and Welch's faculty advisor Dr. Gail Wykle, she was able to find a way. \u201DI mapped out the whole plan based on what classes were taught in the daytime or at night,\u201D she says. With a plan in place and a deadline looming, Welch jumped into her classes with energy and enthusiasm. \u201DBeing able to stop by and meet with faculty after classes was so helpful,\u201D Welch says. \u201DThe investment they made in me was significant and meaningful; they would ask me how things were going, and they wanted to know not just in my classes, but in my job, too.\u201D \"Knowing that you know how to help someone and how to provide services to them is so rewarding.\" NEXT STEPS With Dr. Eggleston's encouragement, Welch once again expanded her educational expectations and decided to apply for graduate school. \u201DI thought I was done at the four-year degree, but Dr. Eggleston started planting seeds that I could and should continue my education and training,\u201D she says. \u201DI still have the recommendation letters from Dr. Eggleston, Tom Kemp, and Gail Wykle. They could see the potential in me, even when I didn't see it in myself.\u201D With the department fully behind her, Welch applied and was accepted to the graduate social work program at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201DIt was a one-year advanced-standing program,\u201D she says. \u201DMost students had to have good grades and work experience. But when I graduated with my BSW, I couldn't [walk at commencement] because I had less than 24 hours to get to graduate school!\u201D A MEANINGFUL CAREER After graduating in June 1981, Welch started her first job as a social worker. After a year working with developmentally disabled adults, she landed at one of Virginia's Community Services Boards, which provides community mental health therapy to outpatients. \u201DThat was the beginning of a 15-year career with the Service Boards,\u201D Welch says. \u201DAs a licensed clinical social worker, I gained both clinical and administrative experience as we counseled patients dealing with depression, sexual abuse, relationship problems, and more.\u201D She admits that while her role was often emotionally and psychologically challenging, she was able to stave off burnout by relying on her training and focusing on the positive outcomes. \u201DKnowing that you know how to help someone and how to provide services to them is so rewarding,\u201D she says. \u201DAnd seeing them progress as a result of your help is so gratifying and satisfying. You know you're making a difference. \u201DYou have to know which challenges are worth investing in and which ones to leave alone,\u201D she adds. \u201DYou have to know what you can control. You can focus on what's tough, or you can decide to go into that room with that person and offer the best you have, knowing that this will pass. And it always did.\u201D Welch, who just recently retired, spent the last 11 years of her career as a clinical social worker at the Salem VA Medical Center in Salem, Virginia. \u201DBeing raised in an Air Force family, I knew the sacrifices that the veterans and their families had made. That was something I brought to the table. Veterans like being treated by people who can relate to them\u2014they like that feeling of kinship. I felt like my life had come full circle.\u201D MAKE A PLANNED GIFT Jeanne Welch and Jay Rule endowed their scholarship by way of a planned gift\u2014a very flexible and popular choice for donors. There are many ways to make a planned gift, including legacy gifts (wills, trusts, real estate, and more); gifts that generate income (charitable gift annuities); stock transfers; and other options. To learn more about how you can contribute from your estate, contact: Kimberley S. Coppock, J.D. Director of Development Office of Planned Giving kcoppock@uab.edu (205) 975-5970 STILL HELPING OTHERS Welch found herself thinking of UAB and Dr. Eggleston when she and her husband Jay Rule, a mechanical engineer, were preparing a will several years ago. \u201DWe were thinking a lot about what has impacted our lives the most, and how to give back. And I immediately thought of UAB.\u201D Welch says that her connection to Dr. Eggleston went beyond his academic and professional advice. \u201DHe was the only person I knew in Birmingham who was from Virginia, like I was,\u201D she says. \u201DAnd as I learned a little about his life history\u2014how he was raised in foster care and how social workers had such a positive impact on him\u2014it motivated me to continue my social work training. \u201DDr. Eggleston told me I could achieve anything I put my mind to,\u201D she continues. \u201DI didn't enroll at UAB with that in my mind, but that gave me that confidence. So when Jay and I were ready to make a gift\u2014and I couldn't do any of this without Jay\u2014I had the opportunity to finish funding the scholarship that had already been established in Dr. Eggleston's name.\u201D Welch says in hindsight, she can see how events worked in her favor. \u201CIf I hadn't met the social work student, I would've never considered a social work degree,\u201D she says. \u201DIf I hadn't met Dr. Eggleston, I wouldn't have pursued my undergraduate and graduate degrees. And if not for those conversations, I wouldn't be in a position to give back today. I also received some financial assistance when I was a student. I want to do what I can to help today's students discover their own untapped, unrealized potential.\u201D Read more... Dr. Larry Krannich Endowed Student Research Scholarship The Dr. Larry Krannich Endowed Student Research Scholarship was established to recognize Dr. Krannich's decades of distinguished service to UAB and to provide opportunities for young scientists to gain valuable experience in the research environment. The Dr. Larry Krannich Endowed Student Research Scholarship was established to recognize Dr. Krannich's decades of distinguished service to UAB and to provide opportunities for young scientists to gain valuable experience in the research environment. Dr. Larry Krannich was chair of the UAB Department of Chemistry from 1976- 2003. By emphasizing the first two years of instruction, he established a tradition of engaging students in the classroom and the laboratory. As many former students and colleagues have attested, he brought active learning strategies into the classroom, which in turn led to a significant increase in the number of students majoring in chemistry. \u201DDr. Larry Krannich was an outstanding chair of the UAB Chemistry Department for 27 years,\u201D says Charles L. Watkins, Ph.D., retired professor of chemistry and associate dean of the former School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. \u201DDuring his tenure, he catalyzed the growth and development of the department through strategic planning and implementation of critical initiatives, always with faculty involvement. Under his leadership, the department became nationally recognized.\u201D Today, Dr. Krannich's teaching model has resulted in tremendous student success, with chemistry majors earning national recognition from the Barry Goldwater Scholarship, the DAAD Research Internships in Science and Engineering (DAAD-RISE), Amgen Scholars, and the American Chemical Society Scholars Program. You have an opportunity to support the Department of Chemistry with a gift to the Dr. Larry Krannich Endowed Student Research Scholarship. Your support will provide the department an opportunity to build on the extraordinary foundation Dr. Krannich has helped to create. We are already well on our way to our goal of $25,000 thanks to a generous gift that allows the Department of Chemistry to double your investment with a 1:1 match up to $15,000. Read more... Letter from the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences While we have any number of outstanding male faculty members, students, and alumni who deserve recognition and are included, by and large this issue is about the women of the College of Arts and Sciences. When I was reading the Fall 2017 issue of our Arts & Sciences magazine, I was struck by how many successful women we had featured in news stories, alumni profiles, and longer features. But honestly, I wasn\u2019t surprised. Since setting a goal in our Strategic Plan to increase the percentage of women faculty we recruit\u2014as well as our commitment to attracting the very best students to our campus and better engaging with our accomplished alumni\u2014I knew that adding more women to our College would result in more achievement. So, I asked Julie Keith, our Director of Communications and editor of the magazine, to focus this Spring 2018 magazine entirely on women. While we have any number of outstanding male faculty members, students, and alumni who deserve recognition and are included, by and large this issue is about the women of the College of Arts and Sciences. From student scholarship winners, to alumnae who have excelled in their fields, to women faculty members who have built outstanding academic careers in departments and disciplines that have historically been shaped by men, this issue is filled with an array of talented and successful women. As Julie pointed out, we would have to double or triple the number of pages to truly capture all of the stories of the exceptional contributions and leadership of our women colleagues, but this issue provides a window into the much wider world of the achievements of the women of the College of Arts and Sciences. I am very proud of what we are doing at UAB, and I attribute a great deal of our success to the talent and dedication of our women colleagues\u2014including our staff. I hope you enjoy this issue and I am confident that you will share my pride in the many contributions of the women of the College of Arts and Sciences at UAB. R.E. Palazzo, Dean Read more... Events Catch up with some of the big events sponsored by the College of Arts and Sciences, from Homecoming to an exhibit at AEIVA. A Festive Fall and a Warm Winter Our Fall semester was as busy as ever and was capped off by two signature events: Homecoming Week, and the UAB Marching Blazers trip to the Bahamas Bowl to play alongside the UAB Blazers Football team. In the midst of the hectic fall schedule, it's always a joy to be able to come together as a College community to have fun and celebrate another successful semester. And to end the return of the football season with a bowl game\u2014where so many of our students participated as athletes, musicians, auxiliary, and spirit teams\u2014sent us into the holiday season with hearts bursting with pride. The 2017 Homecoming theme was Blazers United, and the College had great fun decorating the float and Heritage Hall Building, featuring Senior Associate Dean Dr. Catherine Dani?lou as Lady Liberty, and mathematics major Mary Allison Caufield as Uncle Sam. In Nassau, Blaze and the Marching Blazers entertained bowl game attendees. In early 2018, we recognized our 17 faculty members who published 18 books in 2017 at the annual One for the Books celebration, where we also honored our three first-ever winners of the Dean's Awards for Excellence in Teaching. It was another outstanding achievement by arts and sciences faculty. Faculty authors honored at the One for the Books faculty book party included Dr. Alison Chapman, chair of the Department of English, Dr. Da Yan, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, Dr. Rebecca Bach, professor in the Department of English, and Dr. Kevin McCain, assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy. Dr. Sami Raut, assistant professor in the Department of Biology, was one of the first winners of the Dean's Awards for Excellence in Teaching. Go Blazers! [widgetkit id=\"28\" name=\"MAGAZINE - Spring 2018 - Events\"] Ireland Award and AEIVA Professor Heith Copes from the Department of Criminal Justice was named the winner of the 2017 Ireland Award for Scholarly Distinction. We celebrated his recognition at a dinner at The Club, where President and Mrs. Watts, along with Dean Palazzo and Mrs. Caroline Ireland, who established the award endowment with her late husband Charles, joined Dr. Copes' colleagues and special guests. The Fall semester also meant the opening of Misremembered, the installation by artist Titus Kaphar, along with Jordan Eagles' Blood Equality exhibit, which also included pieces at the Birmingham Museum of Art and Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. Dr. Copes' work focuses on individuals who engage in both crime and drug use. Specifically, his research centers on criminal decision-making and narrative sense-making. As the Ireland selection committee noted, he is a leader in the field of narrative criminology. Kaphar appropriates different styles and techniques from past periods of art history to create reconstructive historical narratives that address issues of race throughout history. A large part of his AEIVA exhibit featured The Vesper Project, a life-sized, two-room house constructed inside the main gallery.

Building a Legacy When UAB broke ground on the new Arts & Sciences Building in September 2017, the excitement was palpable. \u201CThere is no doubt that this new building will provide our campus community with a state-of-the-art facility in which they can work and learn,\u201D said Dean Palazzo. When UAB broke ground on the new Arts & Sciences Building in September 2017, the excitement was palpable. President Watts, along with the Provost, Vice Presidents, and a number of deans and leadership from UAB Facilities, gathered with College faculty, alumni, and students to celebrate the construction of our newest and most modern campus building. \u201CThere is no doubt that this new building will provide our campus community with a state-of-the-art facility in which they can work and learn,\u201D said Dean Palazzo. Today, construction is progressing on schedule and on budget, and the L-shaped structure, which will complete the quadrant of academic, recreational, housing, and dining buildings around The Green, is now reaching its second floor. But we need your help to complete the project. Your gift to the College of Arts & Sciences Building Fund will help us ensure that we are able to continue to deliver the very best programs to our students, as well as provide the facilities that will attract the very best faculty to UAB. As Dean Palazzo has also said, \u201CNo public or private university in this day and age could possibly function, let alone thrive, without philanthropic support. For us to provide the quality education and opportunities that we provide for our students, we must have support of donors.\u201D We invite you to partner with us. There are a number of naming opportunities within the new College of Arts and Sciences Building to recognize or pay tribute to individuals or companies. In fact, we are proud that some of the earliest gifts to the building have been made by current or retired faculty members, who recognize the value of the project and want to be a part of the legacy of the College. In the College of Arts and Sciences, we are proud to tell our prospective and current students that, \u201CYour Place is Here.\u201D And we feel the same way about our alumni and donors, who are so vital to our continued success.

AEIVA Receives Significant Gift of Works by David Levinthal The Abroms-Engel Institute for the Visual Arts (AEIVA) Permanent Art Collection has received a generous donation of a number of works by David Levinthal, one of the most prolific and acclaimed photographers of his generation. The Abroms-Engel Institute for the Visual Arts (AEIVA) Permanent Art Collection has received a generous donation of a number of works by David Levinthal, one of the most prolific and acclaimed photographers of his generation. The gift includes 59 large-format Polaroids by Levinthal given to AEIVA by an anonymous collector. The donation includes images from several series by the artist spanning multiple decades, including \"Barbie\", \"American Beauties\", \"Blackface\", \"Wild West\", \"Mein Kampf\", and \"Passion\". \u201CThis is a very significant acquisition for AEIVA,\u201D said AEIVA Curator John Fields. \u201CAEIVA already houses many large-format Polaroids by several notable artists. To be able to add such a sizeable number of works by such an important artist greatly enhances the educational value of our collection. It is a remarkable privilege.\u201D Considered one of the first postmodern photographers, Levinthal uses toys and miniature figures as subjects for his images. Much of his work questions the role of photography as a reliable presentation of historical fact through intricately restaging significant moments or cultural milestones throughout history. \u201CAs children, so much of our early social development occurs through these little melodramas that we act out with our toys,\u201D says Fields. An exhibition titled David Levinthal: Playland ran Jan. 8 \u2013 March 10, 2018, featuring a number of the donated works as well as six large-format Polaroids from Levinthal\u2019s Baseball series, on loan from a private collection in Birmingham.
