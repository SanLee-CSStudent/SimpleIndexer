Encompassing almost one-third of your undergraduate curriculum, the courses of Charger Foundations will enhance your skills, expand your horizons, and encourage you to build on the core values of the Charger Nation: integrity, respect, diligence, excellence, inclusiveness, and diversity. The development of competencies associated with these values begins with Charger Foundations coursework. Below, you will see a matrix providing an overview of the competencies central to your Foundations work and aligned with the Alabama General Studies Commission (AGSC) Area Requirements. Core Competencies The University of Alabama in Huntsville is committed to four core competencies that serve as the foundation for undergraduate general education. These four core competencies follow. Effective communication (Area I) Engagement with questions of values, ethics, and aesthetics as represented in literature, the humanities, and the arts (Area II) Understanding of the scientific method and application of quantitative or inductive reasoning (Area III) Understanding of human behavior and economic, social, and political structures as represented in the disciplines of history and the social and behavioral sciences (Area IV) These core competencies are consistent with those of the State of Alabama mandated articulation agreement under ACT 94-303, which ensures the transferability of credits from the State's two-year institutions to its four-year institutions.
