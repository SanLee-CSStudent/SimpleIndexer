The 2022 Alabama State Spelling Bee will take place Saturday, March 26, at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Alabama Kiwanis Foundation is the official sponsor of the Alabama State Spelling Bee, which is also supported by Scripps as well as hundreds of schools across the state. The private event is in the UAB College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 University Hall auditorium at noon. Fifty students in fourth through eighth grades from counties across the state will participate. More than 645 schools have participated in bees, culminating with the 50 student winners who will vie for the 2022 Alabama State Spelling Bee Champion. The pronouncers are Janet Keys and John Hubbard, and judges are Armand St. Raymond, Sandra Harrell, Stephen Epley and Douglas Ragland. The winner of the Alabama State Spelling Bee will represent the state at Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C., in May, which is now annually broadcast on ION Television. Nine newspapers collaborated to start the National Spelling Bee in 1925. In 1941, Scripps took over sponsorship of the National Spelling Bee. 2020 is the only time since World War II (1943-1945) that the bee has canceled the national finals since the program\u2019s inception in 1925. In 2021 the bees were held virtually. In 2019, eight co-winners of the National Spelling Bee were declared, including Alabama student Erin Howard, 14. Scripps named two winners as recently as 2016, but the competition had not recognized more than a two-way tie since it began in 1925. Alabama has had only one other Scripps National Spelling Bee champion, Julie Junkin, in 1974. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
