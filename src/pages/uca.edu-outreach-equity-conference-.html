Sponsored by the UCA College of Education The Centering Equity Conference will influence thinking and engage participants in individual and collective action for social change. To \u2018center equity\u2019 means to focus on and create a point of action whereby fairness and justice are explicitly implemented in your personal and professional life and within your organizational structure. This will be an all-day event with afternoon breakout sessions. As a conference participant you will . . . Explore techniques and strategies that will affect the ways in which you are activating humility in yourself, your community and your organization. Build a coalition of equity and principals committed to advancing equity through transformative and corrective policies and practices. Strive toward accountability to yourself and others by confirming and responding to issues of equity that are affecting humanity on health, cultural, economic, educational and social levels. What is ALLYSHIP? Allyship: A group of individuals who actively and consistently engage in leveraging their power and privilege to address the needs of marginalized communities to ensure equity is realized. Self-identification of those who declare themselves an ally should be held to account for how they advocate and engage in activism for others. Their actions should not be performative or promote a person\u2019s ally resume but be transformed and influential. Some of the most critical points in creating an allyship with a marginalized group or person is to understand their story \u2013 how an individual can leverage their power and privilege for an individual or group, and build trust with the members of that group. Additionally, you have to understand yourself and examine and understand your privilege in relation to others \u2013 not apologize for it or feel bad because of it but use it to advance equity.
