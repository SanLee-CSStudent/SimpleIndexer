News News A- A+ NACC's New Statue makes a Great Tourist Attraction May 30, 2022 The new mascot statue is pictured in the quad on NACC's campus. The long-awaited statue of Northeast Alabama Community College (NACC) mascots, Trouper the Mustang and Roscoe the Campus Dog, is now a permanent fixture on NACC's campus! This beautiful art piece is a wonderful attraction for local community members and tourists to enjoy. The piece was created by artist Barbara Kilgore, Sculptor Katie Mae Adams, and Craig Wedderspoon of the University of Alabama Sculpture Department. The remarkable life-size sculpture includes exact details of the subjects, including Trouper the Mustang's brand markings and Roscoe's engraved collar tag. A narrative plaque by Big Fish author Daniel Wallace tells the story of Northeast, Trouper, and Roscoe. While you are on campus, check out Roscoe\u2019s rock grave, created by Mrs. Kilgore to honor not only Roscoe but area Native Americans. The grave is located along the college Walking Trail behind the main campus buildings. Police are on duty at Northeast to provide you with directions or help.
