Field of Interest One of the most important qualities to have in a job are people skills and the ability to interact and work with people of different backgrounds. By raising awareness of other ethnicities\u2019 experiences and cultures, we can begin to break down the walls of misconceptions and learn how to relate and communicate better with one another \u2014 thereby strengthening our bond to build stronger relationships with people of different cultures. Our Ethnic Studies program focuses on the interdisciplinary study of race and ethnicity and explores the unique experiences of Mexican Americans and African Americans. Our knowledgeable instructors will use critical thinking, inquiry, and discourse to explore the history and cultures, as well as socio-economic concerns, literature, gender and sexual identities, religions, and inter- \/ intra-group dynamics of these ethnicities. Successful completion of this program may open doors to employment opportunities with government agencies, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, community organizing, law firms, hospitals, business and economics, counseling, journalism, global development, and research organizations. Make it happen today \u2014 enroll in the Ethnic Studies program.
