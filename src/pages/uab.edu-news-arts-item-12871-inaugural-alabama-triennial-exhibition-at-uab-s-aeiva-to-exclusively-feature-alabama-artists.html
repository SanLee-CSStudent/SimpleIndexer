A new exhibition will exclusively showcase works by artists who were either born or are currently living in Alabama, at the University of Alabama at Birmingham from June 10-Aug. 12. The 2022 Alabama Triennial is curated by UAB\u2019s Abroms-Engel Institute for the Visual Arts. The triennial will fill all AEIVA\u2019s exhibition spaces. This exciting recurring exhibition will feature some of the best and brightest contemporary Alabama artists working today. An opening reception, free and open to the public, will be at 6 p.m. Friday, June 10, in AEIVA. The first iteration of the Alabama Triennial is curated by The Lydia Cheney and Jim Sokol Endowed Director of AEIVA John Fields and AEIVA Assistant Curator Tina Ruggieri. Future iterations will be curated by guest curators from around the region. Selections will include a wide range of artists of different ages, cultures, interests and artistic mediums. The show includes painting, photography, sculpture, textiles, neon, video, sound art, printmaking and more. Alabama has not always done a great job over the decades of acknowledging the talent in our own backyard, Fields says. \u201CThere are so many artists working in Alabama right now who are operating at a high level of sophistication \u2014 artists who have significant careers in places other than their home state,\u201D Fields said. \u201CI also see this exhibition as a community-building endeavor. So many of this first batch of artists are meeting each other for the very first time through this exhibition, even though they are working just a few miles down the road from each other.\u201D Artists featured in the 2022 Alabama Triennial at AEIVA include: Tony Bingham Jillian Marie Browning Annie Kammerer Butrus Tameca Cole Derek Cracco Lauren Frances Evans Steven Mark Finley Jr. Sydney A Foster Roscoe Hall Chintia Kirana Jonathan Lanier Jasper Lee Erin LeAnn Mitchell Lily Reeves Missy Roll Lily Ahree Siegel Each triennial will present a solo exhibition alongside the bigger exhibit to recognize and feature an Alabama artist of particular significance. For the inaugural event, a solo presentation of works by Mitchell, titled \u201CWhat you don\u2019t have in your head you\u2019ve got to have in your feet,\u201D will accompany the exhibition. Mitchell\u2019s exhibition will occupy AEIVA\u2019s Gallery One. \u201CWe hope this exhibition will surprise, provoke and challenge viewers by presenting ideas and viewpoints from such a diverse group,\u201D Ruggieri said. \u201CThe breadth of creativity and talent is abundant in the state of Alabama, and this is a small selection we feel highlights that talent. Many of the artists took this opportunity to create new works specifically for this show and take conceptual risks they might not have otherwise.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
