I think Dean Rutherford would be pleased with the diversity and quality of the applicants and recipients.\u201D Those receiving grants include (bios below): Ophelia Akoto (Clinton School of Public Service), Michael Anthony (UA-Fayetteville), Rebecca de la Fuente, (UACC-Batesville) and Brian Neel (UA-Little Rock). The endowment was established in 2021 at the University of Arkansas Foundation to honor Rutherford and provide support to student leaders across the UA System. This is the first year for grants to be awarded from the fund. Contributions to the fund are tax deductible and can be made online by selecting \u201CSkip Rutherford Student Leadership Endowment\u201D in the drop-down menu or mailing a check to the Clinton School at 1200 President Clinton Ave., Little Rock, AR 72201. \u201CWe are grateful to all of the donors to the endowment,\u201D Wilson said. \u201CThese four recipients were exactly the kind of people we envisioned helping when we had the idea to create this program. Dean Rutherford has helped students as a teacher and mentor throughout his life and career and we hope these mini grants are a fitting tribute to him.\u201D The grants were awarded by an independent committee appointed by Dr. Michael Moore, UA System vice president for academic affairs, in accordance with the terms of the endowment. Each spring, undergraduate and graduate students from any UA System campus will have the chance to apply for the grant.
