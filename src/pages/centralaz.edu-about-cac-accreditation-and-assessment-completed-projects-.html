These activities are tied directly to the nine Academic Quality Improvement Program criteria, and group faculty and staff to share a sense of activity, momentum, and purpose, while implementing district wide quality improvement. Action Project #1349 \u2013 Development and implementation of a comprehensive general education assessment plan. Assessment at the course and program level exists, however assessment of general education outcomes need to be developed. The goal is to align existing assessment efforts at the course and program level to the general education outcomes and develop a comprehensive plan. General Education Assessment 2014 Completed General Education Assessment 2012 Feedback General Education Assessment 2011 Feedback General Education Assessment 2010 Feedback 2009 Annual Update and Feedback 2008 Annual Update and Feedback The following Action Projects are a result of CAC\u2019s newly estastablished Quality Initiatives Proposal (QIP) process. This process was established to provide support for the development and implementation of initaitives that will improve CAC systems and processes. Action Project \u2013 Develop a College Culture Focused on Quality Results from two district-wide surveys, the Learning College Survey and the Quality Program Questionnaire revealed that the level of awareness and understanding of quality-related initiatives among employees was below expectation. There was a need to establish a comprehensive, broad-based quality improvement framework, which was consistent with the Systems Appraisal Feedback. This project will focus on promoting a culture of quality by embedding practices of quality improvement in CAC\u2019s existing annual operational planning process. Develop a College Culture Focused on Quality 2012 Completed Develop a College Culture Focused on Quality 2011 Feedback Develop a College Culture Focused on Quality 2010 Feedback The following Action Projects were in response to feedback received in the 1997 Quality Checkup Report and the April 2008 Reaffirmation of Accreditation Recommendation. Statewide initiatives and national emphasis on assessment prompted CAC to broaden its efforts in this area. Action Project #1348 \u2013 Review and revise the Central Arizona College (CAC) General Education Learning Outcomes. CAC developed and adopted a college policy in 1997 and in 1998 a set of general education learning outcomes were developed. Given the changing times and needs of CAC students and the community it serves, the college recognizes it is time to review and appropriately revise these outcomes to meet the needs for today and the future. General Education Outcomes 2010 Completed 2009 Annual Update and Feedback 2008 Annual Update and Feedback Action Project #1378 \u2013 Develop and implement a program review process that is clear and consistent, providing the institution with information to improve educational programs. Recent program reviews identified gaps and inconsistencies in the process. Therefore, it was determined the process should be reviewed and revised appropriately. Academic Program Review 2012 Completed Academic Program Review 2010 Feedback 2009 Annual Update and Feedback 2008 Annual Update and Feedback Action Project #1379 \u2013 Develop a set of institutional measures of effectiveness CAC completed its revision of the Vision, Mission, Values, and Strategic Goals. In order to appropriately measure the institution\u2019s progress toward its vision and goals, measures of effectiveness aligning to these guiding documents must be in place and assessed. Institutional Measures of Effectivenss 2012 Completed Institutional Measures of Effectiveness 2011 Feedback Institutional Measures of Effectiveness 2010 Feedback 2009 Annual Update and Feedback 2008 Annual Update and Feedback In 2001, CAC, like many institutions participating in the initial stages of AQIP, identified three Action Projects of places where to begin.

Action Project #183 \u2013 Construct and implement a dynamic institutional planning process Institutional Strategic Goals \u2013 The first in nearly 15 years, these goals set the foundation for the college\u2019s transformation to strategic operational planning and budgeting. 2001 Annual Update and Feedback 2004 Annual Update 2002 Annual Update and Feedback 2005 Annual Update 2003 Annual Update and Feedback Action Project #184 \u2013 Strengthen and enhance student assessment and advisement to promote learner success Improved Student Advisement Systems and Processes \u2013 The development of online advising tools and assessments prompted the discussion and initiatives around the development of outcomes and program review in the non-academic units of the college. 2001 Annual Update and Feedback 2004 Annual Update 2002 Annual Update 2005 Annual Update 2003 Annual Update and Feedback Action Project #185 \u2013 Improve data collection, data processing and information dissemination methods for learning support Revised Academic Hierarchy in Banner \u2013 The monumental accomplishment began with the continued effort to provide accurate and meaningful data to assist in effective and strategic decision making. 2001 Annual Update and Feedback 2004 Annual Update 2002 Annual Update and Feedback 2005 Annual Update 2003 Annual Update and Feedback Action Project #868 \u2013 Develop and implement a Non-Academic Review Process The Non-Academic Program Review process is a direct result of reviewing the Systems Appraisal and participation in an AQIP Strategy Forum.
