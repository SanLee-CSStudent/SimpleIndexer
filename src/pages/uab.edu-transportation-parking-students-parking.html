FAQ When do parking permits go on sale? Permits may be purchased online beginning at 8:00 a.m. on April 1st for the next Summer, June 1st for the Fall term and December 1st for the next Spring term. How do I add or change my vehicle and license plate information? Instructions: Visit the parking portal Login to the system with your Blazer ID and password Select the \u201CMore\u201D drop down menu from the top banner and select \u201CVehicles\u201D Follow the instructions for completing the process Can I get a refund for my permit? Permit refunds may only be issued after the hangtag is received in the UAB Transportation office. Any refunds are applied as of the day the permit is received. Permit refunds amounts follow the tuition policy refundable percentage and dates, which can be found on the UAB Academic Calendar. How does the new zone-based parking work? Zone-based parking introduces a system to reduce the time students have to spend searching for available spaces, while offering higher and lower cost parking options. Parking facilities are grouped by proximity to various areas of campus. To identify the best zone for your class schedule, a chart with estimated walking distances from the farthest space within each zone to major academic buildings may be found in the Estimated Walking Distances section above. Residential students (living in UAB Housing) may choose between one of the following two options: Zone A Zone H Commuter students (not living in UAB Housing) may choose between one of the following options: Zone B Zone C Zone D Zone E Zone F Zone G Students parking permits only allow the student to park in the zone designated within their respective permit. What happens if there are no available spaces in my zone? Zone-based parking is designed to ensure you will be able to find a space within your respective zone. Be sure to check all the parking areas within your zone. While space may not be available in the most convenient part of a zone, spaces are likely available in other portions of the zone. If you arrive to your zone and no space is available in any of the parking areas, park in Zone C and report it to the Transportation Office at (205) 934-3513 or This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. How can I save time looking for parking? Parking options closer to the academic core will fill up before those farther away. There are a number of actions students may take to reduce the time spent looking for a space: Know all parking areas within your zone Identify a preferred parking facility in your zone and a secondary area toward the perimeter of campus Know which Blazer Express routes service your preferred and secondary choices If you arrive at a lot\/deck and it is full, immediately proceed to your secondary location Keep a parking map in your vehicle Save the addresses of the parking areas in your zone to a smartphone mapping app Arrive on campus early \u2013 particularly early in the semester \u2013 allowing time to make it to class Download the DoubleMap app to see bus routes and real-time information for your bus Why did parking rates increase? UAB administration and Transportation leadership have listened to student feedback over several years, including insights captured by an external consulting firm that conducted a comprehensive parking and transportation study and provided recommendations to improve parking and transportation at UAB. Recommendations included: Additional parking facilities New parking technology Increasing safety (i.e., deck lighting, camera coverage) Enhancements to the Blazer Express bus system Improvements to customer experiences To respond to continued campus growth and student needs, additional parking \u2013 in conjunction with improving access to alternative transportation options \u2013 are a must. The permit rate increases are one step in this process. General information is available about the parking and transportation study and detailed information about student rates may be found on the uab.edu\/transportation website. What if I have to park farther away and must walk late at night? In addition to the Blazer Express bus system, Safety Escort is an on-demand van service available 24-hours per day. Between 9:00 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. request a ride using the TapRide app. Rides may also be requested 24-hours per day by calling 205-934-8772. Please note, calls between 5:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. are forwarded to UAB Police Dispatch for assistance.

Carpools reduce traffic congestion, which contributes to higher ground-level ozone ratings. Better ratings mean more industry and business for our city, as well as federal funds to complete road construction projects. To apply for a carpool, submit a rideshare application.
