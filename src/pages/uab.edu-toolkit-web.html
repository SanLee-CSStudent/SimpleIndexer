Website Request Form More Home Web Web UAB's web presence is its public face. It communicates our image and identity. It affects our ability to recruit and retain the best students, faculty, and staff, and it is critical to our ability to fulfill our mission. University Relations' Web Operations and Web Communications teams are charged with maintaining an online strategy and a clear set of best practices to simplify access, navigation, and search; promote high-quality web design; incorporate social networking; and provide security. Why? Because a cohesive web presence and a strong visual link with the UAB brand add strength to your message and reassure visitors. More importantly, they enable you to focus on delivering content that is timely, relevant, and interesting. As the responsible web administrator, you likely have questions that span various areas of expertise. We work closely with UAB Information Technology to provide resources and services central to maintaining the excellence that is consistent with the UAB brand. Understanding Our Web Team Structure We reference 'Web Communications' and 'Web Operations' often, but you may not know the difference. We'll explain below: Web Communications is the portion of our University Relations web team that builds and maintains our fee-for-service and centrally supported websites. We build custom template designs for UAB sites on Joomla. See the Support section on the Joomla page for more information. Web Operations is focused on the systems and processes that keep UAB's websites operating smoothly. Web Ops manages site creation on the Joomla and WordPress platforms and reports to site admins regarding site health and compliance.
