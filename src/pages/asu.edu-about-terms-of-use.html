ASU Computing and Communication Resources are managed by Users, ASU departments, or UTO, depending on a variety of business factors. UTO is not obligated to maintain backups of any file for any particular length of time. Users must protect and back up critical data. Individual Users and departments should develop policies and practices, coordinated with UTO as needed, to ensure regular backups of data and to implement steps to ensure that all critical data is compatible with all current generations of computing equipment, storage media, and media readers. Restriction of Access to Sensitive Data All ASU departments should ensure that access to sensitive data is restricted to those employees who have a need to access the information. Passwords that provide access to sensitive information should be changed on a regular basis. Right to Examine Computing and Communication Resources ASU Computing and Communication Resources may be examined to detect illegal content, to evaluate the security of the network, and to detect violations of Arizona Board of Regents and ASU policies. Networks, networked devices, and applications may be scanned for vulnerabilities as authorized by UTO. H. Violations and Enforcement Reporting Violations Any actual or suspected violation of these Terms of Use should be brought to the ASU system administrator of the equipment or facility most directly involved. In the case of a serious violation, Users are required to make a report to ASU\u2019s Information Security Office. ASU Response to a Reported Violation Upon receiving notice of a violation, ASU may temporarily suspend your privileges, move, or delete the allegedly offending material pending further proceedings. A User accused of a violation will be notified of the charge and have an opportunity to respond before ASU imposes a permanent sanction. Appropriate cases will be referred to the ASU disciplinary authority appropriate to the violator\u2019s status (e.g., Office of Student Life or employee\u2019s supervisor) or to appropriate law enforcement authorities. In addition to sanctions available under applicable law and ASU and ABOR policies, ASU may impose a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of access privileges to ASU Computing and Communication Resources, and other services or facilities. If ASU believes it necessary to preserve the integrity of Computing and Communication Resources or data, ASU may temporarily suspend any account, whether or not the account User is suspected of any violation. ASU will provide appropriate notice to the User. Servers and computers that threaten the security of ASU Computing and Communication Resources will be removed from the network and allowed to reconnect only with the approval of UTO.
