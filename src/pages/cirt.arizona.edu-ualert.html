UAlert is the most efficient and timely way to receive notifications about critical incidents affecting any of the University of Arizona campuses. By signing up for UAlert, you'll receive any all-campus notifications that are sent. If you are affiliated with the UA South campus or the College of Medicine-Phoenix campus, you can sign up to receive alerts specific to those campuses as well. Administered by members of the UA\u2019s Critical Incident Response Team (UACIRT), UAlert messages will be sent only during critical situations and the subscriber list will not be used to distribute any other type of content. (Visit the FAQs page for more information.) During a critical incident a series of messages will be sent to notify the community about the situations and provide important information and instructions. When the situation has been resolved, a final \u201Call clear\u201D message will be sent. UA students, employees and their friends and family are encouraged to check the UA website and local media reports for other critical updates.
