News Tuskegee University returns to campus for its 137th Spring Commencement Exercises May 10, 2022 Contact: Kawana McGough, Office of Communications, Public Relations and Marketing For the first time in almost three years, Tuskegee University hosted its 2022 Spring Commencement Exercises on campus from April 30-May 7. Since the pandemic, this year's graduation marked the first traditional commencement with students, parents, faculty, and staff present on campus. This spring, nearly 500 students received degrees from Tuskegee University, including 47 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) graduates and 51 Ph.D. and master\u2019s students from the graduate and professional schools. \"To the graduating Class of 2022, you made it. It fills my heart with great joy and admiration to see so many of our students participating in this graduation ceremony,\" said Dr. Charlotte Morris, Tuskegee University President. \"We take time out to recognize our graduating students' admiration, dedication, and fortitude. They held on, and now their trials become their testimony. They are proof positive that \u201Csuccess waits patiently for anyone who has the determination and strength to seize it,\u201D as quoted by Dr. Booker T. Washington. The week-long celebration started with the Graduate and Professional Schools Commencement ceremony on April 30, where alumnus Michele Wise Wright, Ph.D. '90 served as the guest speaker. In her remarks to the Class of 2022, Wright considered the theme of anatomy, using your brain and body to perform motions and tasks. \"Let these motions and tasks include not only reaching forward to lift up yourself but reaching back to lift up others. \"You will make an invaluable difference not only in your lives but for the lives of others and generations to come.\" Click here to view the Graduate and Professional School Commencement Ceremony. Immediately following the graduate and professional school ceremony, The Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine Oath Ceremony took place in the University Chapel. The speaker was Dr. Tiffini Brabham, Class of 1993 veterinary alumna. Dr. Brabham is also President of the Tuskegee Veterinary Alumni Association (TVMAA) and a Diplomate in the American Board of Toxicology (DABT). Dr. Brabham charged the graduates to live a \"3-Dimensional Life\" that strives at cultivating personal length, breadth, and height.\" Dr. Brabham also encouraged the veterinary graduates, letting them know that their TUCVM family is confident that they are prepared. They must continue to RISE UP to the occasion just like their veterinary student predecessors. To view the Veterinary Oath Ceremony from April 30, visit Tuskegee University's YouTube Channel: https:\/\/youtu.be\/IOzxKJHPE_g A Message to the Class of 2022 Dr. David Wilson, President of Morgan State University and Tuskegee University Alumnus, '77, '79, gave the University's newest undergraduates a thought-provoking Commencement address. Wilson has served as the President of Morgan State University since 2010; throughout his 30-year career in higher education administration, Wilson has a long record of accomplishments and unprecedented transformation at Morgan State University. In his remarks, Wilson urged students to use their magical power called the Tuskegee education \u2013 to transform themselves and to make the world and the nation in the vernacular what it should be. \"Take your magic, your Tuskegee education, and plan to lead your state and nation to be a better place,\" said Wilson. \"I challenge you not just to make a difference but be the difference and go where no other Tuskegeean has gone before.\" Wilson shared his story of why he chose Tuskegee University. \"Coming from Marengo County, Alabama, I was not supposed to be successful, and I was supposed to be a negative statistic. An insidious law in Alabama said Black children were not required to attend school, and my father did not send us to school without any degree of regularity.\" \"However, my dad put a rule in place that he would send me to school two days a week, but I would have to work three days, and he would reverse it the following week. I was in the seventh grade before I attended school consecutively for five days.\" \"When I started Tuskegee, my family had no money, but I worked several jobs to make ends meet. To make ends meet, I would paint the yellow lines on the University's campus \u2013 I even struggled academically, but I got it together and made it work,\" Wilson explained. \"The only place graduates where success comes before work is in the dictionary. So, you have to work hard for it. So clearly, my Tuskegee education has transformed my entire life; education was a liberating force, and my Tuskegee education literally freed me from a life of poverty and deprivation that I experienced growing up in Alabama.\" \"Indeed, my education from Mother Tuskegee has made me the man and leader I am today,\" concluded Wilson. Dr. Wilson was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University during the 2021 spring commencement ceremony held at Crampton Bowl in Montgomery. Pausing to Remember a Fallen Student President Charlotte P. Morris honored the late baseball athlete and student Douglas Brown, a senior from Montgomery, Alabama, during a somber moment at the commencement ceremony. During the Fall 2021 semester, Brown passed away and was just shy of completing his degree. Brown's parents, Douglas and Cheryl Brown were presented his degree posthumously. He was awarded a Bachelor's degree in Environmental, Natural Resources, and Plant Sciences. Commencement Milestones Other milestones this spring included the School Nursing and Allied Health, Capping & Pinning Ceremony, Tuskegee University Joint ROTC Commissioning Ceremony, and the Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine Oath Ceremony. The annual Capping, Pinning, and White Coat ceremony was held on May 6. The keynote speaker was alumnus Dr. Keinee G. Austin '91, Therapy Manager at Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital of Montgomery. Themed \"Developing Healthcare Servant Leader Scholars that Provide Competent, Compassionate Care: The TU Way,\" Austin gave a message to the graduates surrounding her motto to \"empower and inspire others to lead successfully.\" \"You have made it, you have persevered, and you all are sitting here, and its evidence that hard work pays off,\" said Austin. \"Taking care of people and being compassionate are very important; you are the ones that teach their lives daily and provide comfort to clients. As a care provider, always remember to make sure you are providing encouragement, support, and understanding. Click here to view the Capping, Pinning, and White Coat ceremony. During Tuskegee University's Joint ROTC Commissioning Ceremony on May 6, six graduates from the Class of 2022 received their military commissions \u2014 one from the Air Force ROTC and five from the Army ROTC. Alumnus and United States Army Colonel Dawson A. Plummer '94, Chief of the Soldier, Maneuver, Robotics, and AI Synthetic Training Environment Division, gave the commissioning address. All Army and Air Force ROTC cadets were commissioned as second lieutenants and will move on to their first tours to lead troops and airmen worldwide. \"Your reputation as an officer starts today, noted Col. Plummer. \"Establishing a positive reputation will open doors and allow you to have several opportunities to be noticed by senior leaders. Make sure you take advantage of every opportunity to be mentored by senior leaders.\" Click here to view the commissioning ceremony. Other ceremonies included the School of Education's Teacher Induction, where eight new teachers were inducted for the 2022 academic year, and the Order of Engineer ceremony.
