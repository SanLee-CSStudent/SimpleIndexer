Photo courtesy of Kacey KeithKacey Keith often encounters conflict when addressing structural and cultural harm through her work as a consultant with Honeycomb Justice Consulting. Given her personal, academic, and professional experiences growing up in the South, she has an appreciation for people who are willing and prepared to face disputes head-on. \u201CI don\u2019t think I would understand [how] to approach conflict in a straight-forward way if it wasn\u2019t for being from Alabama,\u201D said Keith. \u201CConflict lives in unison with peace\u2014so, how do we handle conflict with peaceful solutions?\u201D During her early years in Birmingham, Keith developed a deep connection to the city\u2019s civil and human rights history. At the same time, she wanted to learn more about cultures outside of her hometown. This interest prompted her to consider colleges that offered dynamic international studies programs, eventually leading her to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. She enrolled at UAB in 2012 and sought out an array of classes to complement her international studies major. That curiosity steered her to a peace studies course which exposed her to peace on a global scale. The experience inspired her to continue seeking out peace studies courses at UAB, and, eventually, she enrolled in a class with Douglas Fry, Ph.D., former chair of the Department of Anthropology. Fry\u2019s teaching had a profound impact on Keith, influencing her future academic and career pathways. \u201CI was hooked,\u201D said Keith. \u201CIt was very much in alignment with my world view\u2026 So, I applied to the Anthropology of Peace and Human Rights graduate program [at UAB].\u201D The Anthropology of Peace and Human Rights (APHR) program is a two-year master\u2019s program focusing on peace as behavioral process at multiple levels including at the level of individuals, families, groups, communities, cultures, and nations. Soon after starting the program, Keith met another influential faculty member in the Department of Anthropology: Peter Verbeek, Ph.D. Keith took several of Verbeek\u2019s classes, and, throughout those experiences, she learned that peace ethology is a measurable science with actionable steps. \u201CI loved the courses,\u201D said Keith. \u201CThey were very influential\u2014specifically in understanding what it takes to make a culture shift for the understanding of peace.\u201D Verbeek\u2019s mentorship and scholarly work proved to be valuable to Keith as she concluded her graduate studies and transitioned into her career. Soon after completing the APHR program, Keith started working for the City of Birmingham and was immediately given an opportunity to apply her knowledge of peace and human rights. \u201CI was an intern with [Mayor Randall Woodfin\u2019s] social justice transition team,\u201D said Keith. \u201CI helped develop the Office of Peace and Policy and supported the creation of a peace plan for the City of Birmingham.\u201D During her time with the city, Keith formed an enduring bond with a co-worker, Jasmyn Story. Together, Keith and Story began working on nonviolence, restorative justice, and reentry-focused programs for Birmingham. Keith connected with the strategic planning side of the work, while Story served as an effective practitioner. For Keith, it was powerful to further apply the knowledge and skills she attained through the APHR program. \u201CI\u2019m interested in the neurobiology of empathy,\u201D said Keith. \u201CUnderstanding that empathy is one of the most powerful tools for peace is what led me to restorative justice.\u201D Keith\u2019s interest in restorative justice continued to grow, as did her collaborative relationship with Story. Eventually, they both transitioned into roles with Honeycomb Justice Consulting, a collective of consultants that helps institutions and companies implement restorative justice practices and navigate instances of harm. Honeycomb also supports its clients with strategic planning and training. Keith\u2014who now lives in Denver, Colorado\u2014serves as a core team member for the consultancy and continues to work alongside Story, her long-time collaborator and mentor. As she helps expand the impact of Honeycomb across the country, she looks back on her time at UAB and Birmingham fondly. \u201CI\u2019m grateful for UAB, and I\u2019m grateful for [its] international focus,\u201D said Keith. \u201CThe wisdom that came from the professors plus the legacy of the city, together, really created the space for the learning that I needed to be able to root myself in this work.\u201D Verbeek celebrates Keith\u2019s accomplishments and believes her work will have a lasting impact. \"During her time in the APHR program, Kacey was both a scholar and practitioner of peace. Her work and insights have benefited APHR as well as our Birmingham community,\u201D said Verbeek. \u201CWe will follow Kacey\u2019s career on peace with great interest in the knowledge that she will excel at it.\u201D back to top Kacey Keith pursuing justice and peace in her career Kacey Keith often encounters conflict when addressing structural and cultural harm through her work as a consultant, and she has an appreciation for people who are willing and prepared to face disputes head-on.

Trey Gordon, co-founder of Adjacent SpaceTrey Gordon is passionate about his community and aims to do everything in his power to serve the people within it. So much so, he co-founded Adjacent Space, a nonprofit that is committed to advancing public spaces into more visual-tactile accessible and equitable places for Deaf, hard-of-hearing, and Deafblind communities. Now, Gordon\u2014an Alabama native who self-identifies as fully Deaf\u2014is receiving public recognition for his impactful work with Adjacent Space. In February, the Birmingham Business Journal honored him as a 2022 Leader in Diversity, an achievement that further elevates his work and leadership. Gordon is an alumnus of the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Master of Public Administration program, and he views the skills and knowledge he developed in the program as vital to his growth as a nonprofit leader. \u201CMy professors loved and cultivated the idea of Adjacent Space, and the support was incredible and propelled me and my team to go for it,\u201D said Gordon. \u201CTheir understanding and advice created a path I could walk through.\u201D Gordon discovered the MPA program while living in New Delhi, India. \u201CI was\u2026 working for a Deaf-led nonprofit organization focusing on empowering Deaf Indians in learning basic English and job skills, connecting with Deaf leaders, and teaching Deaf culture,\u201D he said. That passion prompted him to research MPA programs with course offerings on nonprofit management, which led him to UAB\u2019s Department of Political Science and Public Administration. \u201CI saw that UAB had a great fit for my interest,\u201D said Gordon. \u201CAnd UAB is such a lovely university located in a vibrant, growing city in Birmingham.\u201D Gordon excelled in the program, and he remains proud of his experience at UAB. \u201CI feel like I'm an ambassador for UAB when working with people, and a lot of lessons I learned in classes really came through during my work around the community, so I'm a grateful Blazer,\u201D said Gordon. Gordon often sought advice from his faculty mentors while at UAB, so, now, he finds opportunities to share his wisdom with students who are currently preparing for the future. In Gordon\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s important to be present and focus on the moment at hand. \u201C[I]t\u2019s really important for me to not think too much about what I should be doing,\u201D said Gordon. \u201CJust be\u2014you\u2019re more than enough\u2026things will come.\u201D Read more... I am Arts and Sciences: Charles Scribner Charles Scribner exemplifies school pride when he reflects on his time at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Charles Scribner addresses the crowd at a Black Warrior Riverkeeper event.Charles Scribner exemplifies school pride when he reflects on his time at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201CUAB is very important to me and my family,\u201D said Scribner. \u201CI\u2019m proud that UAB is such an engine for the state [of Alabama].\u201D Scribner, born and raised in New York City, credits his wife and his career for bringing him to Birmingham. While earning his Bachelor of Arts in History and a Certificate in Environmental Studies at Princeton University, Scribner met his future wife Elizabeth Yates\u2014a native of Birmingham and UAB Mathematics Ph.D. now named Dr. Elizabeth Scribner\u2014who envisioned returning home after Princeton. As their relationship flourished, Scribner was also developing a passion for the international Waterkeeper movement and authoring a 100-page senior thesis about the history and effectiveness of Waterkeeper Alliance. Through his research, he met the team at the Black Warrior Riverkeeper, a Birmingham-based nonprofit that is \u201Cdedicated to promoting clean water for the sake of public health, recreation, and wildlife habitat throughout [its] patrol area, the Black Warrior River watershed.\u201D \u201CI interviewed the staff, and, in the process, they offered me the job of director of development,\u201D said Scribner. So, after graduating in 2005, Scribner\u2014and Elizabeth\u2014moved to Birmingham, and he began his journey with the Black Warrior Riverkeeper. According to Scribner, it is especially exciting and important to support the waterkeeper effort in Alabama. \u201CWe\u2019re number one in freshwater biodiversity,\u201D said Scribner. \u201CAnd, beyond that, we have a very\u2026 outdoorsy population that loves to cool off in our rivers and lakes and go fishing\u2014it\u2019s a great American tradition, particularly a great Alabama tradition.\u201D After working in his role as director of development for a few years, Black Warrior Riverkeeper\u2019s Board of Directors promoted Scribner to executive director. Scribner was determined to build new skills and knowledge so he could further support the mission of the organization. He researched programs that focused on nonprofit leadership and management and found a graduate certificate program available through UAB\u2019s Department of Political Science and Public Administration. When he reviewed the course offerings, he discovered that every course was applicable to his work at the Black Warrior Riverkeeper. \u201CI realized a background in environmental studies and a great passion for protecting the environment are not the same as being trained to run an organization,\u201D said Scribner. \u201CI knew what I wanted to do, and I wanted to do it better.\u201D Scribner enrolled in UAB\u2019s Graduate Certificate in Nonprofit Management program in 2010, and, soon after completing it, he decided to pursue his Master of Public Administration. During Scribner\u2019s time in graduate school, he uncovered opportunities to apply his new knowledge at Black Warrior Riverkeeper. As the organization celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, Scribner acknowledges the numerous legal and advocacy victories his team has achieved along the way. That said, he is particularly energized about an emerging volunteer cleanup program. The program is prompting meaningful, hands-on participation from the public, and, to top it off, the outreach coordinator who is facilitating the effort, Katie Fagan, is an alumna of UAB\u2019s Department of Anthropology. This enduring UAB connection\u2014and many others\u2014is particularly important to Scribner (Learn more about Fagan and her journey at UAB). \u201CThe networking that takes place [at UAB] creates incredible connections that have been as valuable to my career as the classes I took in the MPA program,\u201D said Scribner. Although he finished his graduate degree in 2015, Scribner still finds plenty of opportunities to stay connected to UAB and the MPA program. In 2017, he won the College\u2019s Alumni Service Award, and, in 2018, he became president of the UAB National Alumni Society\u2019s MPA Chapter. \u201CI really enjoyed the process of working with other board members to turn the alumni society into something really organized and impactful,\u201D said Scribner. \u201CThat\u2019s easy to do when you\u2019re working with other MPAs.\u201D As he looks to the future, it\u2019s clear that he will continue to find ways to collaborate with his fellow UAB alumni and give back to the MPA program. Also, if you attend a UAB football game at Protective Stadium, you\u2019re likely to see Scribner with his wife and four children cheering on his beloved Blazers. Read more... Johnny Bates honors his father with an endowed scholarship in mathematics When Johnny Edward \u201CRusty\u201D Bates, M.D., was growing up in Sipsey, Alabama, he viewed his father, a draftsman and engineer, as one of the smartest people he knew. When Johnny Edward \u201CRusty\u201D Bates, M.D., was growing up in Sipsey, Alabama, he viewed his father, a draftsman and engineer, as one of the smartest people he knew. \u201CMy father was an inspiration,\u201D said Bates. Although his father, Henry E. Bates Jr., was both skillful and knowledgeable, he was limited in his ability to advance in his career due to his academic credentials. According to Bates, \u201CHe always felt that not having his degree impeded his ability to move up the ranks.\u201D Johnny Edward \u201CRusty\u201D Bates, M.D.For Bates, this observation about his father serves as an enduring source of inspiration, both in his academic journey and his professional career. While in middle and high school, Bates excelled in mathematics and learned from nurturing teachers who helped him establish a strong foundation in the discipline. As he looked to his future, he decided to pursue a degree in mathematics, while also working full-time. He briefly attended Birmingham-Southern College, then enrolled at Walker College to earn his associate degree. He envisioned attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham after Walker College, but he faced a financial barrier. \u201CI didn\u2019t come from a wealthy family,\u201D said Bates. Thankfully, he received a generous scholarship, which helped him scale the barrier. That scholarship, which came from a wealthy businessman, set him on a new academic trajectory. He enrolled at UAB and earned a B.S. in Mathematics and a minor in art history. During his time as an undergraduate at UAB, he saw and appreciated the level of care and excellence his professors brought to the classroom each day. \u201CI had a great experience with great educators,\u201D said Bates. \u201CThey loved teaching. [My professors] took an interest in me as a student. They wrote letters for me when I applied to medical school.\u201D After completing his undergraduate degree, Bates was accepted into the Heersink School of Medicine. He earned an M.D. in 1982, then completed his residency at University of Texas in Galveston. Through his studies and training, Bates became deeply interested taking care of populations of patients, rather than focusing on individual patients. He decided he wanted to become a leader in correctional care, so he started his own company, Quality Correctional Healthcare (QCHC). While Bates studied mathematics and medicine at UAB, he enjoyed solving problems and making decisions that would improve outcomes. Nowadays, he applies those same skills at QCHC. \u201CI\u2019m going to use those techniques to improve our overall services. We\u2019re going to need to find smarter and better ways of doing things,\u201D said Bates. He has continued his academic journey to support these goals too. He earned a Master of Medical Management for Physicians from Carnegie Mellon University, and, recently, he started taking courses in artificial intelligence and machine learning from the University of Texas at Austin and the Massachusetts Institute for Technology. Bates still looks back on the scholarship that helped him establish his academic foundation at UAB with gratitude, while also considering the obstacles his father faced. Moving forward, he wants to support future students as they pursue degrees in mathematics and honor his father at the same time. Given these priorities, Bates recently established the Henry E. Bates Jr. Endowed Scholarship in Mathematics, which will benefit undergraduate mathematics students who demonstrate strong academic promise. \u201CI think everybody who desires an education should be able to get an education,\u201D said Bates. \u201CI want to be able to benefit someone who has that desire but may not have the resources to get the degree.\u201D Clearly, Bates\u2019s generosity and admiration for his father are reflected in this endowed scholarship in the Department of Mathematics.

For Rosie O\u2019Beirne, her background in anthropology informs her work as University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s chief digital strategy and marketing officer every day\u2014a somewhat surprising (and valuable) connection. Pursuing what you love doing can lead you in unlikely directions in your career. For Rosie O\u2019Beirne, her background in anthropology informs her work as University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s chief digital strategy and marketing officer every day\u2014a somewhat surprising (and valuable) connection. Rosie O\u2019BeirneO\u2019Beirne always knew she would go to college. According to O\u2019Beirne, coming from a multicultural household\u2014her parents are from Japan and Southern America\u2014higher education was not a question. \u201CCulturally, education is\u2026 so important in Japanese culture, so all my life I knew I was going to go to college,\u201D said O\u2019Beirne. She describes UAB as a place where \u201Cyou could work and hold a job. Scrappy people came to UAB.\u201D She wanted to be a part of this environment of like-minded individuals and get her foot in the door\u2014that said, she had no idea what she was going to study. When O\u2019Beirne was sitting in one of her first college classrooms listening to Dr. Bruce Wheatley\u2014a professor in the Department of Anthropology at the time\u2014discuss his discipline, everything clicked. \u201CEverything this professor is talking about relates to my upbringing, to growing up in a multicultural household,\u201D said O\u2019Beirne. \u201CEverything, suddenly, about me growing up in this home, made sense sitting in the Intro to Cultural Anthropology class.\u201D That moment inspired O\u2019Beirne to declare anthropology as her major, and she went on to earn both her B.A. and M.A. (through a joint program with UAB and the University of Alabama) in the discipline. She still uses the skills she honed and developed in the College of Arts and Sciences\u2014including a keen understanding of cultural relativism\u2014in her current role. \u201CI am an anthropologist by training and a marketer by trade,\u201D says O\u2019Beirne. \u201CIn my job as a marketer, I use the anthropology toolkit every day\u2026 seeing the world through other people\u2019s eyes or walking the world in someone else\u2019s shoes. [U]nderstanding the diversity of [UAB\u2019s] student body and the diversity of needs is critical.\u201D After receiving her M.A., O\u2019Beirne worked as the co-director of the Media Studies Program at UAB, alongside colleague Michele Forman. The duo created the Media Lab, which gave students access to professional-grade technology to create media. Through the lab, O\u2019Beirne also created the innovative Digital Media Fellows program. The program acted as a creative agency staffed by 12 UAB students who created original digital storytelling content for clients ranging from UAB academic departments to nonprofits in the Birmingham community. Media Fellows gave students work experience before graduating, which allowed most of the students to be hired soon after their graduation. \u201CThis program acted almost as an apprenticeship where we were able to pay students and give them work. These students were getting hired right out of the gate\u2026 there were employers that wanted them,\u201D said O\u2019Beirne. After directing the Digital Media Fellows Program for three years, O\u2019Beirne received an unexpected invitation to join UAB's central marketing team, which eventually led to the role of chief digital strategy and marketing officer. \u201CLong-story short, I\u2019m running marketing for the university. Many of the thoughts and skills I learned as an anthropology student are translatable to the marketing industry. It is also why I enjoy promoting the value of a liberal arts education. A good college education prepares you to think\u2014no matter the industry. And that\u2019s what I received at UAB,\u201D said O\u2019Beirne. She views her career path as atypical, and, as a result, she encourages students to explore their options during their college career. \u201CWhat do you love doing? [I]f you can figure out how to tap into things you love doing and translate that over into a career, then you win. The best is when you like what you\u2019re doing,\u201D said O\u2019Beirne.

MPA graduates participate in prestigious Presidential Management Fellows Program The U.S. Office of Personnel Management facilitates a valuable leadership development experience known as the Presidential Management Fellows Program (PMF). The U.S. Office of Personnel Management facilitates a valuable leadership development experience known as the Presidential Management Fellows Program (PMF). Through the prestigious and competitive PMF program, graduate students who aim to pursue careers in government participate in a two-year appointment with a government agency. During the appointment, participants receive leadership training, full salary and benefits, and active mentorship. The University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of Political Science and Public Administration (PSPA) has an impressive record with the PMF program. As of January 2022, eight of the department\u2019s MPA alumni have served (or will serve) as PMFs: Mason Beale Rachel Hicks Shabani Tiffany Brown Misha Manzy Elizabeth Hendrix Amy O\u2019Dell Kaia Greene Ollie Davison In December 2021, Davison received a notification from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management letting him know that he was selected for the program. It proved to be a life-changing moment. \u201CAs a boy from Prichard, Alabama, I never would have imagined my journey would include becoming a Presidential Management Fellow,\u201D said Davison. \u201CI am so grateful to represent UAB and the MPA program during this prestigious fellowship. I cannot wait to show Washington D.C. what a boy from Prichard, Alabama can do to make a tangible difference for all Americans.\" According to Rob Blanton, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration, the PMF program is a substantial achievement worthy of celebration. \u201CThe Presidential Management Fellowship provides an invaluable experience to students in that it includes employment at a federal agency as well as multiple opportunities for future professional development and growth. It is a very prestigious and competitive program, the number of applicants is generally over 10,000 and only five percent are accepted,\u201D said Blanton. \u201CWe are very proud to have such a high number of Presidential Management Fellows, as it attests to the ability of our students, as well as to the quality of the educational experience and mentoring that our students receive.\u201D You can learn more about the department\u2019s MPA program by visiting the Master of Public Administration webpage.

Baker, Principal Owner and Managing Director of Baker Camp Arnold Capital Management, you cannot overlook his passion for history. In fact, most of the artifacts and framed items on his office walls are testaments to his deep interest in the discipline. When speaking with Joshua L. Baker, Principal Owner and Managing Director of Baker Camp Arnold Capital Management, you cannot overlook his passion for history. In fact, most of the artifacts and framed items on his office walls are testaments to his deep interest in the discipline. \u201CI think history is well-rounded,\u201D said Baker. \u201CIt gives us a different lens to look through.\u201D The term \u201Cwell-rounded\u201D also applies nicely to Baker\u2014a historian, former international soccer player, collegiate baseball player, and successful entrepreneur. Baker grew up in Cropwell, Alabama. As a young and talented multi-sport athlete, he sought opportunities to further develop his skills on the field, eventually leading him to Coosa Valley Academy his junior year of high school to play baseball, then to Bullock Memorial School his senior year after a family move to south Alabama. After graduation, he earned a slot as a designated hitter on the Huntingdon College baseball team. At Huntingdon, Baker studied history and met his future wife, Audrey. After getting engaged, they decided to relocate to Birmingham so she could pursue a career in the medical field. Determined to continue his academic journey, Baker looked to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201CUAB covers the whole gamut\u2026 I had a different professor for every single discipline,\u201D said Baker. \u201CIt allowed for a more creative focus on the subject matter.\u201D While at UAB, Baker decided to major in history with a minor in anthropology and archaeology. Also, he participated in the United States Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) program. Between his studies and ROTC, Baker\u2019s vision for his future began to materialize. \u201CI knew I was good with numbers... I realized quickly that I didn\u2019t want to work for anyone [though],\u201D said Baker. By studying history, Baker believes he further developed his analytical mindset, which, in his opinion, complements his inherent talent with numbers. Through this intersection, Baker uncovered a key differentiator for his future business in financial services and capital management\u2014specifically, to analyze every client\u2019s unique situation and \u201Cconnect every piece of the puzzle\u201D in a consultative manner. The road to owning his own business was long, though. After graduating from UAB, Baker worked for several banks, then explored a career with a captive broker-dealer. Those experiences proved to be challenging (and occasionally disappointing), but his passion for financial services and capital management while helping people achieve their goals remained firm. Eventually, he knew he needed to build his own business to fully realize his vision. \u201CWe started with zero,\u201D said Baker. \u201CI cast a vision and figured it out.\u201D Baker took the leap in May of 2017\u2014\u201Cafter incessantly looking at the pros and cons and praying over the decision for over two years prior to that,\u201D he says\u2014and launched Baker Camp Arnold Capital Management, a full-service financial advisory firm located in Hoover, Alabama. In less than five years, the company has grown substantially and received numerous acknowledgements and awards, including: \u201CBest Of\u201D accolades from both the cities of Hoover and Vestavia Hills Inclusion in B-Metro magazine\u2019s \u201CFaces of Birmingham 2020: The Face of Financial Planning\u201D Published interview with Advisors magazine Marquis Who\u2019s Who Top Business Owners and Entrepreneurs UAB National Alumni Society Excellence in Business Top 25 in both 2019 and 2020 Along with growing his business and team, Baker and his wife Audrey also find many ways to give back to the community\u2014including a newly-established endowed scholarship for the UAB Department of History. \u201CWe wanted to focus on something very specific,\u201D said Baker. \u201CWe\u2019re the first to establish an endowed scholarship for graduate students [in the Department of History]. The Joshua L. and Audrey D. Baker Endowed Scholarship will help future graduate students in history overcome financial barriers, so they can focus on their studies. Baker\u2019s appreciation for graduate studies is a personal commitment too\u2014one day, he hopes to earn his master\u2019s degree in the discipline of military history. In the meantime, between reading several World War II books a month and traveling the country to watch his kids play hockey and hunting whatever is in season, Baker is finding plenty of opportunities to stay busy outside of the office.

I am Arts and Sciences: Lisa Higginbotham Many Blazers donate to and engage with the Benevolent Fund, a charitable giving campaign that supports health and human service agencies, selected health-related charities, and University of Alabama at Birmingham employees through the Employee Emergency Assistance Program. Lisa HigginbothamMany Blazers donate to and engage with the Benevolent Fund, a charitable giving campaign that supports health and human service agencies, selected health-related charities, and University of Alabama at Birmingham employees through the Employee Emergency Assistance Program. Through the Benevolent Fund, UAB has distributed over $43 million to local nonprofit organizations and to UAB employees. The work changes lives, and it is a model of charitable excellence. One of the key people behind the Benevolent Fund is Lisa Higginbotham, a two-time graduate of UAB\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences. Higginbotham earned both her Bachelor of Social Work and Master of Public Administration in the early 1990s, and, afterwards, she navigated a prolific career in nonprofit management across Alabama. \u201CI fondly reflect on my time in CAS,\u201D said Higginbotham. \u201CFrom the friends I made who are now colleagues to working alongside Dr. Norm Eggleston researching discrimination in the workplace against people living with HIV or exploring ethical decision making with Dr. Mary Guy, it was all instrumental in me becoming the person I am today.\u201D During her time in the nonprofit sector, Higginbotham worked for Childcare Resources; Girls, Inc.; and the Children\u2019s Trust Fund. Often, she improved processes and structures to ensure the organizations and institutions could do their best work and maximize impact\u2014a skillset she gleaned from her time in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration. When it came time to expand her family, Higginbotham decided to seek a part-time position, so she could achieve her desired work-life balance. Thankfully, at that time, UAB needed a new team member to support the Employee Emergency Assistance program\u2014a perfect fit for Higginbotham. Higginbotham accepted the role, and, eventually, she became the fund manager for the Benevolent Fund. She deployed a systems leadership approach to her work and uncovered opportunities to do more than provide funding to local nonprofits. For example, under Higginbotham\u2019s leadership, the Benevolent Fund expanded service-learning opportunities for UAB students, developed new systems for Employee Emergency Assistance, and launched Blazer Kitchen (UAB\u2019s campus food pantry which has provided 400,000 meals in just over four years). \u201CI launched Blazer Kitchen with a lot of help and support from our council and the UAB administration,\u201D said Higginbotham. \u201CWe knew there were employees who needed help through our Employee Emergency Assistance program\u2026 and they could [also] benefit from access to healthy food.\u201D Every step of the way, Higginbotham has leveraged data, best practices, and her past experiences and knowledge to ensure her work is people-focused and impact-driven. Over the past two years, the pandemic created numerous challenges for the Benevolent Fund, including limitations on grant-making and a pause on house builds with Habitat for Humanity, a long-standing nonprofit partner. That said, Higginbotham still encounters individual stories that illustrate the impact of her work\u2014even during the pandemic. Recently, she worked closely with a UAB employee who experienced trauma and loss due to COVID-19. By highlighting UAB\u2019s sick leave bank and counseling services offered by local nonprofits, Higginbotham was able to support the employee and help them navigate a heart wrenching moment. As Higginbotham reflects on her experiences during her 18 years at UAB, she notes her passion for connecting employees to resources in the community. \u201CWhen I listen to nonprofits talk about the programs they have in the community, I think, \u2018How can this help our UAB employees,\u2019\u201D said Higginbotham. Now that she is back on campus (and in a new building), she sees endless opportunities to continue pursuing that passion and to deepen partnerships with nonprofit organizations. She also aims to expand Blazer Kitchen\u2019s operating hours and further engage with the Department of Social Work and its students. Moving forward, the horizon is bright as the Benevolent Fund steers through the pandemic and continues its life-changing work. \u201CI encourage everyone\u2014students, alumni, and employees\u2014to reflect on where you are today, thank those who have helped you achieve your success, offer mentorship to the next generation of leaders, engage with your community to contribute to the public good, and stay connected to UAB,\u201D said Higginbotham.

I am Arts and Sciences: Kristine Farag Being the first to do something can be challenging\u2014thankfully, when you have a mentor by your side, the experience can be enjoyable and empowering. Kristine FaragBeing the first to do something can be challenging\u2014thankfully, when you have a mentor by your side, the experience can be enjoyable and empowering. For Kristine Farag, one of the first students to graduate from the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Undergraduate Immunology Program, she sought and found mentorship from Heather Bruns, Ph.D., the co-director of the innovative new program. \u201CWe were the first class to graduate [in Spring 2021]. We were a really small class, so it was nice to have good relationships with our mentors,\u201D said Farag. \u201CI found a lot of mentors, including Dr. Bruns. We have a unique relationship.\u201D \u201CKristine is an engaging, kind, and compassionate individual,\u201D said Bruns. Farag came to UAB from Carmel, Indiana, with a strong science background. While studying anatomy and working in a research lab in high school, she learned about immunology\u2014the study of the structure and function of the immune system\u2014for the first time. The field intrigued her, so, when it was time to declare a major, she decided to join the first cohort of the Undergraduate Immunology Program, an interdisciplinary partnership between the College of Arts and Sciences and the Heersink School of Medicine. The program\u2014which launched in 2017\u2014offers the only undergraduate major in immunology in the U.S. with coursework that focuses on topics including the innate immune system and microbial pathogen-immune system interactions. Through the program, students conduct hands-on research and prepare for careers in medicine, biomedical research, health-related professions, and\/or science-related professions. \u201CThe newness was really interesting. It feels like the up-and-coming thing,\u201D said Farag. \u201CI would learn something new every day. [The faculty] would always bring in different clinical correlations.\u201D Those correlations were valuable to Farag because she came to UAB with a conditional acceptance to the Heersink School of Medicine through the Early Medical School Acceptance Program. Now, Farag, in Indianapolis, is pursuing her M.D. at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Bruns is proud to see Farag applying her knowledge in medical school. \u201CKristine is a highly accomplished individual in both academics and research,\u201D said Bruns. \u201CShe exemplifies the attributes we desire all of graduates from the Undergraduate Immunology Program, and we are so proud that she is an alumna of our major.\u201D While at UAB, Farag also contributed her time and talent to the UAB Dance Marathon, a fundraiser that benefits Children\u2019s of Alabama. Farag is passionate about the student-led program\u2014which is also a part of the Children\u2019s Miracle Network\u2014and found an opportunity to include Bruns. \u201CI asked her to be our faculty sponsor for Dance Marathon because we needed someone from the school to be a part of it,\u201D said Farag. Throughout this experience, Farag and Bruns continued to collaborate and work together. By her third year with the Dance Marathon, Farag became the president and, in turn, nurtured valuable leadership skills. \u201CI have seen first-hand her passion and compassion for others and her ability to be a strong leader to accomplish goals that benefit others,\u201D said Bruns. Now, in medical school, Farag reflects fondly on her time at UAB and offers appreciation for the strong foundation she built during her time in the burgeoning immunology program. She also acknowledges that the program\u2019s curriculum was particularly important during a global pandemic. \u201CWith COVID-19, it\u2019s a very interesting time to have this knowledge,\u201D said Farag. \u201CMy past year-and-a-half of being an undergrad was absorbed by COVID-19\u2014that made those classes more interesting.\u201D When asked to offer a piece of advice to her peers who will graduate in December, she pauses for a moment and smiles. \u201CTreasure the next few months\u2014it\u2019s a really special time,\u201D said Farag.

Taylor ByasThrough language, poets help us better understand and navigate life. However, the journey to a career in poetry is not always clear (or easy). For Taylor Byas, a renowned poet who is pursuing her Ph.D. in Creative Writing at the University of Cincinnati, her dream of becoming a writer emerged when she was a child. \u201CI\u2019ve been a bookworm since I can remember,\u201D said Byas. \u201CI think I always knew that I wanted to pursue English and to pursue something that has to do with language.\u201D Although English was her first passion, she found herself on the pre-medicine track when she arrived at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2013. She chose this path because her mother was a successful doctor, and because several people questioned her future career prospects if she focused on English solely. \u201CAlong the way, I let people discourage me\u2026 I let them ask \u2018What are you going to do with an English degree?\u2019\u201D said Byas. She stuck with pre-med for a year, but, deep down, she felt out-of-sync with the coursework. Eventually, after receiving support and encouragement from her emerging network of friends and mentors, she pivoted back into the English program. \u201CI stepped into the confidence to be fully myself,\u201D said Byas. \u201CUAB created a culture of perseverance. It also instilled a mindset in me\u2014of not being afraid to fail and believing in my ideas.\u201D As her confidence grew, so did her talent. While pursuing her B.A. in the Department of English, Byas\u2019 creative voice shined, and, before she knew it, she was considering the department\u2019s graduate program. Immediately after earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017, she matriculated into the M.A. program with a focus on creative writing. \u201CMy master\u2019s degree, specifically, is where I found my voice in writing,\u201D said Byas. \u201CIt was the support of that wonderful department\u2026 I was loved and believed in\u2014well before I found it for myself. That support system was so crucial.\u201D Along with finding her voice, Byas also benefited from the overall rigor of the program. \u201CI think we never really know\u2026how rigorous something is until we step out of it and apply those things,\u201D said Byas. \u201CWhen I arrived at my Ph.D. program, I found myself not struggling. I really have had a fairly smooth time in my doctorate degree.\u201D Her smooth transition into her doctoral program also allowed her the space and time to launch a fruitful career as a poet and writer. Over the past year, she secured a literary agent, released her first chapbook of poetry, sold her first full-length book manuscript to Soft Skull Press, and won the Adrienne Rich Poetry Prize\u2014a series of significant milestones for a young poet. \u201CThis last year has been incredibly busy and also life-changing in ways that I couldn\u2019t have anticipated,\u201D said Byas. Byas maintains a down-to-earth and welcoming demeanor amidst her noteworthy achievements. Although she recognizes her talents and creative voice brought her to this moment, she also credits much of her success to her network\u2014her community. \u201CWe aren\u2019t designed to do this life alone. Finding your people, finding your community, is one of the most meaningful and important things you can do for yourself,\u201D said Byas. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without the community I found and created.\u201D Read more... Neuroscience alumna publishes in major journal The University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences and Heersink School of Medicine offer five unique interdisciplinary programs that prepare students for the career fields of the future. Shreya MalhotraThe University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences and Heersink School of Medicine offer five unique interdisciplinary programs that prepare students for the career fields of the future. Although these programs are relatively new, several cohorts of students have already attained their degrees. As students continue to graduate from these innovative programs, the College of Arts and Sciences will highlight their achievements and next steps. Shreya Malhotra is a Spring 2020 graduate of the Undergraduate Neuroscience Program. The program allows students to build knowledge and prepare for medical school. It also provides students with laboratory- and literature-based research experiences. Malhotra excelled in the program, and, during her senior year, she published her research in the Journal of Neuroscience, a top-tier journal in the field of neuroscience. Malhotra was the first author on the paper which is entitled, \u201CClimbing Fiber-Mediated Spillover Transmission to Interneurons Is Regulated by EAAT4.\u201D The co-authors on the paper include Gokulakrishna Banumurthy, Reagan L. Pennock, Jada H. Vaden, Izumi Sugihara, Linda Overstreet-Wadiche and Jacques I. Wadiche. Malhotra and her faculty advisor Jacques Wadiche, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Neurobiology in the Heersink School of Medicine, recently crafted a significance statement on the research. According to Malhotra and Wadiche, \u201CAlthough the cerebellum appears to be a uniform structured region, it exhibits a striped pattern of gene expression aptly named after a protein called Zebrin. These stripes may delineate different connectivity with the rest of the brain allowing the cerebellum to act beyond its designated role in motor control. Here we find that the protein levels of EAAT4, a glutamate transporter, follow the Zebrin pattern to cause differences in glutamate signaling across stripes. These results show a new functional difference in cerebellar information processing between stripes and may have implications for understanding the role of the cerebellum in motor control and cognition.\u201D Malhotra is now pursuing her M.D.\/Ph.D. at Stanford\u2019s School of Medicine. \u201CTo publish a first author paper as an undergraduate is a notable achievement, but Shreya\u2019s accomplishment is even more significant considering her work was published in one of the top journals in our field,\u201D said Cristin Gavin, Ph.D., co-director of the Undergraduate Neuroscience Program. \u201CThis indicates not only the high quality of the science, but also the impact of the intellectual advance.\u201D You can access the paper here.

Karla KhodanianInspiration can strike when you least expect it\u2014even while waiting in line for a coffee. \u201CI was 14 years old in line at a Starbucks, and I overheard the girl in front of me tell her friend that she was going to major in public relations,\u201D said Karla Khodanian, managing partner at the Birmingham Business Alliance. \u201CI went home that night, and I Googled public relations and landed on the Wikipedia page for it. I thought it sounded amazing.\u201D Although high school students often change their minds about college majors, Khodanian never wavered from her newfound passion for PR and storytelling. \u201CEvery campus tour, everything I did after that, I was looking at schools\u2019 communications departments,\u201D said Khodanian. \u201CI never had a moment of doubt\u2026 I knew it, stuck with it, and I loved it.\u201D Khodanian grew up in Madison, Alabama, and, while exploring college options, she sought out a change of scenery. After spending years in a suburb of Huntsville, she was ready to be in a city rich with culture, energy, and opportunity. Thankfully, during her numerous campus visits, she included the University of Alabama at Birmingham on her list. Once she arrived in Birmingham, her next step was clear. \u201CI chose UAB very early in my senior year of high school because I loved the campus\u2014I loved the energy of being in a city,\u201D said Khodanian. She started at UAB in 2010 and thrived in the Department of Communication Studies. She also worked with several other units and groups across campus, including Blaze Productions and UAB Digital Media. At the same time, she embraced opportunities to get to know her new city and build a network of like-minded colleagues, mentors, and friends. This commitment to community led her to intern with American Idol star Ruben Studdard, the legendary music venue Bottletree Cafe in Avondale, and the Woodlawn Foundation. \u201CIt got me outside of the campus bubble and into the community,\u201D said Khodanian. \u201CI learned a lot of practical applications for how to be a strong communicator. The sharpest tool in my toolkit is knowing how to communicate broadly to a big audience.\u201D Khodanian went on to graduate with a B.A. in Communication Studies with a Public Relations Specialization in 2014. She also earned minors in sociology and marketing. Soon after graduation, Khodanian decided to stay in Birmingham and start her career in PR. \u201CI chose to stay in Birmingham because I knew it would be a phenomenal place to build my career,\u201D said Khodanian. \u201CI didn\u2019t want to lose the valuable relationships I built as an undergrad.\u201D Seven years later, she\u2019s found a way to successfully meld her love for community with her knack for storytelling, relationship-building, and brand development. As a managing partner at the Birmingham Business Alliance\u2014the lead economic development organization for the Birmingham seven-county region\u2014Khodanian currently focuses on investor relations and member engagement. Through this work, she connects businesses to the Alliance\u2019s mission of growing more and better jobs in the region. When Khodanian first arrived at the Alliance in 2019, she was responsible for attracting talented people to live and work in Birmingham. Her efforts culminated in a milestone project entitled OnBoard Birmingham. \u201CIt\u2019s really cool to have a job that helps me build the city that helped build me. I\u2019m really proud of OnBoard Birmingham, which is the talent brand [of the Alliance],\u201D said Khodanian. \u201CI got to be a part of concepting and developing the project. It was something I started as a consultant and freelancer, then carried it into full-time work. I got the opportunity because of my depth of knowledge of the community and my passion for bringing more people into the community.\u201D In a way, the website for OnBoard Birmingham is the perfect distillation of Khodanian\u2019s journey. It is a celebration of all things Birmingham, and it\u2019s a digital space where people can start building their own networks and relationships\u2014something Khodanian encourages current CAS students to prioritize. \u201CTake the time to build relationships with everyone,\u201D said Khodanian. \u201CWhether it\u2019s your advisor, professor, peer, or someone in the community, those relationships are gold.\u201D Read more... An interview with Ashley M. Jones, the next Alabama Poet Laureate Ashley M. Jones, an alumna of the UAB Department of English, was recently appointed to serve as the next Poet Laureate of Alabama. Ashley M. Jones, an alumna of the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of English, was recently appointed to serve as the next Poet Laureate of Alabama. She holds an MFA from Florida International University and currently lives in Birmingham, where she teaches creative writing at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. She also co-directs PEN Birmingham , is the founding director of the Magic City Poetry Festival , is part of the Core Faculty of the Converse College Low Residency MFA Program, and recently served as guest editor for Poetry Magazine . Her collections include Magic City Gospel, dark \/\/ thing, and Reparations Now! Ashley M. Jones, Poet Laureate of AlabamaSo, how does it feel to be the next Alabama Poet Laureate? Jones: It feels really amazing. I'm very grateful that people trust me to do the job, you know. And I'm obviously very proud to be a Black woman doing the job. I'm the first person of color ever to hold the position in the history of our state, which is something that we need to definitely contend with\u2026I'm just very excited to serve and to represent this really amazing community of writers\u2026I want our state to be a premier literary destination. If you want to elaborate on this, what does it mean to be the first Black woman to hold this position? Jones: It means a lot. It's not lost on me that is taken 91 years for this to occur\u2026 Thinking back to being a young person and looking for those role models who looked like me\u2014that was so important to see, you know. I will always remember my first-grade teacher, Ms. Hafeezah Abdur-Rasheed at EPIC elementary school, because she just was so incredible, and for me to see a Black woman who was so smart, so just on point, always\u2026And of course, having my mom be an example to me\u2014those things matter, you know. To have someone who looks like you, who shares your experience, doing the things that you dream of doing\u2026 So, I'm hoping that by me existing, as whatever it is that I am, and holding whatever title that I hold, maybe that can help someone else to feel more possible. What are your thoughts on representation in literature in society? Jones: Yeah, I think representation is so very important\u2026 For me reading a poem or a novel about Black people by a Black person means more, perhaps\u2026Makes you feel that you can actually tell your own story. If we think back to the slave narratives\u2026sometimes there had to be a preface written by their white benefactor, to say that this is all good; I signed off on it. That does something to a Black reader\u2014and as a White reader actually\u2014you\u2019re being sent the message that this person's voice is only valid because somebody else said it is. But if instead the book is written by the person and we believe it just because they have written it, that says a lot as well\u2026I'd like to walk into the mirror of literature and see myself reflected back. Do you have any thoughts on or suggestions for how we answer the deep issues in our state and country\u2019s history? Jones: I've always been so focused on pointing out what actually happened and on operating in truths only, not in your imagined history\u2026[The system] was made to hurt people\u2014So, with something like this, you know, 91 years of poets laureate and now the first non-white person holding it, I think if we all kind of sit with that for a moment\u2026And then, engaging the full community, instead of staying in your little silo\u2026I think work like that is what can help, because obviously we can't fix the century it took to have somebody hold this position, but we can move forward in a meaningful way. Do you consider yourself to be a feminist? Jones: Yes. I consider myself to be a feminist in the lineage of people like Audre Lorde or bell hooks, which is very important to say\u2026Feminism has also struggled with its ties to the white patriarchy. So, I follow an intersectional of feminist model, which allows me to celebrate the issues of my people within the framework of feminism\u2026 We have to celebrate those differences that we have, and not play into those structures that oppress in the first place. What advice would you give to young poets? Jones: First of all, you're already a poet. Even if you just wrote one poem, you're a poet already. There's not an application process\u2026I also tell students \u201CYour work is already complete.\u201D When you write it, no matter what draft it is, it's complete. So, if we're workshopping it, we're not trying to fix it or make it complete. We're just refining what's already there\u2026 So, I would just tell them to learn to value themselves, because that's the thing is going to carry them through. If I had not realized that being Ashley Jones was enough, I would not be sitting here as Poet Laureate of Alabama. How do you feel that relates to something like publishing? Jones: I'll start by saying, the reason I'm able to even think of it that way, I think it's because I teach from a feminist perspective. Because this idea that we are having to work enough or work to a certain level: that's a patriarchal idea. It's not serving any of us well, you know\u2026 And as far as submitting to journals, I mean, that's such a subjective process. You just don't know\u2026I encourage the students to submit any place they want to do. But I also try to be realistic with them as well. Like if you're looking to build up your publication history, try smaller journals first. They have less submissions to go through, so they might actually see your work and be able to actually spend time with it. And if they\u2019re submitting to a journal and they're like, \u201Coh, but I'm just in high school. Should I let them know that's where I am?\u201D I say, \u201Cwell first of all, it doesn't matter where you are: if a poem\u2019s good, a poem\u2019s good.\u201D If they're really doing their job like they\u2019re supposed to, they're not going to be looking at what age you are. Who have been some of your main influences? Jones: I always loved listening to my family speak. Like, I mentioned earlier, if you speak Southern, that's poetry. So like hearing grandmothers, aunts, uncles, mom, dad, whatever, speaking; that's always been amazing to me. As far as poets go, you know, Eloise Greenfield was my entry into poetry, then Rita Dove and Lucile Clifton. Kevin Young was huge for me in college\u2026 And now it's a lot of my peers and colleagues, who inspire me a lot. And Jacqueline Trimble, who is in Montgomery, Alabama; she is a huge inspiration to me\u2026And then my students inspire me all the time. They are just so creative. When the student is allowed to truly explore and to feel safe in that exploration, they are going to create some of the most incredible, innovative, thought-provoking, emotional pieces that anyone's ever seen. How are you feeling about the release of your third collection? Jones: I feel so excited. I love all my book children equally, but this book, I think, is truly the one where I feel the most myself. And I felt that I didn't have to prove anything anymore. I'm just writing as me\u2026I feel like I'm my most self-actualized in life, so in this book I am also my most self-actualized on the page. What are some of the projects you're working on right now? Jones: Well, I am releasing my book [Reparations Now!]\u2026I'm also trying to move into the prose space. I'm trying to write a memoir. I have a few essays out from that already\u2026I'm thinking of doing some [essays] that are partially personal essay and partially critical essay. The Magic City Poetry Festival slogan this year was \u201Cpoetry is for everybody\u201D and you mentioned bell hooks earlier, so I wanted to know, what do you mean by \u201Cpoetry is for everybody?\u201D Jones: Well, I mean exactly what it says: poetry is for every single person. There is a belief, I think, that poems have to be super hard to understand and they're just for the learned of us. But that's not true. Everybody interacts with poetry on a daily basis, you know\u2026For me and for the MCPF, we are trying to make sure that everybody knows they have access to this art form and that it can be helpful to them\u2026 That's what I love about some of my poetry heroes, like sister Sonia [Sanchez], who I met. She made me a cup of tea\u2014like if you understand what this woman has done in life\u2026all the gifts she has bestowed upon the world. She deserves all the respect ever\u2014The fact that she made little old me, little Ashley from Alabama, a cup of tea, with her own hands? Okay. That to me is the spirit of \u201Cpoetry is for everybody,\u201D you know\u2026And that's the kind of thing that I want to spread everywhere. I want us to feel like we're all fighting the same fight. We're all here together. What are some of your favorite moments from your writing career so far? The first one deals with my dad. He passed this year, which still seems very not real\u2026When he was still alive, I was commissioned to write a poem for the Southern Foodways Alliance, because they were having their annual meeting here in Birmingham. So, I decided I was going to write about my dad's gardening. So, I interviewed him, and he told me all these stories about gardening as a child and how they did it out of necessity back then\u2026We\u2019ve always had a garden in our backyard and eaten all these amazing vegetables and fruits that my dad has grown. So, I wrote this poem about him, called \u201CPhotosynthesis,\u201D and I invited my parents to come\u2026he had never heard it. And it was like right after his birthday too, so I was sneaky\u2026So, I do my last poem, which is the poem for him\u2014and in this poem, I talked about gardening and how he has taken care of us\u2014and is still taking care of us. I mean, we ate his harvest after he passed away\u2026There are so many ways that he planted things for us to reap forever. At the time I didn't know that. I was just writing a poem\u2026So, I read the poem. And I looked out to the audience\u2014and my dad was not a man who cried very often, at least not in front of us. I maybe saw him cry like one time in life, maybe like one and a half\u2014but I looked up and my dad was wiping his eyes, and my mom was like \u2018he was crying. He was crying!\u201D and I felt so proud. I was like wow, first of all, I got him [laughs]. But, also, I'm so glad I was able to. There's this phrase \u201Cgive people their flowers while they yet live.\u201D I could give him flowers, right in front of him. I could tell this group of people, \u201CMy dad's awesome. Here is why.\u201D I could tell my dad, \u201CYou're awesome, Here is why,\u201D you know. And all of that just from writing a poem.

I am Arts and Sciences: Alex LaGanke When Alex LaGanke, staff attorney at Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, left her hometown of Cullman to attend UAB, she quickly started to see the world through a new lens. Alex LaGanke (left) walking at Railroad Park with Ron McKeithen (right) and University of Alabama Law Intern Allen Slater (center) after filing a petition for a client who was subsequently released in June 2021.When Alex LaGanke, staff attorney at Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, left her hometown of Cullman to attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham, she quickly started to see the world through a new lens. \u201CI moved to UAB and gained perspective\u2014I was surrounded by\u2026 so many different people, perspectives, and conversations,\u201D said LaGanke. \u201CI developed a better understanding for how the world works.\u201D As her worldview expanded, she developed a passion for humanitarian work and decided to pursue a B.A. in International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. As she approached graduation, LaGanke was determined to find a career path where she could help people meet their basic needs. Thankfully, during her final semester at UAB, she got the chance to work on an innovative pilot program with the Alabama Association of Nonprofits (AAN), a membership-based organization that supports Alabama's nonprofit sector. During the pilot, AAN matched students with nonprofit organizations that were pursuing the Standards for Excellence endorsement\u2014an endorsement that consists of a series of benchmarks that ensure high ethical standards within organizations. LaGanke was paired with the Court Appointed Special Advocate Program (CASA), a program in Jefferson County which trains community volunteers to provide support and advocate for dependent children involved in neglect or abuse cases. Through this experience, she developed a longstanding connection with CASA, a keen understanding of the value of the AAN\u2019s website (specifically, the jobs board), and a newfound interest in public administration. \u201C[After graduation] I knew that I wanted to do nonprofit work,\u201D said LaGanke. \u201CI would look on AAN\u2019s jobs site, literally daily. One day, I stumbled across a program coordinator position for M-Power Ministries in Avondale.\u201D M-Power is a nonprofit that provides education and health services to people impacted by poverty, and, at the time, the organization needed someone to coordinate direct services for learners participating in the adult basic education program. The organization selected LaGanke for the role, and she quickly learned the value and importance of relationship-building. \u201CI processed 160 students throughout my time there. I realized if I\u2019m going to build relationships with these people, I couldn\u2019t just focus on education,\u201D said LaGanke. \u201CI had to connect people with resources so they could be successful in their education.\u201D Between LaGanke\u2019s experience with CASA and M-Power, she started to uncover a vision for the future. She knew she wanted to serve the people of Birmingham, and, to do so, she believed she needed to focus on law and policy reform. Her realization led her back to UAB\u2014specifically, the Department of Political Science and Public Administration. \u201CI\u2019m such a proud UAB alum,\u201D said LaGanke. \u201CI didn\u2019t apply anywhere else. I didn\u2019t want to leave Birmingham.\u201D LaGanke enrolled in the Master of Public Administration\/Juris Doctorate Dual Degree Program (a partnership between UAB and Samford University\u2019s Cumberland School of Law). While studying in the program, LaGanke learned to analyze and communicate about data\u2014a skillset that serves her well in her current role as a staff attorney with Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit that works to achieve justice and equity for all Alabamians. \u201CMy work revolves around Alabama\u2019s Habitual Felony Offender Act,\u201D said LaGanke. \u201CCombatting excessively punitive laws in the State of Alabama is challenging, but UAB\u2019s MPA program has provided me with the basic skills and tools necessary to approach complex policy issues effectively and strategically.\u201D LaGanke\u2019s casework and research with Alabama Appleseed has sparked life-changing outcomes for four people, including Ronald McKeithen. McKeithen was convicted of first-degree robbery in 1984 and sentenced to life in prison. Through LaGanke\u2019s efforts\u2014and the work and support of many others\u2014McKeithen was released from prison, and, in December 2020, he successfully re-entered the community. Now, he is working with Alabama Appleseed on its re-entry efforts and also creating art, which will be featured in the Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration exhibit at UAB\u2019s Abroms-Engel Institute for the Visual Arts. A detailed account of McKeithen\u2019s journey is available here. LaGanke also supports community re-entry efforts for people who were formerly incarcerated. Her varied responsibilities include everything from helping people as they get a new Social Security card to replacing a flat tire. In this work, she continues to see the importance of policy reform and the need for additional research and advocacy. \u201CI\u2019m really proud that our organization is able to funnel resources and time towards helping our clients be successful beyond our legal representation,\u201D said LaGanke. As she looks to the future and seeks systemic change through casework, research, advocacy, and policy reform, she continues to emphasize an essential skill she nurtured during her time at UAB and with M-Power\u2014building relationships.

For Angelo Della Manna, Director of the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, both skills came into focus during his time studying in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice. When building something from the ground up, it\u2019s valuable for the builder to be detail-oriented and driven. For Angelo Della Manna, Director of the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, both skills came into focus during his time studying in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice. \u201CHaving attention to detail is an extremely important skill in Forensic Science,\u201D said Della Manna. \u201CThat is one of the best things I learned at UAB.\u201D Della Manna\u2019s journey to UAB set the tone for his future professional endeavors. In 1991, during his senior year studying chemistry at the University of Toronto, he purchased a plane ticket and traveled from Canada to the United States to attend the American Academy of Forensic Sciences conference. At that conference, he scheduled a meeting with faculty members from UAB\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice. \u201CI wanted to see, as an international student, if it was possible for me to come [to UAB],\u201D said Della Manna. Della Manna met with Fred Smith, Ph.D., and Ray Liu, Ph.D. Both former faculty members were impressed with the young, analytical chemist\u2019s drive and willingness to travel to the conference on his own dime. During the conversation, they encouraged Della Manna to take the GRE and asked him to share his transcripts. Soon after his journey to the conference, Della Manna was accepted into the forensic science graduate program at UAB. At the time, it was one of the few programs of its kind in the country. Della Manna took advantage of the burgeoning field of study and sought out an internship to obtain practical experience and work alongside forensic scientists. \u201CYou\u2019ve got to be deliberate and intentional,\u201D said Della Manna. \u201CHaving that internship was very valuable to me and helped teach me that skill.\u201D At the time, Della Manna was also nurturing a long-distance relationship with his future wife, Debbie, who he met in Canada. Little did he know, she would later move to Birmingham to pursue her master\u2019s in basic medical sciences, and, eventually, become a cancer researcher in the School of Medicine\u2019s Department of Radiation Oncology. \u201CJust having her in the same zip code was a win,\u201D said Della Manna. After earning his M.S. in Forensic Science, Della Manna started his career as an hourly laborer position with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences (ADFS), the second oldest crime lab system in the country. With a deep interest in forensic biology and a background in DNA techniques from UAB, he found an opportunity to build something within the ADFS. \u201CI was fortunate that I had that background,\u201D said Della Manna. \u201CIt was a technology that was just starting here in Alabama\u2026 We saw early on that DNA could be revolutionary in forensic science.\u201D And it was. Through his tireless efforts, Della Manna and others built a DNA program within the ADFS, and, in turn, put Alabama on the map. In May 1994, the Alabama legislature took notice of the importance of forensic DNA testing and passed the Alabama DNA Database Law, which allowed Della Manna to move faster and help ADFS develop a national reputation. \u201CThe application of new technology has always been fascinating to me,\u201D said Della Manna. \u201CIt allowed Alabama to be at the forefront, on the cutting-edge, of DNA technology.\u201D Nearly 30 years later, Della Manna now serves as the Director of the ADFS and has helped build the only internationally accredited provider of forensic laboratory services in the state. Along the way, other agencies and organizations have taken notice of his knowledge and talents \u2014 including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). \u201CI was appointed by the FBI to the Executive Board on DNA Analysis Methods,\u201D said Della Manna. \u201CWe helped set the national standard for forensic science.\u201D The FBI also encouraged CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes to film a segment about the ADFS\u2019 work, an experience that Della Manna cherishes. Given some of ADFS\u2019 recent statistics and outcomes, it\u2019s no surprise why the agency values Della Manna\u2019s expertise. Last year, his lab helped solve 806 cold cases, leading the country in the number of cases solved per capita. Now, Della Manna is ready to support and train the next generation of forensic scientists. He strongly advocates for work-based learning experiences and internships, and he is quick to offer advice to students who work in his office. \u201CAlways look for opportunities to give back,\u201D Della Manna often tells students and interns. \u201CAs you look for your own career path, be patient. Let the body of your work develop your reputation.\u201D Read more... I am Arts and Sciences: Kristin Powell Sometimes, people find themselves pursuing unexpected career pathways. According to Kristin Powell, Ph.D., organizational consultant for Blankenship & Seay Consulting Group, the knowledge and skills she attained while studying in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of Psychology prepared her for any career \u2014 regardless of the field or subject matter. Sometimes, people find themselves pursuing unexpected career pathways. According to Kristin Powell, Ph.D., organizational consultant for Blankenship & Seay Consulting Group, the knowledge and skills she attained while studying in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of Psychology prepared her for any career \u2014 regardless of the field or subject matter. \u201CI got my foundation at UAB,\u201D said Powell. \u201CI have the basic skills that I needed to be successful in any role. That can give you a lot of confidence.\u201D Powell began building her skills (and confidence) in her hometown, Montgomery, Alabama. After graduating from St. Jude Educational Institute, she decided to pursue a bachelor\u2019s in psychology at Auburn University at Montgomery and earned her degree in 2000. Throughout her formative years, Powell nurtured a connection with the city of Birmingham and, subsequently, UAB. \u201CGrowing up in Montgomery, coming to Birmingham was like coming to the big city,\u201D said Powell. \u201CWhen I became older, I learned more about the training that goes on at UAB and the medical community, which is a large part of the university... Also, my father received medical treatment at the Kirklin Clinic.\u201D Kristin Powell, Ph.D.Powell witnessed the extraordinary care her father received at The Kirklin Clinic of UAB Hospital, which inspired her to consider pursuing her doctorate in psychology at UAB. Through the university\u2019s Department of Psychology, she saw an opportunity to nurture a research foundation while also attaining a clinical education. \u201CI was interested in learning about\u2026 the health psychology aspect of mental health,\u201D said Powell. Although she applied for numerous graduate programs across the country, UAB was at the top of her list. Soon after applying to UAB, Powell was accepted into the Ph.D. program, and she received a Comprehensive Minority Faculty and Student Development Fellowship. According to Powell, the fellowship was a game-changer. \u201CIt afforded me the opportunity to study without having the financial worries of how I was going to fund my doctoral education,\u201D said Powell. She thrived in the program and was mentored by Jesse B. Milby, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of the Department of Psychology. \u201CI always felt very welcomed by him,\u201D said Powell. After she earned her Ph.D. in Clinical\/Medical Psychology from UAB in 2006, Powell moved to Boston and participated in a year-long post-doctoral fellowship with the National Center for PTSD. After completing her fellowship and working in Boston for three years, Powell started a position with the Tuscaloosa Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center where she worked in a training director and PTSD team lead role and later transferred to the Birmingham VA Medical Center. Powell spent the last four years of her 14-year VA career as a national program manager, responsible for leading a team that developed and implemented programs and initiatives supported by VA Central Office. \u201CI helped lead and coordinate a national evidence-based mental health training program for the entire VA,\u201D said Powell. \u201CIt really extended my reach. People would come back to me and say, \u2018What your training program taught me to do helped me to make a difference in someone else\u2019s life.\u2019\u201D Powell made a profound impact during her time at the VA \u2014 that said, after a decade-and-a-half in her role, she decided to make a significant career pivot. She leaned on her transportable skills \u2014 specifically in assessment, communication, relationship-building, and problem-solving \u2014 and moved to a role in the private sector with Blankenship & Seay Consulting Group, a consultancy that delivers assessment-based psychological consulting services to companies. Powell is enjoying her new career as an organizational consultant, through which she helps employees and leaders develop their essential skills. Moving forward, she aims to encourage future alumni of the College of Arts and Sciences to celebrate opportunities to pursue unexpected career pathways and leverage their talents across sectors. \u201CDon\u2019t let anything limit you,\u201D said Powell. \u201CDon\u2019t let anything box you in.\u201D Read more... Uncovering the power of human rights While growing up in Birmingham, Katie Fagan lived a few blocks away from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Although both of her parents graduated from UAB\u2019s School of Medicine, attending the university was not part of Fagan\u2019s long-term plan. At least not at first. While growing up in Birmingham, Katie Fagan lived a few blocks away from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Although both of her parents graduated from UAB\u2019s School of Medicine, attending the university was not part of Fagan\u2019s long-term plan. At least not at first. \u201CI wanted a bit more distance,\u201D said Fagan, AmeriCorps VISTA and volunteer engagement member for the Black Warrior Riverkeeper, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting clean water for the sake of public health, recreation, and wildlife habitat throughout the Black Warrior River watershed. Fagan\u2019s academic journey helped her achieve that desired distance. After studying sociology at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, she made her way across the Atlantic Ocean to the University of Manchester where she earned her Master of Science in Environmental Governance. That\u2019s also where she met Elliot Nicholson-Cox. Fagan and Nicholson-Cox connected quickly and uncovered a shared interest in human rights and peace studies. Nicholson-Cox, an alumnus of the University of Bradford\u2019s Peace and Development Studies program, was teaching full-time and planning his next academic step. While crafting his vision for the future and exploring his evolving interest in anthropology, he decided to visit Fagan while she was back in Birmingham spending time with her family. During his trip to Birmingham, Nicholson-Cox was determined to meet Douglas P. Fry, Ph.D., a prominent anthropologist and former chair of the UAB Department of Anthropology. \u201CDr. Fry was instrumental in establishing the Anthropology of Peace and Human Rights program [at UAB],\u201D said Nicholson-Cox. \u201CWe chatted and stayed in touch, and he invited me to apply for the program.\u201D Nicholson-Cox followed Fry\u2019s recommendation and was accepted into the graduate program. Fagan also started exploring the possibility of returning home, given her burgeoning relationship with Nicholson-Cox and deepening interest in peace studies. \u201CAll of my research led me to focus on issues of justice and environmental justice,\u201D said Fagan. \u201CI had been around Elliot and his friends who had all done peace studies in undergrad and had been immersed in it. I thought it [UAB\u2019s Anthropology of Peace and Human Rights graduate program] was another master\u2019s that would really help push my research.\u201D Within a year, both Nicholson-Cox and Fagan had moved from England to Alabama and enrolled in the APHR program. Although they shared several foundational classes, they uncovered their own specific interests within the program. Fagan embraced her return to Alabama and sought opportunities to ground her research and work in her home state through interdisciplinary courses in public policy and public health and internship opportunities with the Jefferson County Memorial Project and the Institute for Human Rights. As Fagan developed her Birmingham network and continued to refine her focus on public participation in environmental justice cases (with a focus on clean water issues in North Birmingham), Nicholson-Cox found ways to pursue his specific interest in the ways education systems work in relation to peace and conflict in local communities. \u201CKatie was able to spend lots of time doing research that was specific to Birmingham,\u201D said Nicholson-Cox. \u201CWhile I was doing more classically academic work.\u201D Both Nicholson-Cox and Fagan graduated from the APHR program in 2020, and, now, their specific interests are informing their respective post-graduation paths. At the moment, Nicholson-Cox is exploring Ph.D. programs that will allow him to further build on his master\u2019s thesis, which focuses on the way education was used as a tool of colonial Spain in Mexico from the 16th century up to today. He will also teach the Intro to Peace Studies course at UAB in Fall 2021. Fagan, on the other hand, is working with the Black Warrior Riverkeeper and serving on junior boards for both the Birmingham Botanical Gardens and the Alabama Rivers Alliance. Throughout her daily work and volunteer activities, Fagan draws on her knowledge and skills from the APHR program, including conflict resolution and conflict transformation. \u201CI\u2019m still using all of my research. [The APHR program] is very multidisciplinary,\u201D said Fagan. \u201CI\u2019m currently on junior boards for the Botanical Gardens and the Alabama Rivers Alliance and discussions about equity and justice are definitely a part of that work. I\u2019ve been able to bring a lot of theories from the program out to these groups, which has really helped me.\u201D According to Peter Verbeek, Ph.D., associate professor and program director in the Department of Anthropology, both students made a lasting impact on the APHR program. \u201CAccess to a healthy and sustainable environment and to age-appropriate education are not privileges but rights that are integral to the basic human rights framework that much of the world has pledged to uphold,\u201D said Verbeek. \u201CKatie Fagan and Elliott Nicholson-Cox, two distinguished alumni of the APHR program, have dedicated much of their work in APHR on studying these basic rights and how working to advance them equals working for positive peace. Their contributions to APHR have been multifold and much appreciated, and all of us in the UAB Department of Anthropology have great expectations for their future careers as scholars and activists of peace.\u201D It\u2019s clear that both Fagan and Nicholson-Cox will carry their knowledge and networks with them throughout their careers and future academic pursuits. It\u2019s also clear that the APHR program profoundly influenced the ways in which both alumni see the world. When prompted to reflect on and consider the importance of the APHR program and human rights education more broadly, Nicholson-Cox offered a powerful insight: \u201CRather than talking about abstract political ideas\u2026 using human rights as a frame grounds everything in human needs that just makes sense to people. We all have a right to a safe and clean house, good food, drinking water, to have our voice heard when we choose to speak. These are all very common-sense ideas that people have for what would make a just and peaceful society.\u201D Fagan agrees. \u201CIt\u2019s collaborative. Peace is a lot more holistic and something to reach for than I think people realize. It impacts everything. There\u2019s nothing outside of the discussion of peace and human rights,\u201D said Fagan.

For Eric Teoh, director of statistical services at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the connection between math and lifesaving work is crystal clear. For students who study math in college, the notion of saving lives with their knowledge may seem distant \u2014 maybe even far-fetched. For Eric Teoh, director of statistical services at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the connection between math and lifesaving work is crystal clear. That was not always the case, though. In high school, Teoh had a complicated relationship with mathematics. Eric Teoh \u201CI wasn\u2019t very good at math until I got to college,\u201D said Teoh. \u201CI let it intimidate me.\u201D Teoh admits that he did not have a positive attitude about the discipline prior to college. However, when the time came to declare a major at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, he unexpectedly selected the subject that posed numerous challenges for him in high school. \u201CAt the time, I thought to myself, \u2018I can do anything \u2014 I\u2019ll major in math,\u2019\u201D said Teoh. This new outlook on life (and education) prompted a different mindset for Teoh. Instead of allowing math to get the best of him, he found himself working harder and challenging himself to master the discipline. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. \u201CThe faculty in the Department of Mathematics took a chance on me,\u201D said Teoh. \u201CBetween them taking a chance on me and a shift in my attitude, I made it work.\u201D Right after being accepted to UAB, Teoh was also accepted into the Mathematics Fast Track Program. Through the program, Teoh earned both a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics in only four years. Along the way, he also took a few extra courses in a variety of subjects, including more than were required for him to earn a minor in chemistry. All in a day\u2019s work for Teoh. \u201CI think UAB was an excellent place to learn,\u201D said Teoh. \u201CWe learned a lot of important skills for work and life in general. We learned to think independently.\u201D After graduating from UAB, Teoh enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to pursue a Ph.D. in Biostatistics. Although the program was engaging, Teoh started reevaluating his future with a new focus on starting a career that would allow him to save lives. His reflective mindset motivated him to leave Chapel Hill and accept a role as a data analyst with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). According to Teoh, IIHS \u2014 an independent, nonprofit scientific and educational organization dedicated to reducing deaths, injuries, and property damage from motor vehicle crashes \u2014 aligned with his vision, values, and talents. Now, 15 years after taking the job with IIHS, Teoh has a clear perspective on the transportable skills he developed while at UAB and the ways in which his work improves the world. \u201CI\u2019ve learned the value of simplicity,\u201D said Teoh. \u201CWe try to use the simplest scientifically sound analysis methods so everyone can understand our work and use it to make better decisions.\u201D When Teoh reflects on his professional accomplishments, he immediately circles back to the values that drove him to leave Chapel Hill and start his job with IIHS: saving lives and reducing harm. \u201CThere are no panaceas or silver bullets in this field, so every effective countermeasure is important,\u201D said Teoh. \u201CSome of the biggest ones from my research studies include antilock braking systems on motorcycles, front crash prevention technology on large trucks, graduated driver licensing laws for teenage drivers, and vehicle roof strength in rollover crashes.\u201D Teoh\u2019s journey is full of valuable lessons \u2014 that said, there is one theme in particular that he emphasizes when speaking with students who are crafting their visions for the future. \u201CDo not be afraid of changing your mind on future plans,\u201D said Teoh. \u201C[If you do change your mind] do so in a way that builds off of what you\u2019ve already accomplished. I changed my mind substantially at least a couple times and, looking back, I\u2019m glad I did each time.\u201D Read more...

Leigh Willis, Ph.D.In 1997, Leigh Willis, Ph.D., a rising senior studying sociology at Albion College in Albion, Michigan, encountered a life-changing document. It was an interest form about a graduate program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"UAB\u2019s Department of Sociology sent the information to my department [at Albion],\u201D said Willis. \u201CI completed the form, and, later that summer, UAB invited me to participate in a 10-week paid internship in Birmingham.\u201D Through that program, Willis got the chance to connect with and work alongside faculty and graduate students in the UAB Department of Sociology. He also got the opportunity to participate in an engaged learning experience with the Jefferson County Department of Health. \u201CThe faculty were nurturing and supportive,\u201D said Willis. \u201CI was interested in patterns of health and illness, and [during the internship] I got the chance to interview people at the Jefferson County Department of Health and collect data.\u201D During this experience, his mentors and peers in the department also encouraged him to pursue his Ph.D. at UAB. Willis quickly uncovered his appreciation for the faculty-to-student ratio in the department \u2013 he also learned that UAB had one of the few medical sociology graduate programs in the country. \u201CI received a fellowship with a stipend from the graduate school and stayed in Birmingham,\u201D said Willis. \u201CI started the graduate program and learned the craft and skills of research. I loved the size of the program, because I had a lot of interaction with the faculty.\u201D Willis went on to earn his Master of Arts in Sociology, Master of Public Health, and Doctor of Philosophy in Medical Sociology. During his impressive academic career at UAB, Willis developed many valuable skills, including creative problem solving. \u201CWe were very well-trained,\u201D said Willis. \u201CWe could think big and answer hard and difficult questions for the benefit of mankind.\u201D After earning his Ph.D., Willis became an assistant professor of sociology and African American Studies at the University of Georgia. Then, in 2009, he was hired to serve as a Behavioral Scientist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). When he arrived at the CDC, he discovered he had something in common with several of his coworkers. \u201CThere are several UAB alumni at the CDC,\u201D said Willis. \u201CMany of them studied in the College of Arts and Sciences \u2013 specifically, the Department of Sociology.\u201D Today, Willis is a behavioral scientist at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. He continues to appreciate the value of engaged learning, so he makes an effort to connect current UAB College of Arts and Sciences students with the CDC through internships and research experiences. He also frequently finds opportunities to visit UAB, so he can connect with students and share stories about the impact of his work. He has one career milestone in particular that he enjoys discussing with students. \u201CI was one of the leaders of a team that were finalists for a Health and Human Services Innovates Award,\u201D said Willis. \u201CProjects are submitted from all over HHS and voted on by the general public. Through our project, we created a motion comic to educate people about HIV, because parents said it was needed. We went to HHS headquarters and received recognition for our work from the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\u201D A short clip from the motion comic is available online, and, in 2018, the journal Health Communication published two articles on the innovative project. Willis continues to make a difference through his work, and he encourages current students and recent alumni to do the same. \u201CContinue to work hard.
