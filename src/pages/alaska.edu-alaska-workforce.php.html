UA Workforce Reports Feature Graduate & Employment Outcomes The University of Alaska offers more than 200 programs in workforce development from non-credit industry certifications to advanced degrees. UA and the Department of Labor and Workforce Development collaborated to produce workforce reports on key Alaska industries. The workforce reports illustrate UA graduate outcomes and employment success. Data demonstrates that higher education increases income, reduces unemployment, increases Alaska hire rates and increases job retention. Reports can be used to assess UA programs and graduate outcomes, guide program development and investment and aid students in program selection.
