Over two years, students can earn as much as $33,500, which with planning can cover all of a student\u2019s education expenses. There are also potential grants and financial aid. While not guaranteed, there will be opportunities for the sponsor company to hire graduates as full time employees. Graduates of the AMT program will be equipped with the needed skills and experience that many manufacturing companies are actively seeking. Enter the Workforce as an In-Demand, Skilled Technician The River Region Federation For Advanced Manufacturing Education (F.A.M.E.) program partners students with industry while they take classes at select community colleges. The goal is for students to gain valuable employment experience with manufacturing leaders while also completing their associate degree. The application is due by July 4, 2022! at Noon How To Apply Apply for Admission to Trenholm State Community College at www.trenholmstate.edu\/apply Complete this FAME application. https:\/\/fame-usa.secure-platform.com\/a The application will ask for a 300 \u2013 500-word essay.

Companies select students on a draft system. You have the right to refuse an offer, but there is no guarantee another company will select you. Will I be hired immediately at my sponsor company? Maybe. There is no obligation for the sponsor company to hire you, nor are you obligated to stay after graduation. Several factors are considered in this situation. I\u2019ve never worked in manufacturing. How do I know if this is the right program for me? It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t have any real-world manufacturing experience. Do you like working with your hands? Does the sound of sitting at a desk all day long bore you? Do you have a reputation for being able to take things apart and put them back together? Do you ask \u201CWhy?\u201D when something doesn\u2019t work? If so, this program is likely for you! Application Requirements Applicant must be eligible to take MTH 100 and ENG 101. Must have a desire to work in a manufacturing environment troubleshooting, installing, and maintaining equipment. Must be 18 years of age by June of the application year. Participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) programs such as BEST Robotics, Career Technical coursework or Project Lead the Way is preferred. 1 \/ 3 2 \/ 3 3 \/ 3 ? ?
