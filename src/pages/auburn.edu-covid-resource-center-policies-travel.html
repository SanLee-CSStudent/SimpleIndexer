The CDC recommends delaying travel until you are fully vaccinated. Since most people are not yet vaccinated, and infections continue to spread the risk of transmission remains high, and that risk is heightened by the continued prevalence of new strains of the virus. For the foreseeable future, the global pandemic will continue to affect the safety and feasibility of travel. For personal safety and the safety of others, anyone who chooses to travel should ensure they are in good health and follow important safety protocols in addition to those recommended by the CDC and ADPH. University Travel Domestic Travel for University Business Domestic Travel Guidance Domestic university travel for university business, such as research visits and conference attendance, is permitted at the discretion of the traveling employee\u2019s supervisor. Domestic student travel for academic purposes is permitted at the discretion of the department chair. Domestic student travel that is not for academic purposes, such as travel by registered student organizations, is permitted at the discretion of the Senior Vice President for Student Affairs. What to Know Before Domestic Travel Make sure you are up to date with your COVID-19 vaccine and\/or booster. Check your destination\u2019s COVID-19 situation before traveling. State, tribal, local, and territorial governments may have travel restrictions in place. On Monday, April 18, a federal judge in Florida struck down the federal mask requirement on airplanes, taxis, trains, buses and other public transportation. The decision includes airports, train stations and other transportation hubs. Because of the ruling, the masking order is no longer in effect and the Transportation Security Administration is no longer enforcing it. At this time, it is uncertain whether the decision will be appealed. The CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings. Travelers should check with airlines and public transportation options at their destination for any ongoing safety requirements. If traveling by air, check if your airline requires any testing, vaccination, or other documents. Prepare to be flexible during your trip as restrictions and policies may change during your travel.
