A world-renowned medical center. Five hospitals on campus. That\u2019s right\u2014five. And that whole research thing? That\u2019s really important to us.

Plus, we\u2019ve got opportunities for shadowing and volunteering. Oh, and did we mention UAB is home to Callahan Eye Hospital, one of only two Level 1 ocular trauma centers in the nation with a 24\/7 eye emergency department? In other words, we\u2019ve got a pretty darn good pre-optometry program. Pre-Dentistry Want to be a dentist? Well, UAB is a pretty great place to prepare to become one.
