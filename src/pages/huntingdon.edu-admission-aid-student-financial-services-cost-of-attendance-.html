Recognized among the Best Small Colleges in America (College Consensus), top regional colleges (U.S. News & World Report, Princeton Review), and among U.S. News\u2019 list of Best Values, among other honors, Huntingdon provides a number of benefits to traditional undergraduate students through the Huntingdon Plan.

Meal Plans for Residential Students All Huntingdon College board plans cost the same. The difference in the plans is the number of meals offered in Julia Walker Russell Dining Hall (\u201CThe DH\u201D) versus \u201Cflex\u201D points that can be used in the Scarlet & Grey Shop, the POD, the Hawk Food Trailer, or other Aramark dining or snack facilities. Board Options The 19 \u201CTransferability\u201D Meal Plan: 19 meals per week in the DH, plus $150 in flex-points. The 15 \u201CFlex\u201D Meal Plan: this is the default board plan. 15 of the 19 meals served per week in the dining hall, plus $200 in flex-points. The 10 \u201CFlex\u201D Meal Plan: 10 of the 19 meals served per week in the DH, plus $250 in flex-points. You will automatically be assigned the 15-meal plan and may change to a different plan during the first week of classes. The 19 meals served in the dining hall each week include breakfast, lunch, and dinner Monday through Friday and brunch and dinner on Saturday and Sunday. The board charges include 10% state, county, and city sales tax on food. Dining services and residence halls are closed during holidays. You may purchase additional dollars to be added to your account, accessed through your Student ID\/swipe card, to allow for more purchases in Huntingdon\/ARAMARK dining venues. Commuter Meal Plans The $1,000 Commuter Student Fee includes one Block 30 Commuter Meal Plan. You may choose to add to this meal plan in the following ways: Block 30 \u2013 30 meals and $300 flex points ($500) (one Block 30 Commuter Meal Plan is included in the commuter fee.) You may also add Flex Points to your student account\/ID to be used in any of the dining\/convenience areas or other Aramark dining or snack facilities (ie. Coffee Shop, The POD, etc.). Methods of Aid Distribution Financial Aid offers are normally determined on an annual basis, with one-half of the annual amount of the award being credited to the student\u2019s account during the first semester and the other half during the second semester. Each semester, aid eligibility is finalized after the institution\u2019s official second week report is released. Huntingdon College scholarships and grants are available to full-time degree-seeking traditional undergraduate students only. It is important to know that Huntingdon College scholarship and grant recipients may also be eligible to receive other forms of institutional, federal, and state aid. However, a FAFSA form must be completed so that the Office of Student Financial Services can determine eligibility. All federally-funded aid requires completion of the Free Application of Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is determined from the FAFSA. Cost of attendance is calculated by totaling estimated fees, tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses based on whether a student lives on campus or off-campus. Unmet need is calculated by subtracting the EFC and aid offered from the Cost of Attendance. (Cost of attendance \u2013 EFC \u2013 Aid = Unmet need). Please note that, in general, only one institutional Merit or Honors Scholarship or Participation Award can be offered to a student. Once a student enrolls additional scholarships will not be awarded. Billing Prior to the beginning of each semester, preregistered students and deposited freshmen receive statements of estimated charges and financial aid based on preregistration information. Actual charges may change because of updates to the class schedule, room and board changes, class fees, etc. The estimated balance (after financial aid is applied) is due the first day of classes. Final charges and aid are posted after the second week of classes. Each student signs a promissory note acknowledging his or her understanding of the responsibility to pay all charges incurred during enrollment at Huntingdon College, whether or not these charges are reflected on estimated billings. Students are not permitted to attend classes until their financial affairs are arranged. If a student\u2019s account becomes delinquent, the College may withdraw permission for the student to attend classes. In the event that a student\u2019s account is not paid in full (or satisfactory payments are not being made) by the end of the semester, Huntingdon College reserves the right to withdraw permission for the student to attend classes the next semester until financial arrangements have been made. Payment Plans There are two payment options: Pay the estimated semester balance in full by the stated deadline on the College\u2019s calendar. Enroll in the College\u2019s Deferred Payment Plan (Payments are due according to the payment schedule provided on the Academic Year Bill) The Huntingdon College Deferred Payment Plan allows students and parents to pay educational expenses in monthly installments; the fee for plan enrollment is $250 annually. Students who do not enroll in the Deferred Payment Plan but who do not pay the semester balance in full by the published deadline are charged the $250 Plan Fee annually and are automatically placed on the Deferred Payment Plan. Students who attend only one semester during an academic year are charged the full fee. Students enrolled in the Huntingdon College Deferred Payment Plan receive a payment schedule with the signed promissory note. Failure to remit payment(s) in accordance with the provided statement schedule will result in a late payment fee of $30, charged to the student\u2019s account. A late payment fee is charged for each delinquent payment.
