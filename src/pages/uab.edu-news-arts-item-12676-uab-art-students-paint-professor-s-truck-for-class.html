AT1 AT2 AT3 AT4 AT5 AT6 AT7 AT8 AT9 AT10 AT11 AT12 Photography: Andrea Mabry Students who usually paint on canvas got the chance to try their hands painting a professor\u2019s ride at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Professor of Painting Gary Chapman invited guest artist Michael Swann of Swann Graphics to give a presentation on pinstriping to students in his College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 Department of Art and Art History painting class. Swann does vintage pinstripe restoration work for Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum. Chapman thought it was a good opportunity to get the students out of the classroom and into UAB\u2019s 2300 Studios to paint as a team. The black Ford Ranger truck belongs to Associate Professor Doug Barrett, who teaches graphic design in the Department of Art and Art History. It will be donated to Birmingham\u2019s public radio station WBHM 90.3 FM through its vehicle donation program. Barrett says he has been an avid WBHM listener since 2008 when he came to Birmingham. \u201CWBHM is a wonderful local resource and I have supported it over the years,\u201D Barrett said. \u201CWhen I purchased a new car, donating the old car to WBHM seemed like a logical way to further my support.\u201D Interested in a career in the visual arts? Use UAB\u2019s Find your degree portal to learn more about degrees in the arts. When Chapman suggested using his old truck to teach students about pinstriping, with the help of local expert Swann as the instructor, \u201Cit all clicked,\u201D Barrett said. Class started with a short talk, then Swann prepared simple designs to get the students started. In teams of two or three, the students took over painting UAB and WBHM logos as well as stripes and designs, like skulls, in silver and gold paint. Students were given paint brushes for participating and first, second and third place prizes were awarded, with all participants also being given aprons. The prizes were provided by Forstall Art Supply. To Chapman, the most important part of bringing in the guest artist was exposing his students to a person with an art degree who has created their own career. \u201CWhat is great about Michael Swann is that he developed a skill set of pinstriping with which he can go to rallies and to Barber, but he also does his own work and shows in museums and galleries and on top of that he runs a gallery,\u201D Chapman said. \u201CSo, he has three different business ventures \u2014 just a really great exposure for my students of how people with an art degree can carve out their own career.\u201D Swann works in a variety of mediums and techniques that include painting, drawing, printmaking, airbrushing and pin-striping. He maintains three studios plus a woodworking shop, where he builds his own stretchers, panels and frames. He is Alabama\u2019s ambassador to the Portrait Society of America. WBHM is much more than a radio station \u2014 it is an essential public resource that enlightens and enriches its audience and makes strong connections to communities through journalism that is fair, credible, accurate and honest. Free from commercial and political influence, WBHM seeks to make Birmingham and Alabama a better place to live by educating, engaging and entertaining the people of its metro area and state. WBHM is dedicated to the idea that an informed citizenry is vital to democracy and a thriving economy, and it celebrates diversity, innovation and lifelong learning. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
