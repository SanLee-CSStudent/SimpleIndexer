An internship is a typically one-time work or service experience related to the student\u2019s major or career goal. The internship plan generally involves students working in professional settings under the supervision and monitoring of practicing professionals. Internships can be available in the fall, spring, and\/or summer. Students may earn academic credit, as determined by each UCA major department (please contact internships@uca.edu for more information) Students at all class levels are eligible to participate in internships, depending upon the requirements of your organization. An established duration of an internship is typically, but not limited to, a minimum of 10 weeks. Internships ideally are paid; however, if the internship is unpaid, duties may not replace those of paid employees. Internships can be on a part-time or full-time basis as determined by the site sponsor. How Can I, as a Site Sponsor, Benefit? Many supervisors simply enjoy sharing their expertise and savvy in their roles as professional mentors. In addition, some tangible benefits include: Year-round source of highly motivated pre-professionals Quality candidates for temporary or seasonal positions and projects Freedom for professional staff to pursue more creative projects Flexible, cost-effective workforce not requiring a long-term site sponsor commitment Proven, cost-effective way to recruit and evaluate potential employees According to the 2005 Experiential Education Survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), 75% of employer respondents indicated the primary purpose for them in sponsoring an internship is to recruit entry-level talent. In NACE\u2019s 2019 Internship and Co-Op Report the one-year retention rate for intern hires with internal experience is 68.7%. How Does it Work? As a sponsoring organization, you can offer substantive work experiences that support students\u2019 academic and career goals and for that we are thankful! Please post your internship in Handshake.
