Fields of Interest Meet us at the intersection of technology and art with the Computer Assisted Design (CAD) and Drafting program. This program is great for students who love art, drawing, and using computers. CAD operators create the technical drawings used by architects, surveyors, engineers, or scientists. A CAD operator is also an essential role in civil engineering, where they prepare drawings that are used in planning our infrastructure, like highways, pipelines, or bridges. This program emphasizes current technological needs in the drafting industry and is designed to prepare students for an entry-level career as a CAD operator working for architects, interior designers, or other professionals in related fields. This program will teach you about 2D and 3D computer-aided drafting and design and models utilizing industry-standard CAD, Revit, and BIM software, computer numerical control (CNC) programming, and basic manufacturing processes using American standards (ANSI). You will learn how to produce sketches, layouts, drawings, and various views that are compliant with standard industry practices. Join the Computer Assisted Design and Drafting program today and make it happen! The Right Pathway for You MCC offers Certificates of Completion and Associate Degrees for this program.
