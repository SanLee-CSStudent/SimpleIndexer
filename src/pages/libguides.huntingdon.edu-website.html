This history will be told through the framework of the three waves of feminism, showing how the College's community has responded to women's movements. I will detail on the women who came to Huntingdon, how its community fostered these women and their talents, and how the College molded its students into high-achieving young women who, as alumni, were leading figures in their communities.\" You will find her presentation through this link if you have an @hawks.huntingdon.edu account: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/...\/1oyEzwH2SIWozmbsSCtD...\/view....
