The Center\u2019s academic and career advisors provide intensive and personalized support, including a two-credit course (EXPL 1010) for all new Exploratory majors. In the course, students are exposed to all of Auburn\u2019s colleges and majors, conduct self and career research, and have the opportunity to connect with faculty, staff, and working professionals in areas of personal interest. Students also receive one-on-one academic and career advising during their time in the Exploratory major. While students are exploring, we advise them on core curriculum courses to take to stay on track with their future majors. Our goal is to ensure that students choose a major with confidence while making progress toward their degree. Once students declare their major, the Exploratory team provides full support for our students as they transition into their new college and major. Benefits of Exploratory Personalized academic advising at orientation (Camp War Eagle) to help incoming students efficiently navigate Auburn\u2019s core curriculum. Significant support from the Center\u2019s academic and career advisors. Between class and one-on-one meetings, our staff members have roughly 35 points of contact (at minimum) with each Exploratory student in their first semester. Excellent student to advisor ratios. Small class sections (20 students) in EXPL 1010. The instructor of your EXPL 1010 course also serves as your academic advisor, which provides Exploratory students with a consistent point of contact during their time in our program. Support in transitioning from the Exploratory major to a student\u2019s eventual major of choice.

Exploratory did more than just help me choose a major. It eased my transition into college and taught me numerous life lessons, like understanding how to navigate professional interactions and decision-making. Because of the program\u2019s impact on me, I was able to secure an amazing opportunity post-graduation. - Josh Ourada '19 Contact 101 Mary Martin Hall Auburn University, AL 36849 Phone: 334-844-7277 Email: explore@auburn.edu Office of the Provost Provost Home Auburn University A - Z Index Accessibility AU Access Auburn People Finder Map Privacy Statement Website Feedback ?
