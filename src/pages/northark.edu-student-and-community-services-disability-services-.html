Northark is committed to providing support needed for equal access and equal educational opportunity for each student. If a student has a documented disability that could impact the pursuit of an education, accommodations may be requested by contacting the disability coordinator. The student must request accommodations to receive accommodations. Accommodation plans are created specifically for the student by the disability coordinator. All services comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and with subsequent state and federal legislation. Physical facilities for disabled stakeholder and visitors include the following: Strobes in restrooms, classrooms and public areas activated whenever audible alarms sound Wheelchair lift between the Bradley Student Center and the Pioneer Pavilion Ground floor exits on each floor of the 3-story business building because of the hilly terrain. Door assists on most outdoor exits and designated restrooms Brailed room numbers Ample designated parking including lift van accessible spaces Curb cuts at entrances Wheelchair height water fountains and sinks Wheelchair height computer desks Reduced distraction testing room Accommodation Request Procedure North Arkansas College requests that students seeking accommodations follow the disability accommodations request procedure to ensure that appropriate accommodations are available. Students requesting accommodations should complete the online Disability Services Student Intake Form at least two weeks before the accommodations are needed. This allows time for the process to be completed and ensure accommodations are in place to maximize success. If the student would prefer a paper form, the student may request that form from the Disability Services Coordinator or from the Advising Center. Assistance in completing the form may also be requested from either party. This must be done each semester to request accommodations because student schedules change on a semester basis. Also, accommodations are not retroactive; therefore, students are encouraged to complete the accommodation request process before the start of classes or as early as possible in the semester if the student suspects an accommodation may be needed. After the Disability Services Coordinator (DSC) receives the Disability Services Student Intake Form, appropriate documentation will be requested by the DSC, and an interview with the student may be scheduled to discuss appropriate accommodations and an accommodation plan with be created. Most disabilities require some sort of documentation. Examples include letters from doctors, reports or bills which include a diagnosis, and IEPs that include a diagnosis. After accommodations are agreed upon, the student completes the Student Contract and the DSC creates accommodation letters to be given to the instructors by the student requesting accommodations. The student can elect to receive the accommodation letters by email or in person from the DSC. Regardless of method, it is the student\u2019s responsibility to give the instructor the accommodation letters. The student is expected to visit with the instructor regarding the accommodation letter to ensure that both the student and instructor understand the accommodation and how to proceed through the class. The instructor then completes the receipt of the accommodation letter and submits to the DSC. If the student feels that the accommodation is not being met according to the accommodation letter, then he or she should immediately contact the DSC for assistance. Renewing Accommodations Students requesting accommodations MUST complete the Disability Services Student Intake Form each semester to ensure that the appropriate accommodations are suited for the scheduled courses.
