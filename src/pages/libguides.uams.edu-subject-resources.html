Let us know what you find useful or needs improvement: Feedback Form Overview of Resource Guides: Using the Best Resources Library liaisons have prepared Resource Guides to assist users in finding the best resources for these subject areas. Each library liaison coordinates with a specific college or program to select the most effective and efficient resources to support faculty, students, and staff. As each college or program is different, the liaison will work within the college structure to collaborate with the college administration and programs to maintain a current and relevant Resource Guide. Resource guides are personally developed by the liaison or liaisons to the college or to point out helpful hints including the following: most appropriate databases for searching the literature tips on search terms to use when searching the library catalog or databases relevant mobile apps individual popular ebooks and ebook collections (and how to use them) best tools for clinical care student oriented resources tools for board preparation Frequently, written or video tutorials are included to highlight various functionalities of the resource, e.g. how to successfully download resources such as chapters, images, and videos from ebooks. Each liaison is listed to encourage comments and requests for more information, individual assistance as well as classes or presentations on library and Internet resources. Please check out Liaison Services provided by the Liaison Program to learn about other services provided specifically for faculty, researchers, and clinicians.
