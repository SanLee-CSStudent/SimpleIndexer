Field of Interest Geoscientists seek to understand the Earth\u2019s composition, natural systems, and history. Our understanding of processes such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides, floods, land subsidence, coastal processes, and climate changes have a tremendous impact on human activity and, indeed, human life! Humans depend on Earth\u2019s resources including surface and ground water, soils for growing crops and building materials, fossil and nuclear fuels, metallic and non-metallic building materials. Geoscientists work to find and manage such resources. Deciphering Earth\u2019s long history may provide us with potential insights into our own future. In addition to natural resource companies including the mining and fossil fuel industries, Geologists are routinely employed by research agencies including those in federal, state and local governments as well as non-profit organizations; geologic engineering, hydrological, and environmental consulting firms; and secondary schools, colleges and universities. Most entry level work requires a bachelor\u2019s degree. Graduate degrees are often required for research and supervisory geologists as well as post-secondary faculty positions. Most graduate degrees focus on specialties including but not limited to geochemistry, geophysics, paleontology, planetary geology, geological\/mining\/petroleum engineering, and hydrology. Other fields\/majors such as civil engineering, forestry, sustainability, and environmental sciences either require or strongly recommend some background courses in geology. Many geoscientists spend some time in the field gathering samples, collecting data and\/or determining spatial relationships. An office or laboratory environment is often used for data analysis and synthesis often using computers for the preparation of written reports, maps, and cross sections. If the study of the Earth captivates you, please consider starting your career in the Geological Sciences! Transfer Degree Want to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree? Save money by starting at MCC in manageable, small classes taught by renowned faculty. Our transfer pathways with Arizona universities help you achieve two goals: completing an associate\u2019s degree while also staying on track to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree at your transfer destination. MCC\u2019s university partnerships throughout the nation assure your seamless transition toward a four-year degree.
