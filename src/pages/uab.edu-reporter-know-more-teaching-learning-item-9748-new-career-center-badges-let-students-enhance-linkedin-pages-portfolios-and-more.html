The course also included quizzes to let students check their comprehension. \u201CWe have had great success with the course,\u201D said Dino Martinez, assistant director of the Career Center. \u201CTo date, it has engaged more than 16,400 participants, there have been more than 6,750 quizzes taken, and course modules have been integrated into 117 academic courses all across campus.\u201D Introducing Badge Rewards This month, the UAB Career Center is adding another piece to the program \u2014 digital badges \u201Cto provide students who complete course content with tangible credentials that can be highlighted for future employers,\u201D Martinez said. The new program, Career Center Badge Rewards, is an initiative between the UAB Career Center and UAB eLearning. It uses the Badgr platform, a \u201Cdigital credential network\u201D that has been adopted by a number of organizations, including Microsoft, Walmart and Starbucks, as well as higher-ed institutions such as Virginia Tech and Arizona State University. \u201COur interest in badging came from the increasing literature on using gamification to enhance student learning and engagement,\u201D Martinez said. Badges highlight career readiness The badges can be downloaded and used on LinkedIn (in the optional Licenses & Certifications section), online portfolios, websites and other locations. \u201CEach badge comes with a link that potential employers and others can use to explore exactly what the student has accomplished to earn the badge,\u201D Martinez said. \u201COur goal is for these badges to be used as a mechanism to highlight career readiness when our Blazers engage with employers.\u201D Leveraging LinkedIn Learn more about how to use LinkedIn for career building and networking from Career Center Director Brandon Wright in Leveraging LinkedIn: Build Your Personal Brand & Network, 6:30 p.m. April 28 on Zoom.
