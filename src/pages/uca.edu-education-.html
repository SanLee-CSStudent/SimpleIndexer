Welcome to the UCA College of Education! We are proud to be Arkansas\u2019 premier educator preparation college. We are dedicated to providing exemplary programs for the preparation of professional educators, including teacher preparation for elementary, middle level, and secondary education, educational leadership, school counseling, library media, instructional technologies, higher education student personnel administration, and other related professional fields. Our results are impressive with UCA graduates scoring above the state and\/or national averages on all important indicators of candidate success. The University of Central Arkansas\u2019 College of Education provides a broad range of graduate programs. Those programs range from Master of Arts in Teaching degree for students seeking initial licensure, degrees for students wishing to change career paths, a degree in College Student Personnel Administration, and a PhD program in Change Leadership for Equity and Inclusion. Many of our programs are online, but maintain small class sizes. Small class size allows students to interact one-on-one with our professors which creates an individualized experience with a higher level of personalization. A majority of our professors hold a doctorate and create their own online course content which means none of our courses are taught by graduate assistants. UCA professors are actively engaged in research which informs their teaching and better prepares you for the workforce. If you are seeking an online, personalized, professional graduate program, then the UCA College of Education programs are for you. UCA dedicates itself to academic vitality, integrity, and diversity.
