More than 50 years and quite a few buildings later, USA is a vibrant university that continues to serve as a catalyst for transformational change in the city, the state and the Gulf Coast region. USA's story began in the early 1960s, when Mobile\u2019s civic leaders saw the need to improve access to higher education in southwest Alabama. Realizing the region had outgrown the small extension program that operated out of a building downtown, they formulated plans for a four-year, degree-granting institution. On May 3, 1963, a bill creating a new, independent university successfully passed the Alabama Legislature, and USA was born. Classes began in June 1964 at a new, $1 million building in west Mobile. Initial enrollment totaled 276. The extent of the pent-up demand for education became obvious when the first fall semester began. Enrollment leaped to 928 \u2014 and it continues to grow. Today, USA enrolls more than 14,000 students annually and has awarded more than 90,000 degrees. The first campus building is now named the Frederick Palmer Whiddon Administration Building, after USA\u2019s first president. Whiddon helped establish the University and remained at its helm until retiring in 1998. His successor, longtime faculty member and administrator V. Gordon Moulton, oversaw a new era of growth into the 21st Century. Dr. Tony G. Waldrop, selected in 2014 as the University\u2019s third president, continues the USA tradition of visionary leadership focused on discovery, health and learning. As new programs attracted more students, the University\u2019s footprint and facilities expanded. Almost from the moment USA accepted its first students, its leaders began ambitiously working toward establishing a medical school. The College of Medicine charter class began in 1973, and USA\u2019s focus on health education was later complemented by the College of Nursing and the Pat Capps Covey College of Allied Health Professions. Today, USA provides high-quality education in business, the liberal arts, education, engineering, computing, the sciences and healthcare. It offers more than 100 undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs through its 10 colleges and schools. The University campus includes USA Technology & Research Park, an incubator of economic development and technological innovation. On the east side of Mobile Bay, USA\u2019s Baldwin County Campus provides eastern shore residents convenient access to educational programs. The University of South Alabama encompasses a comprehensive health system composed of two hospitals \u2014 USA University Hospital and USA Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Hospital \u2014 along with the USA Mitchell Cancer Institute and the USA Physicians Group. This combination of advanced healthcare services has improved the lives of countless residents throughout the entire region. A charter member of the Sun Belt Conference, USA fields 17 Division I sports teams, including baseball, softball, basketball, soccer, volleyball and tennis. The Jaguars football program, established in 2009, played in its first bowl game, the Raycom Media Camellia Bowl, in 2014.
