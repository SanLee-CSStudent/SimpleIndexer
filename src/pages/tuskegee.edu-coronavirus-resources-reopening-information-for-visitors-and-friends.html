Reopening Information for Visitors and Friends Tuskegee University continues to monitor conditions surrounding the pandemic, the spread of the omicron variant, and the pandemic's effects on the reopening of classes for the spring term. --- PLEASE SEE LINKS TO THE LATEST UPDATES --- Reopening Information for Visitors and Friends Each member of the TU community, including visitors, play a critical role in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. Our success depends on every person adhering to the best practices including wearing masks and other protective equipment, practicing physical distancing, washing hands frequently, and so on. Therefore, all visitors to campus, including media personnel, third-party vendors or contractors without a Tuskegee University email, will need to download the TU Checkpoint and COVID-19 Health Check form and respond to the necessary questions to gain entry to the campus. All visitors must have an employee that they are visiting and the name of the building(s) they will be entering while on campus. The TU Checkpoint must be completed at least 24 hours in advance and the scheduled visit must be confirmed by the employee prior to your arrival or entry to campus will be denied. The employee anticipating the arrival of the invited guest(s), should send a message to Public Safety at pmardis@tuskegee.edu notifying them of the invitation which will confirm their guest\u2019s entrance to campus. Please submit all requests for media interviews to: kmcgough@tuskegee.edu. All visitors must complete this form to enter the Lincoln Gate, Logan Hall Gate and Vet School entrance in order to receive a temporary parking pass for the scheduled visit. A temperature screening will be conducted upon arrival. A state issued ID and face mask are required to enter campus. Each visitor is required to complete a separate TU Checkpoint and COVID-19 Health check form. The policies and procedures outlined in the COVID-19 Policies and Procedures are necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure meeting our collective safety and health goals. As such, each member of the TU community has a critical role to play in the fight against the spread of the virus. Our success depends on every person adhering to the best practices as outlined, including wearing masks and other protective equipment, practicing physical distancing, washing hands frequently, and so on. As everyone is expected to take responsibility for their own health, we also expect you to be considerate of the safety of others -- together we can succeed in keeping everyone safe and healthy.
