Pete's Pantry Pete's Pantry is a free supplemental food pantry for currently enrolled Northark students. A division of Northark HELP, Pete's Pantry was designed to assist students with food needs while working to further their education. The only requirement to use the pantry is that the student must be currently enrolled in classes. Students are welcome to visit the pantry twice a month during semesters in which they are enrolled. Pete's Pantry is set up on a point system. The number of people in a student's household will determine the point total for the visit. Students will be allowed to shop through the pantry and select the food for their family. Pete's Pantry is located in room M171 on the South campus of North Arkansas College. The Pantry is open Mondays 11 a.m. - 4 p.m. and Thursdays 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. or by appointment.

You may come by the pantry to shop for your selections, or request a shopping list be sent to you, so that you can pre-order. Pete's Pantry was established through the Working Student Success Network and is sustained through private donations. Through our partnership with the Food Bank of North Central Arkansas, Pete's Pantry is able to receive food on average at 10 cents per pound. While we do accept non-expired shelf life food, we ask that if you wish to donate to the pantry please make a monetary donation.
