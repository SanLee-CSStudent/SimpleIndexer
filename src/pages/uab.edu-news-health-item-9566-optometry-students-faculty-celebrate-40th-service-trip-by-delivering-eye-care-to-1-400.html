Courtesy of Office of the Mayor of Panam? CityThis May, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry Student Volunteers completed a service trip to Panama, making it the 40th consecutive year students from the Optometric Service to Humanity organization have provided much-needed eye care to underserved areas through a trip abroad. The UAB SVOSH trip team \u2014 including 11 students, three doctors and two School of Optometry clinical staff \u2014 provided comprehensive eye exams to 500 Panamanian people in four days. The group also gave out more than 1,200 pairs of eyeglasses and made almost 80 referrals for a variety of ocular disease conditions. SVOSH\u2019s delegation was supported by the local Canal de Panama Kiwanis chapter and the local Lion\u2019s Club. The three not-for-profit service organizations teamed up to deliver an invaluable service to Panama\u2019s most vulnerable while enabling UAB\u2019s SVOSH chapter to have a global service experience. \u201CI think the most rewarding part of the experience for me personally is just realizing how much of an impact we are able to make with something as simple as a pair of glasses in places that may not have access to the level of health care we are used to in the United States,\u201D said Paul Brown, president of UAB SVOSH. \u201COptometry can be a very gratifying profession, but I think there is no better feeling than learning how appreciative the people we see on our international trips are of our services.\u201D For the past 40 years, UAB SVOSH volunteers made up of students, faculty and staff have provided free, comprehensive eye care and eyeglasses to underserved populations, both domestic and international, enriching the lives of student clinicians and the patients they serve. For the past 40 years, UAB SVOSH volunteers made up of students, faculty and staff have provided free, comprehensive eye care and eyeglasses to underserved populations, both domestic and international, enriching the lives of student clinicians and the patients they serve. Past service trips have included Belize, Nicaragua, Peru, Colombia, Honduras and Jamaica, among others, and served thousands of men, women and children globally. The appeal of SVOSH trips ranges from the opportunity to practice on patients who otherwise may never receive adequate eye care, to experiencing travel and immediately experiencing how their clinical skill sets transcend language and culture to impact a person\u2019s life. \u201CThe benefits of these service trips are endless,\u201D said Margaret Bailey, O.D., assistant clinical professor in the School of Optometry and faculty member on the recent Panama trip. \u201CStudents get to practice their skills on high volumes of patients, see pathology they might never see again, and experience \u2014 perhaps for the first time \u2013 providing health care firsthand to those in need, all while staff and faculty are challenged with a novel teaching experience. Everyone involved pays it forward and has the privilege and satisfaction of knowing their \u2018service tree\u2019 has sprouted innumerable branches.\u201D For UAB School of Optometry optician Michele Self, attending 18 SVOSH trips is a testament to the power of these experiences and the passion that those involved have. \u201CI am inspired by the joy of helping people see and taking eye care to those who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have the opportunity to receive it,\u201D Self said. \u201CMost of all, I enjoy seeing our optometry students find their giving heart and the confidence they gain by seeing 500-plus patients in just a few days.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
