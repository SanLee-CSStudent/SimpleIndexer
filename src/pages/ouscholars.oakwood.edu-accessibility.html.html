We work continually to improve the accessibility and usability of Digital Commons, informed by web accessibility standards. Accessibility is an ideal and responsibility that we share with our scholarly community. We collaborate with the administrators at OUScholars to make this website and its contents as accessible as possible. Standards Conformance bepress endeavors to meet all guidelines and standards established by the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at level AA conformance, and Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act. These guidelines define how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities, and conformance to them improves the web's usability for all people. Digital Commons is partially compliant with WCAG 2.1 at level AA, and we make continual improvements with the aim of achieving full compliance. In certain areas, Digital Commons implements level AAA success criteria. For a detailed review of how Digital Commons conforms with WCAG 2.1 success criteria, please refer to our Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) document. This document was produced by the members of the Elsevier and bepress internal accessibility teams.

Accessibility Features Portable Document Format (PDF) Files Digital Commons records may include PDF files as downloadable primary full texts or supplementary content. OUScholars may choose to make tagged PDFs available for users of assistive technology. Document processing within Digital Commons preserves the tag structure of uploaded PDF files. Primary files may have a standard Digital Commons cover page (which contains appropriate tags) prepended to the document. OUScholars may choose to make PDFs with searchable text or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) available. Structural Markup Main navigation links are consistent across pages in OUScholars. Site structure is standardized, as all pages comprise 4 sections: A header bar that includes the main navigation A main content area A sidebar A footer When Cascading Styles Sheets (CSS) are disabled, or when using assistive technology, the 4 sections are read in the above order. Most content and features are operable using only the keyboard. Most of the content of static pages can be accessed with JavaScript disabled in the web browser. Skip Navigation Link Keyboard users may bypass repetitive elements at the top of each page by immediately tabbing to the first interactive item, which is a \u201CSkip to Main Content\u201D link. This allows users to jump to the main section of the current page context. Visual Design and Mobile Display All pages and content may be enlarged using standard browser controls or screen magnification software. A mobile-specific style sheet, with a smaller viewport, is applied for users loading pages on mobile devices. Pages are mostly usable when style sheets are disabled. Text has sufficient contrast (4.5:1 for small text; 3:1 for large text) with its corresponding background to be clearly legible in almost all areas of the site. Links are visually distinguished from text, and most interactive elements also have obvious visual hover and focus states. Access Keys Access keys allow users to jump to specific elements of a web page using keyboard shortcuts. To activate an access key, press the modifier key + the access key. Access key modifiers differ between the web browsers and operating system platforms: Chrome: Alt on Windows. Ctrl + ? Opt on Mac. Firefox: Alt + ? Shift on Windows. Ctrl + ? Opt on Mac.
