Learn more by visiting with your admissions or academic advisor. FAQS What is the UAFS Promise? The UAFS Promise is a fixed tuition program for first-time entering students. Through this program these students are guaranteed a single tuition rate for a maximum of four years of attendance, provided they remain on track to graduate according to their degree plan and maintain eligibility to enroll at UAFS. What does \"on track to graduate\" mean? You are \"on track to graduate\" when you meet the requirements of the degree plan of your chosen bachelor's or associate degree. Most bachelor's degrees require four years of coursework to graduate, and, though there are exceptions, most associate degrees require two years of coursework. You must remain on track to graduate within the designated time frame of your degree plan based on your starting term. Who is eligible for the UAFS Promise? Only first-time entering students are eligible to enroll in the UAFS Promise. How do I sign up? You can sign up for the UAFS Promise during your initial advising appointment during your MANE Event New Student Orientation. What if I haven't yet decided on a major? Am I still eligible to participate? Yes. Undeclared majors are eligible to apply for the UAFS Promise. You must declare your major before the conclusion of your second primary (Fall or Spring) semester of attendance at UAFS. What if I change my major? If you choose to change your major, you are still eligible for the UAFS Promise if you remain on track to graduate within the designated timeframe of your new degree (i.e. within four years of your cohort term if you are seeking a bachelor's degree). UAFS Promise participants should always consult with their academic advisor before changing majors. If you are moving from an associate to a bachelor's degree, you remain eligible for the UAFS Promise as long as you remain on track for graduation within the designed timeframe. How will concurrent hours affect my eligibility? Credit hours earned during high school that apply toward your degree plan do not negatively affect your timeline. Concurrent credit should be included in your progression toward your degree. The hours do not prorate the number of eligible semesters you have to participate in the UAFS Promise. Are fees included in the UAFS Promise program? No, fees are not included in the UAFS Promise program and are subject to change each year. Will this program affect my scholarship or financial aid? No, your participation in this program does not affect your scholarship or financial aid eligibility. 5210 Grand Avenue | P.O.
