Student Complaint Policy Contact Information for Student Complaint by State Huntingdon College provides a limited selection of academic courses via internet portals. These online offerings are designed to augment the College\u2019s traditional delivery methods for students enrolled in degree programs delivered primarily by traditional pedagogical approaches. The college takes seriously its duty to it students, faculty, staff, and general environment as it relates to the services it provides. Should a situation arise in which a student feels as though the treatment that they have received does not align with the policies and procedures which are conveyed through the Huntingdon College website, the College has implemented both policies and procedures for the student to voice complaints with the assurance that the college will provide documentation and accountability in a timely manner to best resolve a complaint. Complaints are to only be submitted by students of Huntingdon college, and are an opportunity for a student to voice concerns of treatment that is disparate from the rights, privileges, and policies, which are conveyed through College publications. The Provost of the College is responsible for grievances that are academic in nature. The college respects the rights and duties of the faculty to design and implement the elements of their applicable classes within the confines of the institutional restraints. Students cannot appeal grades based on allegations concerning the competence of a faculty member, the fairness of an examination, the difficulty of a course, or other matters of a purely pedagogical nature. A student does maintain the right to appeal a grade that he or she perceives as unwarranted for reasons other than those listed previously, by using the stated procedures located in the College Catalog or website as appropriate. Grievances relating to all non academic related issues, such as student services, should be directed to the Student Grievance Policy. Complaints may reference, but are not limited to issues related to housing, parking , student health and wellness activities, Greek life, and campus security. Complaints regarding financial services and student financial aid are to be sent in writing to the Office of the Senior Vice President and Treasurer. The Offices of the Provost,Dean of Students, and\/or Treasurer make every attempt to evaluate the merits of any and every complaint made by students as prescribed under the provisions of SARA, when it applies to interstate distance education. Administration of these departments avidly pursue to apply an unbiased point of view to dispute resolution while compiling information from any and all mediums that we have access to. These offices should be seen as the last course of action, for disputes that you were not able to amicably resolve between yourself and the supervisor or chair of that department. If in an effort to resolve a grievance, prior to entering this process, you may request the name and contact information for the department chair or supervisor either through the employee or these offices. In an effort to accurately and concisely file a complaint, the student should submit the Student Complaint Form. A record of all complaints and applicable material used to support the final resolution will be filed in the Office of the Senior Vice President for Planning and Administration. It is in the best interest of the student, that all fields in the form be completed. Once completed, the form should be submitted to the general school address, and to the attention of the applicable office for the situation which will preside over the complaint.
