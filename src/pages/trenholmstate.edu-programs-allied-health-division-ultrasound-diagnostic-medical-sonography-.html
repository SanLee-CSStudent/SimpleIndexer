Diagnostic medical sonography is a multi-specialty profession comprised of abdominal sonography, breast sonography, cardiac sonography, musculoskeletal sonography, obstetrics and gynecology sonography, vascular sonography, and other emerging clinical areas. These diverse areas all use ultrasound as a primary technology in their daily work. The diagnostic medical sonographer is an individual who provides patient care services using ultrasound and related diagnostic procedures. The diagnostic medical sonographer must be educationally prepared and clinically competent as a prerequisite to professional practice. Demonstration and maintenance of competency through certification by a nationally recognized sonography credentialing organization is the standard of practice in sonography, and maintenance of certification in all areas of practice is endorsed. The diagnostic medical sonographer functions as a delegated agent of the physician and does not practice independently. Diagnostic medical sonographers are committed to enhanced patient care and continuous quality improvement that increases knowledge and technical competence. Diagnostic medical sonographers use independent, professional and ethical judgment, and critical thinking to safely perform diagnostic sonographic procedures. The diagnostic medical sonographer generally performs the following: Obtains, reviews, and integrates pertinent patient history and supporting clinical data to facilitate optimum diagnostic results; Performs appropriate procedures and records anatomic, pathologic, and\/or physiologic data for interpretation by a physician; Records, analyzes, and processes diagnostic data and other pertinent observations made during the procedure for presentation to the interpreting physician; Exercises discretion and judgment in the performance of sonographic and\/or related diagnostic services; Demonstrates appropriate communication skills with patients and colleagues; Acts in a professional and ethical manner; Facilitates communication and education to elicit patient cooperation and understanding of expectations and responds to questions regarding the sonographic examination.
