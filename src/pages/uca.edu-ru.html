Further, the committee is charged with examining and encouraging ways to involve the campus and the greater Conway community in this effort. In addition to cost savings, the team is encouraged to examine policies and practices to identify ways the campus can be more responsible in terms of environmental responsibility and sustainability. These can range from litter control to LEED certified buildings and beyond.

UCA received a grant that provided no cost design work via the University of Arkansas Design Center in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The area which sits south of Bear Hall incorporates low maintenance plants that filter and absorb runoff water. In addition the plants do this prior to entering designed bio swales that are in this project. This effort helps minimize runoff drainage that eventually carries water and sediment into Lake Conway. The Garden portion of this project was mostly completed by University staff and classes involving the garden are part of the UCA curriculum. k. UCA has committed to, at a minimum, constructing LEED buildings. The first such project was Bear Hall. \u201CLEED\u201D stands for leadership in energy and environmental design and this method of construction focuses on five key areas. Those areas are (1)energy efficiency (2)indoor environmental quality (3)material selection (4) sustainable site development and (5) water savings. The HPER Center addition which is now currently underway will be LEED certified as well. 2.
