Nearly all of Huntingdon\u2019s undergraduate students receive some form of institutional scholarship or grant and federal aid. The pages in this section will inform you about the types and amounts of undergraduate financial aid available from Huntingdon in the form of grants, scholarships, loans, and work-study from federal, state, and institutional sources. You will also find instructions for completing financial aid and scholarship application processes, accepting your financial aid offer, tuition and fee costs, and student payments, billing, and accounts. A quality college education is one of the most important investments you will ever make. In this changing world, graduates need the best preparation possible as they enter their professions.
