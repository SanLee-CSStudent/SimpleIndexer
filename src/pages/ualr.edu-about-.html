What makes UA Little Rock a Metropolitan University? It is more than just where the university is located. A metropolitan university has a diverse student body: students are on average older and diverse in ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic background. Because the makeup of a metropolitan university is different, the mission of such an institution is different as well. Metropolitan universities must educate their students, but they also have to teach them to be effective citizens and capable in their chosen professions. Metropolitan universities also have to reach beyond the borders of the campus. They must serve the needs of the community in which they are located by developing partnerships with public and private enterprises. A metropolitan university is an integral part of its region, shaped by its community even as it works with its community to shape their joint future.
