Contact ACT Prep Sessions Centering Equity Series Centering Equity Conference CAYLI Application Real Heroes Teach UCA Women\u2019s Leadership Network is a network created for women, by women, to support women who are seasoned or aspirant leaders in the home, at work or in the community. The purpose of the network is to provide opportunities for women to connect from various backgrounds in Conway and surrounding areas. This network is an LGBTQ Safe Space Zone and diversity-inclusive brave space. This means that we welcome and respect women across a spectrum of gender identities and sexual orientations. We also value and support members who belong to historically underrepresented and diverse ethnic, racial, religious, linguistic and national backgrounds. The bravery in this network will be guided by the idea of parrhesia. This term, meaning fearless speech, has guided great thinkers and leaders\u2014but it is often misunderstood. Fearless or brave speech does not mean that you are entitled to say anything you want with impunity. Instead, it means that you are willing to be humble, vulnerable, and to take a risk in telling the truths that will challenge one another\u2013and the world\u2013to become better. As a member of this network, you will be asked to pledge mutual respect and honesty. You will engage in personal conversations, and so you must be willing to hold yourself accountable to this principle. ELEVATE. EMPOWER. EMBRACE.
