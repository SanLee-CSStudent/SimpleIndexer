The free sessions, open to all students in targeted courses, are held two or three times each week throughout the semester, and special study sessions are added before exams. More in-depth than tutoring, and led by students who have mastered the subjects, SI sessions integrate what you're learning in class with essential learning strategies. As a result, SI participants usually earn higher grades and withdraw from classes less often than other students.
