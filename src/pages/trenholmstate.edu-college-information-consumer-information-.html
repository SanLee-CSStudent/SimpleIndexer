In 2015, the Alabama Legislature vested oversight of the state\u2019s public two-year institutions of higher education (known as the Alabama Community College System (ACCS)) with the Alabama Community College System Board of Trustees. The Alabama Legislature further directed the Board of Trustees to delegate to the System\u2019s Chancellor the authority to act and make decisions concerning the management and operation of the community and technical colleges. The Chancellor is assisted in these duties by the staff of the System Office, formerly known as the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education. Consumer and student complaints that are not resolved at the institutional level will be arbitrated at the state level by the ACCS System Office. The ACCS is committed to respecting and supporting the work of its member institutions and to providing a quality educational experience for all students. The objective of the student complaint process is to ensure that the concerns and complaints of students are addressed fairly and are resolved promptly. The Alabama Community College System requires each institution to establish its own procedures to address student grievances and complaints. A student must exhaust his\/her rights under the institution\u2019s official complaint\/grievance policy before advancing any complaint to the System Office of Alabama Community College System. The procedures for filing student complaints are outlined on the College\u2019s Website and Students may file consumer\/student complaints with the Alabama Community College System by following these procedures: Student Complaint Procedures Facilities And Services For Students With Disabilities ADA Accommodations Office The Office of Disability Support Services is the central campus resource for students who wish to request academic accommodations.
