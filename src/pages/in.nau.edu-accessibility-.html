Accordion Closed Accessibility generally means that a product or service is available to and usable by as many people as possible. In order to ensure accessibility, it is best to consider the needs of a wide variety of users at the time that we are designing our product or service, since rebuilding it later will take more time, effort, and resources than doing it well from the beginning. Is accessibility just for buildings? Accordion Closed Accessibility applies everywhere! We want all of our environments, whether they are physical or virtual, to be useful to everyone. For example, a course\u2019s design and materials should consider the needs of a variety of people by including captioning on videos, accessible digital content, and a clear organizational structure.
