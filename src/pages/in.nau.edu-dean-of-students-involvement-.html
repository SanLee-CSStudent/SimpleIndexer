It\u2019s the #TrueBlueWay. Being involved on Campus has created friendships and many of my favorite memories as a Lumberjack. It creates community, gives experience, and makes you proud to be a Lumberjack. When I first moved to Flagstaff, I knew no one as an out-of-state student. I found belonging at NAU through events, community council, ASNAU, and clubs. Being involved at NAU has made it the ultimate college experience. \u2013 Brendan Trachsel, Senior Our goal: To have every Lumberjack involved in at least one student organization. We know getting involved helps build lifelong memories and connections while also developing essential skills in students like you. Getting involved at NAU has never been easier, with nearly 400 student organizations seeking to meet you. Whoever you are, we have a place for you.

We have a variety of clubs representing diverse groups and interests across campus. Can\u2019t find the club for you? Start your own. Types of organizations Accordion Closed Academic student organizations comprise the largest number of clubs and organizations on campus. These include any organization that is affiliated with an academic program or college. Advocacy student organizations are those that advocate for a particular cause or population of students. Cultural student organizations represent and promote the traditions and activities associated with a particular culture. Fraternity and Sorority groups are associated with national social Greek-letter fraternities and sororities that select membership through a bid process. Recreation\/Game student organizations focus on recreational activities and games in a noncompetitive atmosphere Religious student organizations may also register with the Office of the Dean of Students. Although the university, as a state institution, is prohibited from promoting religious activities, it recognizes the importance of religion and spirituality in the life and education of its students. Representative student organizations are those elected bodies that represent the general student population. Residence Hall Councils are groups that represent the concerns and interests of a particular residence hall. Service\/Honorary student organizations are academically focused groups that limit membership based on certain requirements of community service oriented groups. Special Interest are not connected to an academic program or college. They serve the needs of students with specific special interests. Sport Club organizations are sports teams or groups engaged in active practice and competition against other schools or individuals. The Office of the Dean of Students collaborates with Campus Recreation Services to support these organizations. Fraternity & Sorority Life Leadership Engagement We\u2019re focused on providing students with the resources and opportunities needed to enhance their educational experience. We help students cultivate the skills needed to become effective leaders in their lives and careers. We create opportunities for students to engage, have fun, and celebrate being a Lumberjack.
