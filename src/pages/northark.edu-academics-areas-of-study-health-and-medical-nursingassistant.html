Faculty Contact Angie Moix CNA\/Medical Assisting Program Director (870) 391-3140 natp.primaryinstructor@northark.edu \"I became interested in the CNA program when my son was born in 2015. We were so well taken care of in the hospital by all of our RNs. I felt like they really just went above and beyond. I started my college journey this fall and in order to become an RN, I must first be a CNA. CNAs do much more than what people generally assume. In the future I hope to continue and get my BSN. My dream job would be working in the ICU or NICU.\" - Margret Thibodeaux, CNA student Learning Outcomes Promote a good understanding of ethics with emphasis on the need for confidentiality.

Licensure and Certification Upon completion of Northark\u2019s Nurse Aide Training Program, students will meet the requirements to test for certification as a Nursing Assistant in the state of Arkansas. There is both a written and a clinical component to the Arkansas state test and once both are successfully completed, the nurse aide becomes certified. We are unsure of certification requirements in other states as the nurse aide scope of practice varies from state to state. There are reciprocal agreements between states, the student would be responsible for ascertaining this information. State Testing and Recertification Sponsorships through a long-term facility or grant entity often include state testing fees. In all other cases, students are responsible for their states testing fees. Testing fees are determined by Headmasters TMU and are currently $125\/student and cover both the written and skills tests. Testing fees are subject to change. All CNA testing in the state of Arkansas is currently administered by TMU Headmasters and includes both a written and a skills test. North Arkansas College serves as a testing site exclusive to students who graduate from our program. Testing must be scheduled by the individual student by creating and logging into their personal account at: https:\/\/ar.tmuniverse.com\/ and choosing a testing location and time. Students are not required to test at the facility where they received their instruction but often choose to do so due to lab familiarity. You may reach Headmasters TMU toll free at #888-401-0465 for any questions regarding testing including scheduling, available testing dates and payment issues. Recertification: All current CNAs looking to renew their certification or students who have been previously certified and let their certification lapse, must contact TMU Headmasters at #888-401-0465. North Arkansas College has no role in recertification as these guidelines are determined by the Arkansas Office of Long-Term Care and\/or their designee.
