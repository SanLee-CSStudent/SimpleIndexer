Points of Pride The new 53,843-square-foot Workforce Training Center officially opened in April 2018. The state-of-the-art facility offers training in the high-wage, high-demand occupations of HVAC, automotive service technology, industrial mechanics & maintenance, and welding. The building also features a 5,000-square-foot space for customized workforce training classes for both new and existing industries. The Workforce Training Center was made possible by combining an EDA grant with a bond issue, along with almost $3 million in private funds donated by individuals, businesses and industry. The technical programs have over 170 advisory members representing more than 150 companies. UACCM technical students won three gold, three silver, and three bronze medals in the 2018 Arkansas State SkillsUSA competition. UACCM has invested significant funding in recent years for security enhancements on campus, including security cameras in buildings and across parking lots, an emergency alert system, including digital signage throughout buildings and campus, and improved lighting across campus. UACCM, in collaboration with area public and private secondary schools, has a Technical Pathways concurrent enrollment policy, allowing high school students to enroll in college technical courses and attend UACCM full-time. High school students may complete UACCM certificates of proficiency, technical certificates and associate of applied science degrees, while meeting high school graduation requirements. The UACCM High School\/Home School Concurrent Program offers an opportunity for advanced or gifted high school and home school students to enroll in college courses that enhance or complement their studies. UACCM operates four Adult Education Centers in Morrilton, Perryville, Conway, and Clinton.
