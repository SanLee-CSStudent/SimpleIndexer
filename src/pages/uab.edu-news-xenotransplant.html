Read the full story Media resources for journalists On this page: News Photos About the process UAB media contacts Stories about the project Xenotransplant is defined as transplanting an animal organ or product into a human to cure disease. Utilizing genetically modified pig kidneys could provide an increased supply for those needing a kidney transplant. Why do we need xenotransplantation? \u201CWe have this amazing therapy called kidney transplantation that works 95 to 98 percent of the time, and yet there are only about 25,000 kidneys to go around in the U.S. every year, but we have 800,000 people who need them. The hardest part is seeing patients in clinic and wait-listing them knowing they might actually die before I ever get an organ-offer to transplant them. So the opportunity to have an organ that is waiting there for the person who needs it is just overwhelming to think about. I feel very privileged to be just a tiny part of a really big puzzle that people have been working on for many years.\u201D - Dr. Jayme Locke, Director, Division of Transplantation, Heersink School of Medicine Read more about UAB\u2019s breakthrough Pig kidneys to humans: next steps for the UAB xenotransplantation program UAB physicians are working on the next steps to begin compassionate or emergency use of the pig kidneys in living humans.

Pointing the way forward: This study was conducted to meet the same standards as a Phase I clinical trial, making it mirror \u2014 as much as possible \u2014 every step of a normal transplant between humans. First peer-reviewed, published study on a clinical-grade genetically modified pig kidney xenotransplant in a human, in which native kidneys were removed from the human recipient and pig kidneys were transplanted inside the body. Prior to surgery, the team validated a UAB-developed compatibility test to determine that the genetically modified pig kidney was a good tissue match for the human recipient. The pig kidneys were placed in the same anatomic locations used for human donor kidneys, with the same attachments to the renal artery, renal vein and to the ureter that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder.
