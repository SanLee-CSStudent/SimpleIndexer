UAB\u2019s Pre-Law Program making an impact outside of the classroom Students who participate in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Pre-Law Program in the Department of Criminal Justice have access to pre-law advising, an academic minor, and activities designed to build pre-professional competencies, including legal research and critical thinking. Students who participate in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Pre-Law Program in the Department of Criminal Justice have access to pre-law advising, an academic minor, and activities designed to build pre-professional competencies, including legal research and critical thinking. UAB\u2019s Pre-Law Program partnered with Redemption Earned, Inc. for the new Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) Pre-Law Student Initiative. Clockwise from top left: Brandon Blankenship, Paul Littlejohn, Martha Earwood, Darrius Culpepper, Shae Thomas, Sue Bell Cobb.According to Brandon Blankenship, J.D., assistant professor in the Department of Criminal Justice and director of the Pre-Law Program, these skills\u2014along with many others\u2014consistently prove to be valuable when practicing law or working in careers in law. In addition to the core competencies, Blankenship also emphasizes community engagement and restorative leadership with his pre-law students. \u201C[We\u2019re] proactively building community,\u201D said Blankenship. Engaging Students For Blankenship, community-building often begins with engaging middle and high school students in hands-on learning experiences. One of the longest-standing experiences available through the Pre-Law Program is Journey to Attorney, an innovative summer camp for rising high school juniors and seniors that includes mock mediation and mock trials. During the camp, UAB pre-law students support camp participants as they retry a historic case (the last camp focused on the Scottsboro Nine case). Attendees dig into the facts of the case and aim to achieve a just result\u2014an effort that often requires 12-hour days and intensive preparation. As the students retry the case, they also examine ways in which they can restore justice in the community. The experience builds knowledge, relationships, and empathy, and, often, inspires participants to become life-long learners. Although the camp will not take place in Summer 2022, it will reemerge in Summer 2023. Along with engaging high school students in hands-on summer learning experiences, Blankenship and his team also find opportunities to reach students in classrooms. Megan Edwards, an AmeriCorps VISTA with the program, recently helped coordinate and facilitate a digital learning experience for middle school students in Shelby County for Law Day 2022. The American Bar Association (ABA) annually sponsors Law Day on May 1. According to the ABA, the program aims to celebrate the role of law in our society and to cultivate a deeper understanding of the legal profession. To support the mission of Law Day 2022, Edwards recruited judges and district attorneys from across the state of Alabama to record engaging video presentations for Shelby County students based on the following theme: \u201CToward a More Perfect Union: The Constitution in Times of Change.\u201D Edwards also made the videos available to the Alabama State Bar, so the organization could share the content with schools outside of Shelby County. According to Blankenship, Judge Bill Bostick\u2014the presiding judge on the Circuit 18 court in Shelby County\u2014delivered one of the most compelling video presentations. Bostick shared insights with the students and also gave them a virtual tour of his courtroom. For Blankenship, this kind of exposure to the legal profession is a driving force behind the community engagement work of the pre-law program. And, based on the feedback he received from one of the teachers who shared the video presentation with her class, it\u2019s working. \"My 7th and 8th grade students thoroughly enjoyed the Law Day 2022 experience. The program was well produced and offered such a variety of speakers,\u201D said Julie P. Kennedy, social studies teacher at Oak Mountain Middle School. \u201CIt was intriguing to hear from our county and state judges, attorneys, and state representative and the impact they have on the lives of our community. Hopefully, their words inspired my students to give back to their communities when they are older.\" JEDI Students at Oak Mountain Middle School participated in Law Day 2022.

In the case of the newly-established Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) Pre-Law Student Initiative, UAB students get the opportunity to develop competencies that will help them in law school, while also supporting community organizations and attorneys that have limited resources and staff. Blankenship developed the service-learning program in partnership with Brandon Wolfe, former Assistant Vice President for Campus and Community Engagement in UAB\u2019s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The program is now managed by an undergraduate student, Parth Sharma, who is majoring in criminal justice and mathematics and serving a Fellowship in Restorative Justice and Leadership. The fellowship was made possible by the LifeCrafter Foundation, a strategic partner of the Pre-Law program that provides substantial support in the form of scholarships and AmeriCorps VISTAs. This past academic year, the JEDI program created an opportunity for Eshandae (\u201CShae\u201D) Thomas\u2014a pre-law student who is majoring in criminal justice and minoring in legal affairs\u2014to work alongside Redemption Earned, Inc., a nonprofit organization that identifies, assists, and represents incarcerated individuals worthy of parole or work release. Sue Bell Cobb, former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, serves as the executive director of Redemption Earned, Inc. and sought out meaningful opportunities for Thomas to support the organization\u2019s work. \u201CAll of us were so excited when Professors Brandon Blankenship and Martha Earwood informed us that Redemption Earned, Inc. would be given the opportunity to work with a UAB pre-law intern,\u201D said Cobb. \u201CShae Thomas was simply extraordinary and completely dedicated to our efforts to assist worthy \u2018aged and infirmed\u2019 incarcerated individuals with gaining parole. Shae helped us synthesize and manage reams of data from the Alabama Department of Corrections. She provided valuable insight as we developed processes to be able to chart a new path to fill this huge gap in the criminal justice system. Her help was invaluable.\u201D Thomas conducted research and developed a system to identify potential clients for Redemption Earned, Inc. Along the way, Thomas also received mentorship and guidance from Darrius Culpepper, a law fellow at Redemption Earned, Inc., and Paul Littlejohn, a subject matter expert who experienced incarceration for 35 years. \u201CMy time with Redemption Earned has shown me how time can change people,\u201D said Thomas. \u201CIt's something we hear all the time, but I got to experience it firsthand.\u201D That experience led her to present at UAB\u2019s Service Learning and Undergraduate Research Expo. Thomas created a poster highlighting her research and work with Redemption Earned, Inc., and she went on to win first place in the Social and Behavioral Sciences for Online Poster Presentations. Moving Forward As Blankenship reflects on Thomas\u2019 research and accomplishments, he acknowledges the value of students \u201Cbuilding a body of work\u201D and doing work that energizes them. Now, Blankenship\u2019s vision for experiential learning has uncovered a new priority for future community engagement efforts within the program. Moving forward, Blankenship and his team plan to focus their attention on ensuring that students in Alabama are reading on grade-level by the fourth grade. At first, some may wonder how literacy fits into the community work of the Pre-Law Program\u2014for Blankenship, the answer is clear. \u201CI see pre-law as cradle to grave. I really think our pre-law journey, as far as UAB\u2019s concerned, really starts with elementary-level reading,\u201D said Blankenship. \u201CIf our [pre-law] students can participate in helping students be on grade-level with their reading by fourth grade, then those fourth graders have an opportunity to one day practice law\u2026 if that\u2019s what they want to do.\u201D And, perhaps, that is the overarching goal of the UAB Pre-Law program. Connecting students of all ages with learning experiences and community partners to ensure anyone who wishes to pursue a career in law can do so. Thankfully, the program is getting closer to achieving that goal each day. Read more...

Kacey Keith pursuing justice and peace in her career Kacey Keith often encounters conflict when addressing structural and cultural harm through her work as a consultant, and she has an appreciation for people who are willing and prepared to face disputes head-on. Photo courtesy of Kacey KeithKacey Keith often encounters conflict when addressing structural and cultural harm through her work as a consultant with Honeycomb Justice Consulting. Given her personal, academic, and professional experiences growing up in the South, she has an appreciation for people who are willing and prepared to face disputes head-on. \u201CI don\u2019t think I would understand [how] to approach conflict in a straight-forward way if it wasn\u2019t for being from Alabama,\u201D said Keith. \u201CConflict lives in unison with peace\u2014so, how do we handle conflict with peaceful solutions?\u201D During her early years in Birmingham, Keith developed a deep connection to the city\u2019s civil and human rights history. At the same time, she wanted to learn more about cultures outside of her hometown. This interest prompted her to consider colleges that offered dynamic international studies programs, eventually leading her to the University of Alabama at Birmingham. She enrolled at UAB in 2012 and sought out an array of classes to complement her international studies major. That curiosity steered her to a peace studies course which exposed her to peace on a global scale. The experience inspired her to continue seeking out peace studies courses at UAB, and, eventually, she enrolled in a class with Douglas Fry, Ph.D., former chair of the Department of Anthropology. Fry\u2019s teaching had a profound impact on Keith, influencing her future academic and career pathways. \u201CI was hooked,\u201D said Keith. \u201CIt was very much in alignment with my world view\u2026 So, I applied to the Anthropology of Peace and Human Rights graduate program [at UAB].\u201D The Anthropology of Peace and Human Rights (APHR) program is a two-year master\u2019s program focusing on peace as behavioral process at multiple levels including at the level of individuals, families, groups, communities, cultures, and nations. Soon after starting the program, Keith met another influential faculty member in the Department of Anthropology: Peter Verbeek, Ph.D. Keith took several of Verbeek\u2019s classes, and, throughout those experiences, she learned that peace ethology is a measurable science with actionable steps. \u201CI loved the courses,\u201D said Keith. \u201CThey were very influential\u2014specifically in understanding what it takes to make a culture shift for the understanding of peace.\u201D Verbeek\u2019s mentorship and scholarly work proved to be valuable to Keith as she concluded her graduate studies and transitioned into her career. Soon after completing the APHR program, Keith started working for the City of Birmingham and was immediately given an opportunity to apply her knowledge of peace and human rights. \u201CI was an intern with [Mayor Randall Woodfin\u2019s] social justice transition team,\u201D said Keith. \u201CI helped develop the Office of Peace and Policy and supported the creation of a peace plan for the City of Birmingham.\u201D During her time with the city, Keith formed an enduring bond with a co-worker, Jasmyn Story. Together, Keith and Story began working on nonviolence, restorative justice, and reentry-focused programs for Birmingham. Keith connected with the strategic planning side of the work, while Story served as an effective practitioner. For Keith, it was powerful to further apply the knowledge and skills she attained through the APHR program. \u201CI\u2019m interested in the neurobiology of empathy,\u201D said Keith. \u201CUnderstanding that empathy is one of the most powerful tools for peace is what led me to restorative justice.\u201D Keith\u2019s interest in restorative justice continued to grow, as did her collaborative relationship with Story. Eventually, they both transitioned into roles with Honeycomb Justice Consulting, a collective of consultants that helps institutions and companies implement restorative justice practices and navigate instances of harm. Honeycomb also supports its clients with strategic planning and training. Keith\u2014who now lives in Denver, Colorado\u2014serves as a core team member for the consultancy and continues to work alongside Story, her long-time collaborator and mentor. As she helps expand the impact of Honeycomb across the country, she looks back on her time at UAB and Birmingham fondly. \u201CI\u2019m grateful for UAB, and I\u2019m grateful for [its] international focus,\u201D said Keith. \u201CThe wisdom that came from the professors plus the legacy of the city, together, really created the space for the learning that I needed to be able to root myself in this work.\u201D Verbeek celebrates Keith\u2019s accomplishments and believes her work will have a lasting impact. \"During her time in the APHR program, Kacey was both a scholar and practitioner of peace. Her work and insights have benefited APHR as well as our Birmingham community,\u201D said Verbeek. \u201CWe will follow Kacey\u2019s career on peace with great interest in the knowledge that she will excel at it.\u201D Read more...

Center for Nanoscale Materials and Biointegration partners in $20 million statewide effort funded by NSF Nine Alabama universities and one private firm are partnered in a new $20 million, five-year effort to develop transformative technologies in plasma science and engineering. Yogesh Vohra, Ph.D., working with physics graduate student Chris Perreault.Nine Alabama universities and one private firm are partnered in a new $20 million, five-year effort led by the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) to develop transformative technologies in plasma science and engineering (PSE) funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The grant is entitled \u201CFuture Technologies enabled by Plasma Processes\u201D (FTPP) and will be for a five-year duration (2022-2027) to explore plasma synthesized novel materials, surface modified biomaterials, food safety and sterilization, and space weather prediction. Yogesh Vohra, Ph.D., associate dean for University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s (UAB) College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) and professor university scholar in the Department of Physics, serves as a co-principal investigator and UAB\u2019s Institutional lead for this statewide award. The UAB research team, led by Vohra, includes the following members from the UAB Center for Nanoscale Materials and Biointegration (CNMB), which is based in CAS: Paul Baker, Ph.D. Renato Camata, Ph.D. Aaron Catledge, Ph.D. Cheng-Chien Chen, Ph.D. Wenli Bi, Ph.D. Vinoy Thomas, Ph.D. Scott Snyder, Ph.D., professor in the UAB School of Education, will provide internal evaluation for this grant and will monitor management, statewide workforce issues, and internal projects. The grant will support two postdoctoral research scholars at UAB\u2014along with several graduate students\u2014who will work synergistically with other academic institutions and an industrial partner in this consortium. In addition, the grant offers the opportunity for faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars to take the laboratory-based pilot synthesis of novel materials to their full commercial potential. \u201CThe funding is the result of a team effort from the co-investigators in assembling the group, who generated the concepts and ideas underlying the proposal and executed the plan by writing a successful proposal,\u201D said Gary Zank, Ph.D., FTPP\u2019s principal investigator, director of UAH\u2019s Center for Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research (CSPAR) and the Aerojet Rocketdyne chair of the Department of Space Science. Although different in aims, research goals, and scope from a previous $20 million NSF EPSCoR grant awarded in 2017, the new FTPP grant will continue to build plasma expertise, research, and industrial capacity, as well as a highly trained and capable plasma science and engineering workforce, across Alabama. Yogesh Vohra. \u201CPlasma is the most abundant form of matter in the observable universe. PSE is a technological and scientific success story, translating advances in fundamental plasma science to technologies that address society\u2019s needs,\u201D said Vohra. \u201CUAB\u2019s role in this consortium is to develop future transformational technologies enabled by PSE including data-driven approaches in plasma synthesized high-entropy and quantum materials.\u201D According to Vohra, the research team will employ machine learning techniques to speed up the process for materials discovery and guide the materials synthesis effort using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition and plasmas generated by high-powered lasers. The plasma synthesized materials will be especially designed for their applicability in extreme environments, including elevated temperatures as well as thin-film superconductors which can be used in quantum information devices. An additional effort is devoted to plasma assisted metal nanoparticle deposition for their antimicrobial properties to be employed in biomedical devices for reduction in infection rates. Partnered with UAH and UAB are the University of Alabama (lead: Dr. R. Branam), Auburn University (lead: Dr. E. Thomas), Tuskegee University (lead: Dr. V. Rangari), the University of South Alabama (lead: Dr. E. Spencer), Alabama A&M University (lead: Dr. R. Mentreddy), Alabama State University (lead: Dr. K. Vig), and Oakwood University (lead: Dr. A. Volkov), together with a commercial\/industrial partner CFD Research Corporation (lead: Dr. V. Kolobov), that specializes in computational fluid dynamics software and is located in Cummings Research Park. In addition, FTPP cooperatively partners with three national laboratories: Los Alamos National Lab, Sandia National Lab, and Princeton Plasma Physics Lab. FTPP will harness and share cooperatively the project team\u2019s collective expertise, resources, and workforce. \u201CNot only are the problems to be investigated in the FTPP program among the most challenging intellectually, they have enormous societal benefits and commercial implications,\u201D said Zank.

Welcoming Dr. Ellen Mwenesongole to UAB Ellen Mwenesongole, Ph.D., associate professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice, moved to Birmingham in January 2022. Ellen Mwenesongole, Ph.D.,Ellen Mwenesongole, Ph.D. associate professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice, moved to Birmingham in January 2022. Prior to coming to UAB, Mwenesongole studied and worked at universities in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Botswana. Burel Goodin, Ph.D., associate professor in UAB\u2019s Department of Psychology, wanted to learn more about Mwenesongole\u2019s journey to UAB and her scholarly work, so he recently conducted a digital interview with her. Below is an edited summary of their conversation. Goodin: What brings you to UAB and how has the transition been? Mwenesongole: I chose to come to UAB due to its reputation as a research-intensive university and because it has one of the few accredited master\u2019s in forensic science degree programs in the U.S. The opportunities offered to faculty for career development, research, and teaching also attracted me to UAB, as did its genuine approach and effort towards diversity, equity, and inclusion. After being appointed by UAB, I initially started teaching online while based in Botswana, which was not easy with the time difference. Now, it is so much better being in the same country while teaching. It\u2019s been a few months since I arrived in Birmingham, so I\u2019m still in the transition period, but I realize that there are more similarities than differences from previous universities I\u2019ve worked at. Goodin: You seem to have a varied education and work experience, tell us more about that. Mwenesongole: My venture into further education actually started at Procter & Gamble in South Africa where I worked as a senior scientist after obtaining my bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry. I wanted to be part of the research and development team, but, at that time, most of my workmates in that section had master\u2019s or Ph.D. degrees. Therefore, I took time out to get a master\u2019s degree with the intention of returning to the corporate world as a research and development scientist. I guess the study-bug bit, and I ended up with chemistry and forensic science master\u2019s degrees from University of Pretoria and University of Strathclyde, respectively, and a Ph.D. in Forensic Science from Anglia Ruskin University. I interspaced my studies with working at a pharmaceutical company in Scotland and a doping control laboratory in South Africa before venturing into academia to lead the development of forensic science programs at universities in South Africa and Botswana. Goodin: How did you end up in forensic science? Mwenesongole: My interest in science was ignited when I was in junior high school\u2014from that point forward, I knew I\u2019d end up as some sort of scientist. Also, my interest in mystery crime novels and movies fuelled my passion to contribute to using science to aid in investigating criminal incidents. Goodin: What are your current research interests? Mwenesongole: My key focus area of research is in analyzing drugs of abuse (illicit and pharmaceutical) from different matrices such as blood, urine, and wastewater. Analysis of wastewater provides a quick snapshot of what drugs a particular community is using and can help with developing appropriate intervention measures from a law enforcement, health, or education perspective. It\u2019s research that I have conducted in the U.K. and Botswana and plan to continue in the U.S. In recent years, I\u2019ve also been involved in the chemical profiling of illicit drugs for intelligence purposes. Goodin: What is your thought on collaborations\u2014are you open to collaborations? Mwenesongole: Once you realize that no one person, department, university, organization, or other entity holds the key to solving any problem, you start appreciating that answers to problems can come about much quicker when you collaborate with others. I\u2019ve collaborated with universities in the U.K., Botswana, and South Africa and hope to extend that into U.S. universities as well as other departments at UAB. The most effective collaborations are those in which every team member\u2019s voice is heard and their competence and experience in a particular area is harnessed for the good of the overall research project. Collaborations that fizzle out within a short time are those where a few team members think they know best and impose ideas onto others rather than incorporating various ideas and ways of doing things to arrive at the best outcome. Goodin: What would you like to see changed or improved in your area of teaching or research? Mwenesongole: Forensic science still has many unchartered areas of research both on a local and global scale. I\u2019d like to see more collaboration with various departments\u2014such as engineering and the legal department\u2014to develop relevant and unique products that can be used in teaching and research. More work also needs to be done to collaborate with relevant stakeholders, including various law enforcement agencies and forensic labs nationally and internationally. Also, we must find opportunities to collaborate with other forensic programs. There is so much one can learn from interacting with a diverse portfolio of collaborators. Goodin: What are your expectations from UAB and what do you hope to achieve? Mwenesongole: My expectations of UAB are tied to what attracted me to the university in the first place. I expect to be given the space to use the opportunities at hand to grow my teaching and research portfolio. We must avoid saying, \u201CWe have always done things this way,\u201D because that mindset can become a hindrance to teaching and research. I look forward to freely contributing to the growth of the department, college, and university. Read more...
