You can order transcripts at any time of the day or week, and SAU will process transcript orders during business hours. Order processing times may vary due to the number of orders received daily. Order an official transcript The Parchment site will provide instructions for placing your order, including delivery options and fees. You can order as many transcripts as you like in a single session. Parchment charges a $3.00 processing fee for each transcript sent, plus an additional postage charge for physical transcripts. Order updates will be emailed to you, and you can also check your order status and history online. If you need assistance or have questions about the Parchment transcript ordering service, please visit the Parchment Help Center website. You may also request your transcript free of charge by visiting the Registrar\u2019s Office in Nelson 102 during business hours and providing a photo ID. If you would prefer not to use the online system but are unable to come to our office, you may also contact us at sauregistrar@saumag.edu or 870-235-4031 to request a transcript request form be sent to you by mail. There will be no cost for this service. Verification of Enrollment Enrollment Verification for current students can be requested via the CampusConnect Student Dashboard under the \u201CForms\u201D tab.
