Frequently Asked Questions: What is UBMS? Upward Bound Math-Science, or UBMS, is a federally funded program at Lyon College that serves first generation, low-income high school students in central and eastern Arkansas. The goal of the program is to provide students with the opportunities, skills, and motivation needed to successfully complete college and beyond - with a focus on STEM majors and careers (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). What is a Tutor-Mentor? A Tutor-Mentor, or TM, is a position we hire to assist us with the summer residential component of our program. Tutor-Mentors work under the supervision of the director, assistant director, and the resident staff supervisor (RSS). The UBMS high school participants come to Lyon for six weeks to experience college life. They take classes during the day, do research with Lyon faculty, and go on cultural and educational trips. Our Tutor-Mentors are just that: Tutors and Mentors. They work closely with students to help them adjust to their new surroundings and be away from home (some for the first time), and facilitate the students gaining the self-esteem and confidence necessary to become successful college students. Tutor-Mentors live on campus with our students and provide support by assisting us in supervising them during all activities - such as, getting around campus to classes, going on trips, tutoring, and generally helping the students adjust to college life. Interaction with their roommates and with program staff is a very important element in helping the students gain self-confidence and skills to be successful college students and facilitating this interaction is a major responsibility of the TM.
