COVID-19 Dashboard and Resource Center COVID-19 Dashboard and Resource Center __________________ The health of the Tuskegee University students, faculty, staff, and alumni as well as the surrounding communities during the COVID-19 pandemic is our primary focus. The charts below illustrate the key metrics for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 on our university campus beginning with the first week of class. This information will become a part of our coronavirus resource page and will be updated weekly to keep you informed of our testing data. As we initiate sentinel testing and continue our cluster testing protocols, the trends that emerge will provide a more detailed understanding of incidence and the epidemiological curve in the on-campus community. Please visit our COVID-19 Dashboard and Resource Center weekly as we provide updates and trend analyses to keep our internal and external stakeholders informed.
