A QEP is a Quality Enhancement Plan. The regional accrediting body, SACS-COC (Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools), requires (Core Requirement 2.12), its member institutions to develop and implement a five-year plan that describes a detailed action plan that addresses a well-defined and focused topic or issue pertaining to the enhancement of student learning outcomes. What is Oakwood University\u2019s QEP topic? The Right to Write: Critical Thinking Development Through Writing How was this topic selected and why? A QEP Topic Selection Committee representative of administration, faculty, staff and students was organized to identify and select a QEP topic. The process of selecting a topic involved a collaboration of stakeholders engaged in interrelated activities and discussions inclusive of the analysis of the following data sources: Independent Consultant Environmental Scan Report Results from the Student Satisfaction Inventory Results from Faculty Surveys A review of the University Strategic Plan for 2010-2015 A review of the University\u2019s mission statement, vision, goals, aim, and motto What is the overall goal of our QEP? To equip OU students with critical thinking skills that will enhance their educational experience How will the QEP improve student learning in the specific area of critical thinking in writing? Students will benefit from the QEP by becoming better writers- more accurate, more precise, and better able to assess their own writing and make the necessary revisions. These skills should serve them well in their upper division courses, as they approach all learning more critically. Who developed the QEP? A QEP Development Committee comprised of select OU administration, faculty, staff and students was formed with the primary task of developing the QEP. The development process was built on campus-wide involvement of relevant constituencies: administration, alumni, board members, faculty, students, staff, and other individuals who were knowledgeable of the subject. When will the QEP begin? The targeted implementation of the QEP begins the Fall Semester 2012. How will the QEP be evaluated? A SACS team of evaluators will visit Oakwood March 26-28, 2012 to provide feedback on the QEP document. Evaluative criteria include: Has the institution demonstrated capability for initiation, implementation, and completion of the QEP? Has the institution demonstrated broad-based involvement of institutional constituencies in the development and proposed implementation of the QEP? Has the institution identified goals and student learning outcomes that are achievable and assessable? Has the institution articulated a plan to assess achievement of goals and student learning outcomes? Has the institution demonstrated financial support for the QEP?
