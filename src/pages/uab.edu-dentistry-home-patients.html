Comprehensive care means we take a long-term approach for helping you achieve the best health for your mouth. Our recently renovated clinic offers the latest for modern delivery of dental care. Supervised by our expert team of faculty, students who are in the process of earning a DMD degree spend significant time evaluating all aspects of your dental and oral health to offer you various treatment options, most often beginning with a cleaning or deep cleaning. Then, they will follow a specified treatment sequence. While being a patient in this student program offers attractive fees, the time required is generally greater than in our other clinics and your student may change over time due to graduation.
