The status comparison shows at 98% from last year, which is after the tuition rate increase and stated we are down some in student semester credit hours. We are 6% down from last year in revenue but we did lower our budget target giving us on budget. Expenses are on target for salary and benefits. As a whole, expenses are always slightly higher at the beginning of the academic year due to start-up costs. Overall, revenue is ahead of previous years and expenses are trending in line with previous years. Salaries are less than 50% at this time and we are trending well. Auxiliary is not as positive, but is still doing well. The discontinued rentals has helped with inventory and when you combine the rental\/sales we are still ahead with this year\u2019s sales. Don mentioned the majority of sales of purchases take place in early to mid-January. Salaries and Operating Expenses are little below at this time of year. The College Store had a net profit gain of 9% last year, but they cannot carry expenses on their own.
