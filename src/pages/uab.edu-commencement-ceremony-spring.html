Our preference is to have a safe, in-person commencement ceremony for your graduating class and we will move forward with making plans for that. At the same time, we will be carefully monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our community while developing a virtual commencement back-up plan. We ask that you try to prepare for both scenarios. While not ideal, it will help your family and friends with travel plans and expectations if they understand that we may have to move to a virtual ceremony should community spread of COVID-19 be too high to safely hold our event in April. If you plan to attend commencement, you must register to walk. If you experience issues with registering, please e-mail This email address is being protected from spambots.
