Field of Interest What does it mean to be human? How can we live well in an ever-changing world? What are the common threads that bind us together? In what ways are our experiences culturally constructed and fundamentally different from others? From ancient to modern times, we have asked penetrating questions about the human condition. Now as then, we use language, philosophy, religion, art, music, performance, and literature to puzzle through these questions, to organize our world, and to negotiate the fundamental aspects of being human. These modes of expression are fundamental to what we call \"the humanities.\" The humanities represent diverse disciplines concerned with human experience, thought, and creativity. In addition to our pathway, all associate degree programs within MCCCD require 3-6 credits of humanities courses. The courses in the humanities deploy rigorous and interdisciplinary lenses to investigate the intellectual expression and cultural practices of the ancient and modern worlds. We study the humanities to challenge our assumptions in order to move towards a deeper understanding of the world. Courses in the humanities allow us to explore personal and community values, cultural views, religious beliefs, and aesthetic practices and theories. Engagement with the humanities allows us to sharpen our critical and creative thinking, to ask penetrating questions, to communicate effectively, and to develop an informed and empathetic worldview. Through the humanities we become dedicated lifelong learners. These habits of mind well-position students for careers in a diverse array of fields. Graduates from humanities programs pursue successful careers in education, law, creative and professional writing, marketing and international business, social media production and management, government, the nonprofit sector, arts administration, and the helping professions.
