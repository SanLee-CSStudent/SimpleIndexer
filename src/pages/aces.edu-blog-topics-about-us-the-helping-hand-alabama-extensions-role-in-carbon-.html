Whether it be planting cover crops or improving cattle efficiencies, farmers and landowners are using these practices to help reduce carbon emissions. However, it is common to wonder where these sustainable practices come from? This is where the Alabama Extension Cooperative System steps in. Led by science, researchers and professionals are on the front lines in developing carbon-capturing practices that create a better Alabama. The Science Behind Carbon Becky Barlow, the Alabama Extension interim assistant director for agriculture, forestry and natural resource programs, said Extension implements several programs that help farmers and landowners deal with carbon emissions. \u201CSome of the programs are in the form of creating new opportunities to use alternative practices with fertilizers, cover crops, no-till planting and more,\u201D Barlow said. \u201CExtension\u2019s role in sustainable practices is to help producers implement the science-based information behind those practices into their operations.\u201D Audrey Gamble, an Extension soil scientist, works on extensive soil research. This research deals with the improvement of soil organic matter and conservation of natural resources. Learn more about the science behind her research in Soil Carbon: Food for the Soil. Jessica Kelton, an Extension agronomic crops regional agent, works to educate producers on the ever-evolving carbon commodity market. Learn more about carbon credits in Carbon Credits: Crop Producers\u2019 Latest Role in Sustainability Adam Maggard, an Extension forestry specialist, educates landowners on sustainable forestry practices. He also works to share information on the environmental benefits related to the adoption of more sustainable wood products.

Wilmer Pacheco, an Extension poultry specialist, works on research that improves efficiency within the poultry industry.

Kim Mullenix, an Extension beef systems specialist, works with producers to implement management practices that improve efficiency within their operation.

Producers are Partners in Sustainability Barlow said the involvement of Alabama producers in Extension research is key to the adoption of these practices. \u201CWhat we have learned is producers that are using sustainable practices now are much more likely to use more in the future if they are exposed to them,\u201D she said. \u201CThrough Extension, we can give producers the tools to help them do that.\u201D Also, Barlow said establishing partnerships with producers helps further extend the reach of sustainable practices. Producers that use these practices on their own operations are much better influencers to other producers. By partnering with Extension, these producers act as brand ambassadors of science-based research. \u201CIf you have someone that is actually doing the work in the field, they are much more believable than say someone in academia,\u201D Barlow said. \u201CIf we in Extension can work closely with farmers that we have a good relationship with, they are then influencers in the future to other farmers to really help spread those sustainable practices widely.\u201D A Trusted Source The land grant mission of institutions like Alabama A&M and Auburn universities is built on three pillars: research, teaching and extension. Barlow said it is Extension professionals\u2019 job to take university-generated information and put it into formats that residents can utilize. \u201CBecause of our close working relationships with the public, it is so important that we are a trusted source for that information and that we are giving them good science-based information that is going to help improve their lives,\u201D she said.
