A foundational principle of the HSI is that hunger is a solvable problem, but only when the relevant knowledge from all academic disciplines is combined with the abilities and strengths of all sectors. By creating multi-sector partnerships at the community, state and global levels, HSI shares knowledge and best practices and creates multi-sector coalitions to leverage the power of collective action.
