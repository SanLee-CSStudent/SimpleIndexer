Students who participate in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Pre-Law Program in the Department of Criminal Justice have access to pre-law advising, an academic minor, and activities designed to build pre-professional competencies, including legal research and critical thinking. UAB\u2019s Pre-Law Program partnered with Redemption Earned, Inc. for the new Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) Pre-Law Student Initiative. Clockwise from top left: Brandon Blankenship, Paul Littlejohn, Martha Earwood, Darrius Culpepper, Shae Thomas, Sue Bell Cobb.According to Brandon Blankenship, J.D., assistant professor in the Department of Criminal Justice and director of the Pre-Law Program, these skills\u2014along with many others\u2014consistently prove to be valuable when practicing law or working in careers in law. In addition to the core competencies, Blankenship also emphasizes community engagement and restorative leadership with his pre-law students. \u201C[We\u2019re] proactively building community,\u201D said Blankenship. Engaging Students For Blankenship, community-building often begins with engaging middle and high school students in hands-on learning experiences. One of the longest-standing experiences available through the Pre-Law Program is Journey to Attorney, an innovative summer camp for rising high school juniors and seniors that includes mock mediation and mock trials. During the camp, UAB pre-law students support camp participants as they retry a historic case (the last camp focused on the Scottsboro Nine case). Attendees dig into the facts of the case and aim to achieve a just result\u2014an effort that often requires 12-hour days and intensive preparation. As the students retry the case, they also examine ways in which they can restore justice in the community. The experience builds knowledge, relationships, and empathy, and, often, inspires participants to become life-long learners. Although the camp will not take place in Summer 2022, it will reemerge in Summer 2023. Along with engaging high school students in hands-on summer learning experiences, Blankenship and his team also find opportunities to reach students in classrooms. Megan Edwards, an AmeriCorps VISTA with the program, recently helped coordinate and facilitate a digital learning experience for middle school students in Shelby County for Law Day 2022. The American Bar Association (ABA) annually sponsors Law Day on May 1. According to the ABA, the program aims to celebrate the role of law in our society and to cultivate a deeper understanding of the legal profession. To support the mission of Law Day 2022, Edwards recruited judges and district attorneys from across the state of Alabama to record engaging video presentations for Shelby County students based on the following theme: \u201CToward a More Perfect Union: The Constitution in Times of Change.\u201D Edwards also made the videos available to the Alabama State Bar, so the organization could share the content with schools outside of Shelby County. According to Blankenship, Judge Bill Bostick\u2014the presiding judge on the Circuit 18 court in Shelby County\u2014delivered one of the most compelling video presentations. Bostick shared insights with the students and also gave them a virtual tour of his courtroom. For Blankenship, this kind of exposure to the legal profession is a driving force behind the community engagement work of the pre-law program. And, based on the feedback he received from one of the teachers who shared the video presentation with her class, it\u2019s working. \"My 7th and 8th grade students thoroughly enjoyed the Law Day 2022 experience. The program was well produced and offered such a variety of speakers,\u201D said Julie P. Kennedy, social studies teacher at Oak Mountain Middle School. \u201CIt was intriguing to hear from our county and state judges, attorneys, and state representative and the impact they have on the lives of our community. Hopefully, their words inspired my students to give back to their communities when they are older.\" JEDI Students at Oak Mountain Middle School participated in Law Day 2022.

In the case of the newly-established Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) Pre-Law Student Initiative, UAB students get the opportunity to develop competencies that will help them in law school, while also supporting community organizations and attorneys that have limited resources and staff. Blankenship developed the service-learning program in partnership with Brandon Wolfe, former Assistant Vice President for Campus and Community Engagement in UAB\u2019s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The program is now managed by an undergraduate student, Parth Sharma, who is majoring in criminal justice and mathematics and serving a Fellowship in Restorative Justice and Leadership. The fellowship was made possible by the LifeCrafter Foundation, a strategic partner of the Pre-Law program that provides substantial support in the form of scholarships and AmeriCorps VISTAs. This past academic year, the JEDI program created an opportunity for Eshandae (\u201CShae\u201D) Thomas\u2014a pre-law student who is majoring in criminal justice and minoring in legal affairs\u2014to work alongside Redemption Earned, Inc., a nonprofit organization that identifies, assists, and represents incarcerated individuals worthy of parole or work release. Sue Bell Cobb, former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, serves as the executive director of Redemption Earned, Inc. and sought out meaningful opportunities for Thomas to support the organization\u2019s work. \u201CAll of us were so excited when Professors Brandon Blankenship and Martha Earwood informed us that Redemption Earned, Inc. would be given the opportunity to work with a UAB pre-law intern,\u201D said Cobb. \u201CShae Thomas was simply extraordinary and completely dedicated to our efforts to assist worthy \u2018aged and infirmed\u2019 incarcerated individuals with gaining parole. Shae helped us synthesize and manage reams of data from the Alabama Department of Corrections. She provided valuable insight as we developed processes to be able to chart a new path to fill this huge gap in the criminal justice system. Her help was invaluable.\u201D Thomas conducted research and developed a system to identify potential clients for Redemption Earned, Inc. Along the way, Thomas also received mentorship and guidance from Darrius Culpepper, a law fellow at Redemption Earned, Inc., and Paul Littlejohn, a subject matter expert who experienced incarceration for 35 years. \u201CMy time with Redemption Earned has shown me how time can change people,\u201D said Thomas. \u201CIt's something we hear all the time, but I got to experience it firsthand.\u201D That experience led her to present at UAB\u2019s Service Learning and Undergraduate Research Expo. Thomas created a poster highlighting her research and work with Redemption Earned, Inc., and she went on to win first place in the Social and Behavioral Sciences for Online Poster Presentations. Moving Forward As Blankenship reflects on Thomas\u2019 research and accomplishments, he acknowledges the value of students \u201Cbuilding a body of work\u201D and doing work that energizes them. Now, Blankenship\u2019s vision for experiential learning has uncovered a new priority for future community engagement efforts within the program. Moving forward, Blankenship and his team plan to focus their attention on ensuring that students in Alabama are reading on grade-level by the fourth grade. At first, some may wonder how literacy fits into the community work of the Pre-Law Program\u2014for Blankenship, the answer is clear. \u201CI see pre-law as cradle to grave. I really think our pre-law journey, as far as UAB\u2019s concerned, really starts with elementary-level reading,\u201D said Blankenship. \u201CIf our [pre-law] students can participate in helping students be on grade-level with their reading by fourth grade, then those fourth graders have an opportunity to one day practice law\u2026 if that\u2019s what they want to do.\u201D And, perhaps, that is the overarching goal of the UAB Pre-Law program. Connecting students of all ages with learning experiences and community partners to ensure anyone who wishes to pursue a career in law can do so. Thankfully, the program is getting closer to achieving that goal each day. back to top UAB\u2019s Pre-Law Program making an impact outside of the classroom Students who participate in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Pre-Law Program in the Department of Criminal Justice have access to pre-law advising, an academic minor, and activities designed to build pre-professional competencies, including legal research and critical thinking.

Applied Professional Spanish students build awareness and skills through service-learning partnership Students are applying their knowledge and skills in real-world settings through a collaborative service-learning partnership between the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures and the Alabama Interfaith Refugee Partnership (ALIRP). Students in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s (UAB) College of Arts and Sciences are applying their knowledge and skills in real-world settings through a collaborative service-learning partnership between the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures and the Alabama Interfaith Refugee Partnership (ALIRP). In Fall 2021, Lourdes S?nchez-L?pez, Ph.D, professor of Spanish in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, taught SPA 485 Spanish for Leadership at the Workplace, a capstone course for the Applied Professional Spanish major concentration. In the course, students develop leadership skills, explore career pathways, and practice their applied professional Spanish through service-learning. Since the course has a strong emphasis on service-learning, S?nchez-L?pez connects students with well-established community partners to explore and transform Birmingham\u2019s linguistic landscape. By doing so, the students\u2014alongside the community partner(s)\u2014make public spaces more accessible, inclusive, and welcoming to the Spanish-speaking community. In the fall, S?nchez-L?pez connected 15 of her students with the ALIRP, an interfaith group of religious leaders and laypersons who help refugees and asylum-seekers. Throughout the semester, students translated the organization\u2019s website and other resources to Spanish to make the information accessible to ALIRP¢¥s Spanish-speaking refugee families\u2014many of which are from Central America\u2014as well as for Spanish-speaking volunteers. \u201CThis service-learning project is meaningful, and it contributes greatly to the transformation of Birmingham¢¥s linguistic landscape,\u201D said S?nchez-L?pez. \u201CThe Applied Professional Spanish students made an important contribution in our joint journey to more equitable access to resources for all. I am very proud of each one of them.\u201D One of the course objectives for SPA 485 is for students \u201Cto acquire a more profound understanding and appreciation of one¢¥s own community.\u201D According to Lindi Deboer, a recent UAB alumna who participated in SPA 485, the course clearly achieved that goal. \u201CMy time working with the ALIRP was a humbling and rewarding experience. I was able to learn about the pressing issues impacting immigrant families, as well as the support the ALIRP gives them,\u201D said Deboer. \u201CAs a Spanish major, being able to help Hispanic immigrant families by translating the ALIRP\u2019s resource guide was very special. I could not have done it without such an amazing team\u2014Lisandra Carballoza Quesada, Dalton Scott, Jane Vines, Lynda Wilson, Katherine Fulcher, and Dr. S?nchez-L?pez\u2014who were very encouraging, attentive, and compassionate.\u201D The team at the ALIRP also viewed the experience as a success. Specifically, Lynda Wilson, president of the ALIRP, believes the partnership helped the organization reach more people and deepen its impact. \u201CThese resources will be extremely helpful for ALIRP volunteers and asylum-seeking families that we serve,\u201D said Wilson. \u201CThanks to this wonderful collaboration, the ALIRP will be able to expand its reach to the Spanish-speaking community in Birmingham and beyond. We are extremely grateful to Dr. S?nchez-L?pez for her leadership in developing this collaboration!\u201D Read more...

Kaye Cochran Nail, instructor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Department of History, is finding innovative ways for her History of Alabama (HC-116 2C) students to craft and share public history stories with audiences across the state. Prior to the Fall 2021 semester, Nail connected with Rebecca Minder, director of Alabama Heritage magazine, to co-create a new learning opportunity for undergraduate students at UAB. Minder quickly noted that the magazine\u2014which is officially co-published by UAB, the University of Alabama, and the Alabama Department of Archives and History\u2014has a popular blog that regularly needs well-researched and engaging content. Together, Nail and Minder decided the students were well-positioned to support this valuable storytelling effort. \u201CIt has turned out to be a great way for our UAB students to join with other students to publish blogs on interesting topics related to Alabama history,\u201D said Nail. So far, her students have published eight blogs on topics including the Tuskegee syphilis study, the Battle of Mobile Bay, and Lewis Smith Lake. Throughout the remainder of the semester, students will continue to author and publish pieces for the website. \"We are honored and excited to be working with the young scholars in Kaye Cochran Nail's Alabama history course this semester,\u201D said Susan E. Reynolds, Ph.D., editor of Alabama Heritage magazine. \u201CTheir contributions to our blog have been valuable to our readership, and we think it is wonderful that these students are taking an interest in our state's history. We hope to continue this partnership in the future so that more students will be able to engage in the Alabama history community.\u201D Moving forward, Nail hopes to deepen the partnership with Alabama Heritage magazine and create more opportunities for students to obtain hands-on experience with public history. According to Jonathan Wiesen, Ph.D., chair of the Department of History, \u201CIt is inspiring to see our students so engaged in Public History with these blog entries. This is exactly the kind of community engagement that I love to see at UAB\u2014students using their knowledge of history in service of educating our fellow Alabamians.\u201D Read the Alabama Heritage blog.

Departments host Constitution Day experience The overarching theme for this year was \u201CPublic Health and the Constitution.\u201D 13 student teams participated in the event representing 38 students. On Friday, September 17, 2021, in honor of Constitution Day and to fulfill the requirement of Public Law 108-447 (enacted in late 2004, which requires an educational institution receiving federal funds to hold an education program on the United States Constitution on this day for its students) the Department of Political Science and Public Administration and the Department of Criminal Justice sponsored a scavenger hunt across campus. The overarching theme for this year was \u201CPublic Health and the Constitution.\u201D Thirteen student teams participated in the event representing 38 students. Students were provided questions and a resource bank ahead of time to prepare for the event. Students competed in teams of three. Stations were posted throughout campus. Participating units included: Collat School of Business AEIVA Honors College Department of Philosophy Department of History Office of Service Learning and Undergraduate Research Career Center Lister Hill Center for Health Policy School of Public Health At each station, students were asked a specific question for which they were required to provide the correct answer to advance. Station masters initialed the team\u2019s score card before the team could leave for the next station. To avoid guessing, students received reduced points for each attempt at the question. Students also received points for their finishing time. One team was a clear winner with both the number of correct answers and the fastest time. That team was Maya Crocker, Roshan Dahale, and Anthony Venesia. Two teams tied for second place and three teams tied for third place. The 17 students representing the winning teams are invited to an educational encounter with Judge Elisabeth French. Judge French will make a presentation on her path to the judiciary and will be available to answer questions from the students. All students who participated, as well as station masters, received a pocket Constitution, which contains the entire Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Each member of the first-place team will also receive a Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. All student participants enjoyed Steele City Pops on the Campus Green after the event. Students commented that this event was fun, made constitutional law relevant to current events, and provided an opportunity for them to see parts of campus that they had not seen before. We also noted the significant exercise that students received in accumulating approximately 7,600 steps in completing the scavenger hunt. Professor Brandon Blankenship, director of UAB\u2019s Pre-Law Program, stated, \u201CI can't imagine an area of American life that is not impacted by the Constitution. It was encouraging to see students engage it in an energetic and physical way, some for the first time.\u201D Stacy Moak, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration, commented, \u201CI wanted students to see the Constitution in a practical way with a significant contemporary issue. Each of the 10 questions dealt with some issue of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as with federalism, separation of powers, and individual rights.\u201D The departments intend to make this an annual event. The theme will change from year to year depending upon current events. Read more... Supporting a global classroom A world traveler\u2019s planned gift helps students embark on journeys of transformation. William Doggett III, M.D., had an insatiable desire to travel and to learn. In fact, he believed that traveling was learning, says his brother David Doggett. \u201CForeign travel was not just a vacation or adventure to Bill,\u201D David says. \u201CIt was a way to explore and understand more of the world and more about himself, and knowing how to speak even a little of another language helped him do that.\u201D Study abroad was a critical component of William\u2019s education. He spent a semester in France while pursuing his undergraduate degree, and after earning his medical degree from UAB, he attended summer institutes in England and France. William, who passed away in 2012, spent 35 years as an internist and pulmonary specialist in Birmingham. During his career, he took more than 40 courses at UAB on all sorts of topics\u2014German language, Russian literature, piano, art, astronomy, and more. \u201CHis learning experiences at UAB were probably his greatest source of delight,\u201D David says. To share his passions and to thank UAB for the many ways it contributed to his quality of life, William left a bequest to establish the Dr. William E. Doggett III Endowed Support Fund for the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures and to support the existing Grace Lindsley Waits Endowed Scholarship, which he had previously established. \u201CMy brother wanted his gift to enable others to expand their experience of the world through the study of language,\u201D David says. The fund is accomplishing that goal, says Erika Rinker, Ph.D., assistant professor of German at UAB. \u201CDr. Doggett has given a gift greater than the monetary value of international airfare when he made possible the transformative experience of a summer, a semester, or a year in another country,\u201D she says. \u201CStudents who feel supported in their study of another language, and especially those who enjoy the privilege of enriching their educations abroad, serve as ambassadors and return as advocates voicing their own support for the very initiatives and priorities identified by the College of Arts and Sciences,\u201D Rinker notes. \u201CThey become our most genuine global citizen-scholars, and I am grateful to be able to work with the Doggett family to help extend our students\u2019 worldviews.\u201D Two students who have benefited from William Doggett\u2019s generosity describe experiences abroad that have advanced their education and prepared them for successful careers: Leah Perz: Study abroad in Paris, France \u201CMy first study abroad experience was a month in Paris on a UAB faculty-led trip. I was awarded the Dr. William E. Doggett III Endowed Study Abroad Scholarship in Foreign Languages and Literatures, and that helped make the trip a reality by offsetting many expenses. My mornings were spent in French classes at a language institute in the heart of the city, and I had the afternoons to explore Paris and immerse myself in the culture. During my last full day in the city, I explored the area near the Arc de Triomphe. I walked along the Champs-?lys?es and located the underground tunnel that gives access to the Arc, which sits on an island surrounded by four lanes of traffic. To get to the top, I climbed the tiniest spiraling staircase, which was full of people\u2014and I can get claustrophobic. But I was rewarded with the most incredible view of the city. A lot of people think the view from the Eiffel Tower is the best, but I loved this panoramic view because I could also enjoy that iconic landmark while taking in the City of Lights. That month made me realize how much I want to improve my language learning and spend more time in France. In the fall, I\u2019m planning to spend a semester in Lyon, France. I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d be able to afford the trip, but then I was awarded the Dr. William E. Doggett III Endowed Scholarship for Foreign Languages and Literatures. It will be my main source of financial aid during the semester and has allowed me to feel comfortable making this decision. Because of Dr. Doggett\u2019s generosity, I can keep working toward my goal of fluency and a greater understanding of another culture.\u201D Leah Perz graduated May 2020 with a B.A. degree in international studies and a B.A. in foreign languages with a French concentration. She\u2019s from Moody, Alabama, and plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree and eventually work in transnational anti-human trafficking endeavors. Meghan Ballard: Study abroad in Salamanca, Spain \u201CI spent five weeks in Salamanca this past summer, thanks to the Dr. William E. Doggett III Endowed Study Abroad Scholarship in Foreign Languages and Literatures. I had taken about five years of Spanish, but I wasn\u2019t sure how I would do talking with people who didn\u2019t speak any English. I got to live with a host family, and that experience helped me tremendously. I feel a lot more accomplished and able to speak confidently now. My roommate and I\u2014another UAB student who ended up becoming one of my best friends\u2014would have lunch and dinner with my host family every day. And on the weekends, we occasionally would join them on hikes. One was especially memorable. It was 12 miles long\u2014quite far for us, but for my family who is used to walking everywhere, it was nothing. By the end of the hike, my friend and I were exhausted. We could barely move. But I\u2019ll never forget that day because we got to see parts of the Spanish countryside we\u2019d never seen before. And we got to experience what my host family does for fun. I had been saving money to make this trip happen, but I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to afford it until I received the scholarship. Living abroad gave me an education I never would have had in the classroom. I experienced food, people, culture. Plus I improved in my Spanish-speaking abilities. I would highly recommend studying abroad to anyone studying a foreign language.\u201D Meghan Ballard graduated in May 2020 with a B.S. in psychology and a B.A. in foreign languages with a Spanish concentration.

Translating with the future in mind During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lourdes S?nchez-L?pez, Ph.D., professor of Spanish in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, received an unexpected invitation. Lourdes S?nchez-L?pez, Ph.D.During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lourdes S?nchez-L?pez, Ph.D., professor of Spanish in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, received an unexpected invitation. At the time, public health experts and campus communicators across UAB were working swiftly to share information about the emerging pandemic with faculty, students, staff, and the community. The effort \u2014 now known as UAB United \u2014 was instrumental in raising awareness of the pandemic and prompting people across UAB and beyond to take measures to limit risk and exposure to the virus. That said, the team behind the campaign recognized one substantial gap in its communications assets \u2014 everything was in English. S?nchez-L?pez is an avid proponent of making Birmingham a more equitable and inclusive community for Spanish-speaking residents. So, when UAB reached out and asked for her assistance in translating the COVID-19 messages for those residents, she did not hesitate to offer her expertise and support. She, along with her colleague Mar?a Antonia Anderson de la Torre, Ph.D., translated the website content and signage in a relatively short period of time and learned a lot along the way. Through this experience, S?nchez-L?pez was inspired to take a broader, systems level view of the issue presented by the UAB United campaign. As she contemplated future translation projects, she looked to her service learning courses (FLL 333 \u2013 Foreign Language Service Learning and SPA 485 \u2013 Spanish for Leadership in the Workplace) in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. Historically, the courses included significant capstone projects where students worked alongside nonprofit organizatiosn to address a challenge or opportunity \u2014 clearly, there was a need to reimagine the capstone component of the courses during the pandemic. \"I knew students could not be in the community due to COVID-19,\" said S?nchez-L?pez. \"I decided to ask my students to help nonprofits that serve the Latinx community and translate their website content, therefore addressing the disparity in our linguistic landscape.\" Emma Kate Sellers was one of the students in S?nchez-L?pez's Foreign Language Service Learning class and is also pursuing her Spanish for Specific Purposes Certificate. For her capstone, she translated content for the 1917 Clinic at UAB, the largest HIV health care unit in Alabama and one of the country\u2019s leading HIV clinics. S?nchez-L?pez encouraged Sellers to work with the 1917 Clinic because she knew the institution aligned with Sellers's interests and passions. Her project was entitled, \"Improving Access to HIV Care for Spanish-Speakers at UAB's 1917 Clinic,\" which she presented at the 2021 UAB Expo and garnered her the first place award in the service learning category. \"Service-learning allows students to apply the content we learn in the classroom to real-life situations, which is what I was able to do by working with the 1917 Clinic to translate their website,\" said Sellers. \"In class, we covered the importance of translation and interpretation in making healthcare more accessible to non-English speakers, which I was able to apply through my service-learning project.\" Other students in the Spanish for Leadership class partnered with nonprofit organizations outside of UAB, including the Coosa Riverkeeper, Cahaba Valley Health Care, and the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese. For each student, S?nchez-L?pez aimed to illuminate potential career pathways. Through the capstone projects, some students, including Sellers, actually discovered they do not wish to pursue careers in translation, which, according to S?nchez-L?pez, is a valuable insight to uncover before graduating and entering the workforce. \"While I do not want to be a translator in the future, this course did solidify my passion for health equity and collaborating with community partners, and I am grateful that myself, the clinic, and patients all benefitted from this partnership,\" said Sellers. According to S?nchez-L?pez, these first-ever website translation projects deepened relationships with community partners and catalyzed long-term change for Spanish-speaking residents in Birmingham and the community\u2019s linguistic landscape. \"It's a sustainable approach,\" said S?nchez-L?pez.

On May 1, Parker Rose graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from the University of Alabama at Birmingham's College of Arts and Sciences. Rose navigated rigorous coursework and built long-lasting relationships while pursuing her degree \u2013 those experiences, according to Rose, substantially impacted her approach to living and learning in the world. During her time at UAB, Rose served as president of the UAB Philosophy Club for two years, was the student representative for the Department of Philosophy, and was also an opinion columnist for Kaleidoscope, UAB\u2019s student-run news outlet. Rose plans to pursue her Ph.D. in philosophy and was accepted into the esteemed doctoral program at UCLA beginning this fall. Rose credits UAB for providing an environment that ensures the growth of its students. \"It was this environment that really allowed me to flourish and in which I learned what I was truly capable of,\" she said. Rose made a profound impression on faculty members across the Department of Philosophy, including department chair David Chan, Ph.D. and Brynn Welch, Ph.D., a recipient of the 2021 Dean\u2019s Award for Excellence in Teaching. \"Parker is exceptional in every way: brilliant, hard-working, reflective, and just such a wonderfully kind person,\" said Welch, assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy. \"I'm over the moon about her success but not the least bit surprised by it. UCLA is very lucky to have her. We certainly have been.\" Rose was awarded the prestigious Beinecke Scholarship in 2020 to pursue graduate education, becoming UAB\u2019s first-ever Beinecke Scholar. The scholarship provides awardees $4,000 immediately before entering graduate school and an additional $30,000 while attending graduate school. The Beinecke Scholarship Program encourages and enables exceptional students to pursue a graduate course of study in the arts, humanities, or social sciences. Each participating institution in the Beinecke Scholarship Program may nominate only one student and Rose was chosen as UAB\u2019s 2020 nominee. Rose also expressed thanks to her mentors and advisors in the Department of Philosophy and the College of Arts and Sciences. \"My mentors in the philosophy department taught me the value of collaboration, openness, and encouraging one another towards getting to the truth over winning an argument,\" said Rose. \u201CIn my experiences at UAB more broadly, I was consistently impressed by the level of care and attention that advisors put into ensuring an ideal environment for the growth of their students.\u201D Read more... Double major Veronica Mixon has a passion for mental health advocacy Pursuing a double major requires focus, effort, and passion. Add a global pandemic to the situation, and the experience becomes even more complex. Pursuing a double major requires focus, effort, and passion. Add a global pandemic to the situation, and the experience becomes even more complex. Veronica Mixon, a graduating senior in the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences who will earn a Bachelor of Arts in African American Studies and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology this spring, navigated the experience with grace. \u201CSince I\u2019ve been at UAB, I\u2019ve learned the importance of self-care and community. I\u2019m on the spectrum for Autism, and, before UAB, I always felt isolation and exhausted from masking 24\/7,\u201D said Mixon. \u201CHowever, I learned how to manage my self-care and create boundaries that made it easier to feel comfortable in social settings. My experiences in the African American Studies Program really helped lay the foundation of my growth through the support I received from my mentors, professors, and friends.\u201D According to her professors and mentors, Mixon did in fact lay a strong foundation from which she grew and thrived. Her hard work garnered her both praise and scholarship opportunities throughout her tenure at UAB. She is a McNair Scholar and earned both the College of Arts and Science\u2019s Dean\u2019s Leadership Scholarship and the African American Studies Director\u2019s Award. Also, she won the 2021 College of Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Dean\u2019s Award and the Outstanding Student Award for African American Studies, and, last April, she was initiated into the historic Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi. \u201CVeronica is passionate about learning and an advocate of social justice. She is not afraid to speak out on issues affecting the quality of life in our society or show compassion towards those who need a \u2018voice,\u2019\u201D said Kathryn Morgan, Ph.D., director of the African American Studies Program. \u201CIn my academic career, I have encountered students who are certain to succeed and sure to make a difference. I find myself grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the educational experience of these students. Veronica is one such student.\u201D Alongside her academic pursuits and achievements, Mixon is also the President of the African American Studies Organization, a Research Assistant in C.L.A.Y.S Lab in the Department of Psychology, and a mental health advocate. Her commitment to and interest in mental health will lead her to become one of the first students to attain the Certificate in Mental Health from the Department of Psychology this spring. Also, as a result of her work as an intern, mentor, and suicide prevention advocate, UAB\u2019s Student Counseling Services named her a Mental Health Champion. Through courses like Black Psychology and an emphasis in global health and justice studies, Mixon has found numerous points of intersection between African American studies and psychology. Recently, she shared her insights at a panel entitled \u201CBreaking Down Barriers: Supporting Marginalized Communities During COVID-19,\u201D which was sponsored by Kognito, a health simulation company. By building her critical thinking skills with an interdisciplinary focus, she is now in a position to pursue her career goals. Mixon looks to the future with both optimism and excitement. \u201CAfter graduation, I will be attending the Community Psychology Master\u2019s Program at Florida A&M University,\u201D said Mixon. \u201CI plan to do a thesis and focus on mental health, racial identity, and social connectedness among people of African Descent. After my master\u2019s, I plan to apply to clinical psychology Ph.D. programs!\u201D Dr. Morgan is also optimistic about Mixon\u2019s future. \u201CShe achieves excellence in everything that she does, and I know, without reservation, that she will be excellent in her future endeavors,\u201D said Dr. Morgan. As Mixon prepares to graduate magna cum laude with distinguished honors and reflects on this past year, she has many thoughts regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201CI think UAB students did an amazing job of being resilient,\u201D said Mixon. \u201CIt\u2019s important for us to give ourselves grace and not put ourselves to an unrealistic standard when we had so many negative things come our way. I genuinely believe that everyone overcame the semester in the best way they could.\u201D Read more... Musical Theatre grads look to the future This academic year has been unlike any other. Students and faculty have navigated unprecedented complexity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, over the course of the past 14 months, they have exemplified resiliency and creativity. Justine Grace Nelson, Laurel Floen, and Diego Villanueva This academic year has been unlike any other. Students and faculty have navigated unprecedented complexity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, over the course of the past 14 months, they have exemplified resiliency and creativity. In the College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 Department of Theatre, three graduating seniors are preparing for their next steps, while taking some time to reflect on their experiences over the past year. \"Obviously, this was not the senior year any of us had planned,\u201D said Justine Grace Nelson, a senior who will earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Musical Theatre this spring. \u201CWe have taken advantage of technology and created professional online presences showcasing our work and learned so much about the business side of the industry this year.\u201D By leveraging technology and an adaptable spirit, the faculty in the Department of Theatre have ensured students still receive a world-class educational experience even when they are remote and\/or wearing masks and socially distanced. \u201CI have been so inspired by these strong and resilient students and artists,\u201D said Valerie Accetta, Head of Musical Theatre at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201CThis is not at all the senior year they envisioned when they started at UAB, but even in the midst of a global pandemic, they have continued to do committed work and claim their unique artistic voices.\u201D One of Accetta\u2019s inspiring students is Laurel Floen. As she approaches graduation, Floen recently reflected on her experience in the musical theatre program and uncovered an eye-opening discovery. \u201CWhen we turn the spotlight off ourselves and use it to shine light outwards through our work, that\u2019s when we hit gold,\u201D said Floen. Floen also feels a deep and unwavering bond with her fellow musical theatre seniors, including Nelson and Diego Villanueva. For Villanueva, the pandemic did not stop him from envisioning a future that is dynamic and bright. \u201COnce I graduate, I will be headed to Rehoboth, Delaware joining Clear Space Theatre in their summer season,\u201D said Villanueva. Afterwards, he will participate in a year-long apprenticeship with the Florida Repertory Theatre in Fort Myers, Florida, then he will be off to New York City. Nelson is also pursuing her dreams in the Sunshine State. \u201CI am currently in Florida already working on my first professional post-grad production as Peppermint Patty in ThinkTank\u2019s production of Snoopy,\" said Nelson. In August, Floen plans to move to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to start an internship with Good to Go Theater. Philadelphia also presents Floen with an added benefit \u2013 proximity to New York City. \u201CI might even take the two-hour train ride to New York City to visit friends and audition more once everything opens again,\u201D said Floen. All three students note their appreciation for the faculty in the Department of Theatre for providing immense support and mentorship during this unpredictable year. For Accetta, creating such a nurturing environment was a pleasure. \u201CLaurel, Justine, and Diego are simply beautiful humans, and I feel so lucky to have shared in their journey,\u201D Accetta said.

Sociology professors and students partner with Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service When Battalion Chief Tobias Jones was collecting information for a Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service (BFRS) strategic planning project, he thought of the UAB Department of Sociology. When Battalion Chief Tobias Jones was collecting information for a Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service (BFRS) strategic planning project, he thought of the UAB Department of Sociology. Jones had once taken the department\u2019s research methodology course when he was a UAB student and knew the Department of Sociology would have the resources to conduct a study that would cost the BFRS thousands of dollars if they hired a commercial firm. So, working with Birmingham Fire Chief Cory D. Moon, they contacted Verna Keith, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Sociology. It was precisely the type of community engagement service the department seeks to provide. \u201CI saw Chief Moon\u2019s request as an excellent opportunity to contribute to the community and to expose our students to a collaborative and impactful research experience. That he reached out to the department for this project speaks highly of our faculty and their excellent instruction,\u201D said Dr. Keith. Cullen Clark, Ph.D.Soon after, students and professors from two courses had signed on to conduct two studies. Under the supervision of Elizabeth Baker, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Sociology, students in her Research Experience course developed a quantitative survey designed to measure community knowledge and perceptions of BFRS. Additionally, a team of capstone students from the department\u2019s online Master of Arts in Applied Sociology program worked with Cullen Clark, Ph.D., teaching assistant professor in the Department of Sociology, to conduct a series of online focus groups with members of selected neighborhood associations to gather their perceptions and knowledge of BFRS. With key support from Chief Moon, Battalion Chief Kenneth Mines, Lieutenant Brian Pernell, Firefighter Jeffrey Hall, the Strategic Plan Committee, and Battalion Chief Jones, the project was an opportunity for students to take the skills they learned in the classroom and put them to work. \u201CThis project allowed the students to participate firsthand in the research process and provided them with an opportunity to show potential employers the diverse skill set that a degree in sociology can afford,\u201D said Dr. Baker. \u201CAt the end of the class, they had produced a report from data derived from a survey they designed, disseminated, and analyzed.\u201D Elizabeth Baker, Ph.D.It was a great opportunity for the graduate students as well, recalled Dr. Clark. \u201CWe always tell students in our online M.A. program that every sociologist works with a toolkit that consists of social theory, research methodology, and what sociologists call the \u2018sociological imagination,\u2019 or the ability to see how broader social and historical forces shape individual lives,\u201D said Dr. Clark. \u201CProjects like this one enable our students to see firsthand just how versatile these tools are and that they can be used to provide insight and information for any organization,\u201D said Dr. Clark. Together, the quantitative and qualitative studies provided a greater depth of insight than either could have provided alone. One finding that clearly stood out in both studies was the high esteem in which respondents held BFRS. \u201CI don\u2019t think I have ever done focus groups where no one has anything negative to say,\u201D said Dr. Clark. Another interesting finding was the extent to which respondents said they had used BFRS emergency medical services at some point. Forty-one percent of the respondents to the quantitative online survey indicated they had used these services. This finding was reiterated by moving personal accounts of focus group members\u2019 interactions with emergency medical services. The UAB Department of Sociology is happy to conduct projects like this as resources permit. Community, charitable and civic groups who would like this type of assistance should contact Dr. Verna Keith at vmkeith@uab.edu. Read more... Student Spotlight: Levi Sanford Senior Levi Sanford changed his major and found both inspiration and a career path. Photo: Macey HobsonChoosing one\u2019s major, like making art, takes an open mind. Levi Sanford, a senior art major focusing on graphic design, knew he wanted to attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham but his heart was not always set on graphic design. Before transferring to UAB, Sanford was a nursing major at Bevill State Community College. Emily Schumann: You mentioned that you always knew you\u2019d end up at UAB. Why? Levi Sanford: I always saw myself going to UAB for their medical school. When I changed my major to general studies at Bevill, I decided I wanted to go into art as I got more into my creative side. I saw an ad for a graphic design program online and wondered whether or not UAB had one. I saw that they did and it felt right. It was what I really wanted to do and what I felt like I\u2019d be a lot happier doing. ES: Was there a particular class or teacher in CAS that was especially formative to who you are as a creative person? LS: The first class I had at UAB was a Digital Imaging class, ARS 103, with Doug Barrett. I remember being really nervous for his class and he was a very helpful instructor. I mean, all of the instructors in the College of Arts and Sciences are so helpful, it\u2019s amazing. They really do push you to be better. Before UAB, I had never opened Illustrator or InDesign and didn\u2019t know anything about Photoshop, but now I can whip up shirt designs in Illustrator. It was so helpful and inspiring because they pushed me as a creative. I appreciate that now. Self-doubt is the biggest thing. You\u2019re so hard on yourself but they help you push past that. ES: How have you developed your professional eye and creative style at UAB? LS: It\u2019s definitely developed over time. I have friends in classes I [took in previous semesters]. It\u2019s nice to see that I was once at that point, and now I\u2019m able to help them. One of the biggest parts of being an artist is discovering your style. I\u2019m a very retro, vintage-oriented person with a modern edge. A UAB t-shirt designed by Levi Sanford. Photo: Emily Schumann Art is subjective, so what someone likes might not be what I like. It\u2019s a trial-and-error process. That applies to most art. Most experiences, really. ES: How has UAB helped you identify your career goals? LS: When people first asked me what I wanted to do with my degree, I had a hard time answering because the possibilities are so broad. Hearing [faculty] experiences has helped me narrow my options. The variety of projects you complete also helps you sample different paths. Bloom Studio [run by Doug Barrett in the Department of Art and Art History] is technically a class but it\u2019s like an internship because we work with real clients. We are currently helping rebrand Klein Arts and Culture, a non-profit based in Harpersville, AL. Personally, I like the idea of working for one of the larger marketing\/advertising agencies in Birmingham. It\u2019s fast-paced, but the idea of constantly being able to put out work and different projects in an intense environment seems like a great way to gain experience. ES: Would you say UAB was the right choice? LS: UAB has been a great call. I don\u2019t want to say everything happens for a reason because that\u2019s such a broad thing, but I\u2019m glad that this happened. It\u2019s hard to picture where I\u2019d be if I wasn\u2019t here. I\u2019ve grown so much as a person here and I\u2019ve developed so many skills. The UAB campus is diverse and there are so many people to learn from and connections to be made. It\u2019s not an art school, but I feel like you get almost the same education while saving the money you would spend at an art school. Photo of book cover and artwork by Levi Sanford ES: Do you have any advice for incoming UAB students? LS: Be open-minded. Be open to hearing opinions from other people because it is so vital to hear what others have to say. Don\u2019t assume your ideas are better than what others might have to offer. Come ready to learn, to be yourself, and be prepared to be humbled. Interested in graphic design? Learn more about our majors and concentrations in the Department of Art and Art History. Read more...

Undergraduate Neuroscience Program's Outstanding Seniors: Sid Chandra Sid Chandra, a senior majoring in the Undergraduate Neuroscience Program, writes about his experiences in the program and at UAB. Sid Chandra, a senior majoring in the Undergraduate Neuroscience Program, writes about his experiences in the program and at UAB. When I was a freshman in high school, my grandfather was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, an untreatable neurodegenerative condition. Over the years, I watched my grandfather lose the ability to recognize and communicate with the people closest to him. It was frustrating to watch him suffer and not be able to do anything to help him. I began to read about his condition and similar neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. To understand disease research articles, I needed to understand the basic biology of the brain, so I read Neuroscience for Dummies by Frank Amthor, a UAB neurobiologist. I began to become fascinated by the brain and diseases that cause it to malfunction. When deciding where to attend college, UAB attracted me because of the strong neuroscience research, the well-established Undergraduate Neuroscience Program (UNP), and the resources available to students from the UAB Honors College. Soon after joining UAB, I began to seek out research mentors. With help from Dr. Cristin Gavin, co-director of the UNP, and Dr. Diane Tucker, director of the Science and Technology Honors Program, I was able to join the lab of Dr. Andy West, an expert in Parkinson\u2019s disease. In the West lab, I focused on studying the role of a protein kinase called LRRK2 in rodent models of Parkinson\u2019s disease and strategies to target LRRK2 for therapeutic benefit. After three years of working with Dr. West, he moved to continue his career at Duke University, and I joined Dr. Talene Yacoubian\u2019s lab. In Yacoubian lab, I have focused on understanding how modulation of the 14-3-3 protein influences neuropathology in rodent models of Parkinson\u2019s disease. I have been fortunate to publish my results in peer reviewed journals, communicate my science across the country at several regional and national conferences, and win competitive fellowships to support my research during the summers. My experiences in the West and Yacoubian labs have solidified my interest in basic and translational research and affirmed that I want these practices to be a significant part of my career. Outside of the lab, I have been heavily involved with UAB Student Multicultural and Diversity Programs as a Free Food for Thought facilitator, board member of the Social Justice Advocacy Council, and a SMDP retreat leader. Through these endeavors, I have had the opportunity to advocate for marginalized groups and help educate my peers on social issuing plaguing our world. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work substantially with the UAB Honors College as a communications chair for the Honors College Leadership Council and as an Honors College Ambassador. Through my experiences with SMDP and the Honors College, I have grown as a person and as a leader. I intend for advocacy to be an important part of my career going forward. All of my experiences and success at UAB could not have been accomplished without the help of several mentors \u2014 Drs. West, Gavin, Tucker, and Yacoubian (and many more). UAB is truly a unique university in that students here do not learn only in a classroom, but they are given experiential opportunities to grow professionally and personally. My experiences at UAB have inspired me to become a physician-scientist, so that I may investigate the molecular basis of disease, develop mechanism-based therapies, and treat patients directly in the clinic. By providing research opportunities, coursework, and fantastic mentorship, the UNP has fully prepared me for the challenges that lie ahead. This summer, I will begin an M.D.-Ph.D. program to start my journey of becoming a physician-scientist and join the fight against incurable disease. Read more...

Master's students win Best Graduate Paper at 2018 ACM Mid-Southeast conference The paper predicts the probability of basketball players achieving the prestigious honor of being granted access to the Hall of Fame. Two Department of Computer Science master's students, Trupesh Patel (M.S. in Computer Science) and Andrew Schatz (M.S. in Data Science), won the first place for the best graduate paper at the ACM Mid-Southeast 2018 conference. The paper, \"Classifying Basketball Players by Hall of Fame Merit,\" predicts the probability of basketball players achieving the prestigious honor of being granted access to the Hall of Fame. This project was done using various machine learning strategies and data mining skills, under the guidance of Professor Chengcui Zhang. Patel and Schatz's project was an obvious choice for best graduate paper at the conference, as it demonstrated a solid analysis and evaluation framework and pursued a unique goal. It was also one of the only projects at the conference that was not funded by any third-party organization, meaning that it out-performed many well-funded research projects. Participating in the ACM Mid-Southeast conferences is one of the most rewarding experiences for computer science students at UAB, and the department encourages current and future students to submit their projects to upcoming conferences. It is not only for graduate students \u2014 undergraduate students have their own category and this year greatly outnumbered graduate students. The conference encourages creativity in student projects, as seen by this submission and the undergraduate champion for best project, which was a 2D-style video game created by five students from Middle Tennessee State University. In addition to the rewarding experience, the conference location of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, is beautiful place and offers entertaining activities to conference attendees.
