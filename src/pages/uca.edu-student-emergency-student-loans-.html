Our mission is to help students connect to campus and community resources when a temporary financial setback threatens their academic success. Any student facing a financial emergency is encouraged to set an appointment online, by phone, or simply stop by the office. Please note that we normally meet by appointment only, and cannot guarantee that drop-ins will be seen the same day. In certain circumstances, appointments can be arranged to take place online via video call. If you have an urgent need for funding or need to meet remotely, please call or email to discuss your scheduling options. Remote meetings can only take place with prior approval. Most grants and scholarships offered through the Student Support & Resource Center are one-time only awards. One-time only refers to the entire time a person is a student at UCA regardless of changes in enrollment or classification. If interested, please contact the Student Support and Resource Center via email at studentsupport@uca.edu to set up an appointment or ask questions.
