UCA alumna and adjunct faculty member Kimberly Raup was recently selected as the 2022 Arkansas Computer Science Educator of the Year. Kimberly Raup, a three-time UCA graduate, received the award from Gov. Asa Hutchinson at the sixth annual Governor\u2019s All-State Coding Competition. She had initially won $2,500 after being chosen as one of five finalists but was awarded an additional $12,500 from the Arkansas Department of Education\u2019s Office of Computer Science when she was named the overall winner. A teacher at Conway High School, Raup had previously been a finalist for the award in 2019, 2020 and 2021 before capturing top honors this year. In addition to her CHS teaching role, she is also an adjunct faculty member in the College of Education\u2019s Department of Leadership Studies at UCA. \u201CI am very fortunate to receive this award,\u201D Raup said. \u201CWe have amazing and talented computer science educators in Arkansas. Each one brings his or her own special and unique skills but everyone has the same goal of helping our students be successful. Computer Science is so much more than learning a programming language.\u201D Raup earned a bachelor\u2019s in marketing from UCA in 1997 before returning to complete a bachelor\u2019s in business technology in 2004. She finished her master\u2019s in leadership studies with a focus on instructional technology at UCA in 2011. \u201CI am so proud of all of the students I have had over the years, both those who work in computer science fields and those who use their problem-solving skills in other professions,\u201D Raup added. \u201CAs teachers, we work so hard to make a difference for our students, and it is extremely rewarding to be recognized for that devotion.\u201D By Philip Allison Posted in: Alumni, Campus News, College of Business, College of Education, Faculty & Staff, Press Room on May 16, 2022 Archives Archives Select Month June 2022 May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 December 2004 November 2004 October 2004 September 2004 August 2004 July 2004 June 2004 May 2004 April 2004 March 2004 February 2004 January 2004 December 2003 November 2003 October 2003 September 2003 Social ? ? ? ? ?
