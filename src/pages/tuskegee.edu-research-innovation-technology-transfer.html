It serves as a link between the commercial marketplace and Tuskegee University faculty. TT offers Tuskegee University researchers expertise and guidance regarding the protection of intellectual property, including patents and copyrights, and in seeking licensing agreements with commercial entities to take Tuskegee University research developments into the marketplace for the public benefit. Technology Transfer is led by the Vice President, Research and Sponsored Programs. Tuskegee University Technology Transfer Process The Office of Technology Transfer aims for efficiency and expediency in handling your inventions and innovative new ideas. Below are the steps our office takes to help you begin the journey to protecting your intellectual property. Step 1 Research Step 2 File a Disclosure Step 3 Present your Invention Research activities often lead to discoveries and inventions. An invention is any useful process, machine, composition of matter, or any new or useful improvement of the same. File a Disclosure Form, immediately, if you believe your invention has the potential to be patent protected. IMPORTANT: It is critical to avoid public disclosure of your innovation before filing a patent application. Present your invention to the Intellectual Property Committee. During this presentation you will pitch your idea\/invention to the committee, attempting to convince them why TU should pursue patent protection. Step 4 Protection Step 5 Marketing Step 6 Selecting a Partner\/Business Start-up The patent attorney team will file your disclosure with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Inventors work directly with TU's outside patent attorneys. Your contacts may be very helpful as we contact potential licensees during the marketing process. Non-disclosure agreements are signed to interest company to review more detailed and unpublished data and information and to potentially visit your lab. Select a company that shows interest in the invention. If a new business start-up has been chosen as a commercialization path, OTT will assist in planning, creating and funding the start-up. Step 7 Licensing Step 8 Commercialization Step 9 Revenue A License agreement is a contract between TU and a third parry in which TU's rights to a technology are licensed (without relinquishing owernship) for financial and other consideration. Licensing is a team approach involving both OTT and the inventor(s). The licensee contnues the advancement of the technology, and makes other buisness investments to develop the product or service. Revenues recieved by TU are distributed to University and inventors to fund additional research and education and to encourage further participation in innovation.
