Handbook and Policies & Procedures 2021-2022 Nutrition & Dietetic Technician Student Handbook 2020-2021 Nutrition & Dietetic Technician Student Handbook Nutrition & Dietetic Technician Program Policies and Procedures Internship The Purpose of the Internship The purpose of the internship (supervised practice) is to provide students the opportunity to apply the knowledge they have learned throughout their course of study. The internship (supervised practice) is for educational purposes only and the intern\/student is not to be used to replace employees. The Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) requires completing an internship with a minimum of 450 hours of supervised practice; to ensure graduates will be competent entry-level Dietetic Technicians. ACEND is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics accrediting agency for education programs preparing students for careers as Registered Dietitian Nutritionists or Nutrition and Dietetic Technicians, Registered. Students are responsible for finding an Internship Preceptor and a Facility (to be approved by CAC) to complete their internship in the United States. Foundations of Dietetic Technician Internships (NTR 157) During the Foundations of Dietetic Technician Internships class, students will work with the CAC Instructor to complete paperwork needed to secure a facility and Internship Preceptor. An Affiliation Agreement between CAC and the facility where the student wants to complete their internship; must be completed during this class. Students will also need to complete and pass: background check, drug screening, immunizations, 2-Step TB skin test and any other requirements deemed necessary by their facility. Students will not be able to begin the internship if all requirements of the facility and CAC are not completed. NTR157 Preview \u2013 Part 1 of 2 NTR157 Preview \u2013 Part 2 of 2 Dietetic Technician Professional Practice Internship (NTR295) (1 Internship = 66 Hours \u2013 Supervised Practicum) Competencies required for the Dietetic Technician A.A.S. specifically in the areas of ethics, scope of practice, professional development, public policy legislation and communication. Dietetic Technician Internship (NTR 296) During the Dietetic Technician Internship the Internship Preceptor supervises a minimum of 384 hours. The ACEND-required Dietetic Technician competencies are demonstrated as the intern completes projects supervised by the Internship Preceptor and CAC Internship Instructor. Competencies can be described as a common understanding of the essential skills and knowledge that are regarded as necessary to work as an entry-level Nutrition and Dietetic Technician, Registered. The intent is that the individual should have the level of competence expected of someone prepared to begin a career as a dietetic technician. This includes: ，Scientific and Evidence Base of Practice: general understanding of scientific information and research related to the dietetic technician level of practice. ，Professional Practice Expectations: beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors for the dietetic technician. ，Clinical and Customer Services: development and delivery of information, products and services to individuals, groups and populations at the dietetic technician level of practice. ，Practice Management and Use of Resources: strategic application of principles of management and systems in the provision of services to individuals and organizations. ，Support Knowledge: knowledge underlying the requirements specified above. Internship Projects Directions\/Rubric Evaluation Three projects requiring a minimum of 450 hours of practice supervised by an Internship Preceptor must be completed in one semester (16 weeks). Your internship requires a lot of time to be successful with on-site internship hours and other class assignments. Interns typically are on-site 3 days\/24 hours per week. This does not include travel or homework time. Time management is critical to student success. Click on the links below to view the three internship projects (Directions\/Rubric Evaluation forms): ，Food Service and Management ，Education and Training ，Nutrition Care Process and Medical Nutrition Therapy The Internship Preceptor will provide guidance, mentoring and will be assessing the intern\u2019s competency level as they complete all of the projects. Both the Internship Instructor and the Internship Preceptor will evaluate the intern\u2019s projects and related assignments (refer to Direction\/Rubrics). If any competency is not met within the hours initially devoted to that project, the intern must continue to work on that competency until he or she can demonstrate competency at a minimum of entry level. In some cases, this may result in an intern\u2019s devoting more hours to the supervised practice component of the internship. The projects associated with the competencies are specified as in the Directions\/Rubric Evaluations forms. It is mandatory that students join the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics as a student member. Members of the Academy are automatically a members of their state Dietetic Association. Each state has local chapters and it is highly recommended that you join your local chapter of the Academy. This allows students opportunities to network with dietetic professionals before the start of Foundations of Dietetic Technician Internships (NTR 157).
