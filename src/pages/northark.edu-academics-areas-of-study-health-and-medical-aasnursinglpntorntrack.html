The curriculum in nursing is a full-time program, requiring a full-time commitment from its students. The faculty of the Department of Nursing strongly discourages its students from full-time or part-time employment. Students with financial difficulties should discuss alternatives to employment with the Financial Aid Office. Students in the RN Bridge program need a flexible schedule because clinical experience is held at area facilities during assigned hours which may be days or evenings. Because of this, transportation, child care and any employment should be considered prior to entry into the nursing program.
