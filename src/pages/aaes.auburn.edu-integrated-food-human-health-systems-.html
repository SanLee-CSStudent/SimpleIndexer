Interdisciplinary Teams Food safety, quality and integrated health (Team Leader: TBA) Rural economic and community development (Team Leader: TBA) Human nutrition and health (Team Leader: Ramesh Jeganathan) Food safety, quality and integrated health From producing quality crops and animals to transporting those products to buyers to ensuring that food is safe for human consumption, this team takes a \u201Cfarm-to-fork\u201D approach to research. Team members with expertise in water quality, consumer choices and food safety collaborate to find answers to agricultural questions. The team focuses on meat science and producing quality animal proteins. Some researchers are creating new, innovative foods and technologies. Others are identifying potential outside influences that could affect our food sources and then analyzing how to protect our food supply to continue to provide the most wholesome and widely available foods possible. \u201CI guess we\u2019re that link between all of the systems and how do we get that onto consumer plates.\u201D Rural economic & community development Human thought and behavior are central to agriculture, with farmers, consumers and lawmakers, for instance, making choices every day about what and how food is grown, processed, regulated, purchased, marketed and eaten. Rural sociologist Michelle Worosz, team leader, said the group\u2019sprojects are highly interdisciplinary and can include topics such as production costs and economics, risk analysis, food safety, governance and rural and community development. Team members include researchers in animal sciences and fisheries and Extension specialists who work directly with producers and consumers. Worosz is currently working on a research proposal looking at helping Alabama fish producers manage governance and resilience issues related to natural and man-made disasters. Another interdisciplinary project involves helping an agricultural producer community adopt technologies that will help them become more sustainable long term. Human nutrition & health This team\u2019s research on human health is important for the people of Alabama, a state that has one of the highest obesity rates in the U.S. Scientists in this group study how diet, nutrition and lifestyle are related to health problems such as diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease and investigate the connection between obesity and high blood pressure, cardiovascular complications, cancer and other health issues it contributes to. On one project, team members are studying how genetic and metabolic factors are related to obesity in schoolchildren of different ethnic groups. \u201CIs there anything with the genetic factor, or diet, or anything behavioral\u2014what time they go to bed, what time they get up, what kind of food they\u2019re eating, what time they\u2019re eating?\u201D said team leader and nutrition professor Ramesh Jeganathan. Other team members are researching the health benefits of the bioactive component resveratrol in red wine; the effects of greens, such as spinach, on cancer; and the Mediterranean diet. \u201COur mission is to improve human health through better nutrition,\u201D said Jeganathan. \u201CThat\u2019s the big picture.\u201D Contact AAES Directors Office 107 Comer Hall Auburn Univ., AL 36849 334-844-2345 Campus Map Website feedback Webmaster AAES Pages AAES Home About Us Research Centers & Institutes Faculty Resources American Recovery & Reinvestment Act Links Auburn University A-Z Index Accessibility AU Access Copyright People Finder Privacy Facebook Twitter RSS ?2020 Auburn University, Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station.
