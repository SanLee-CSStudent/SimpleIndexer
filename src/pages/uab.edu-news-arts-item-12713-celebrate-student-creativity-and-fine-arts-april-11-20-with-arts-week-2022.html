Spring is often framed as a time of new beginnings, says College of Arts and Sciences Dean Kecia M. Thomas, Ph.D.; but it is also when work done beneath the ground or behind the scenes comes to fruition, as plants emerge from the ground and new blossoms appear on the shrubs and trees. \u201CThe same is true for artists, they work together for long hours away from public view and ultimately emerge providing us with breathtaking beauty, sounds and sentiments,\u201D Thomas said. \u201CI hope you will join me in witnessing the new work that emerges from our Fine Arts programs as we celebrate our student artists.\u201D With this curated list of performances, the college invites students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members to attend and engage with the arts at UAB.
