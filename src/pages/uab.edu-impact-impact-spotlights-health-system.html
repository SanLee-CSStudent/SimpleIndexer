BIRMINGHAM CITY SCHOOLS HEALTH ACADEMY UAB Medicine offers Birmingham City Schools students many opportunities for learning and career development, focusing on the variety of jobs represented at the UAB Medicine. On behind-the-scenes tours, sophomores in the Health Sciences Academies at Carver and Jackson- Olin high schools get the chance to learn about the dozens of careers that make up UAB Medicine, from physicians and nurses to lab technicians, physical therapists, central sterile supply and environmental services. Juniors from the two schools are given opportunities to shadow these professions, while select seniors are selected for paid internships at UAB Medicine. The ultimate goal is for students to begin career planning in high school and to explore the breadth of jobs available in the health care industry so that they may bridge into training programs after high school in preparation for careers in health care. UAB Medicine also serves Birmingham City Schools as a host site for Project SEARCH \u2013 Birmingham. Project SEARCH is a unique school-to-work transition program for students with disabilities. Birmingham City Schools students participate in this one-year internship program during their last year of high school focused on providing competitive, transferable and marketable skills that prepare the intern to secure competitive employment at UAB Medicine or in the local community.
