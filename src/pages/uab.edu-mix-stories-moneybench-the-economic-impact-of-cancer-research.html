NSF award will boost UAB research in machine-learning-enabled plasma synthesis of novel materials The $20 million National Science Foundation award will help UAB and eight other Alabama-based universities build research infrastructure. UAB\u2019s share will be about $2 million. Novel preclinical drug could have potential to combat depression, brain injury and cognitive disorders The drug inhibits the kinase Cdk5, found in mature neurons. Cdk5 has long been implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions, but previous inhibitors have largely failed to reach the brain through the blood-brain barrier. A gene in tuberculosis bacteria is found essential for siderophore secretion and virulence This discovery validates siderophore secretion as a drug target in tuberculosis and reveals a new mechanism for putative drugs. Many tuberculosis bacteria are highly resistant to multiple antibiotics. Methylation of tRNA-derived fragments regulates gene-silencing activity in bladder cancer This novel mode of altering gene silencing boosts the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells, helping those cells survive during rapid growth. UAB\u2019s Casey Weaver elected to prestigious National Academy of Sciences For just the third time in history, a University of Alabama at Birmingham faculty member has been elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. A novel therapy ameliorates obesity and Type 2 diabetes in mice fed a high-fat diet This therapy, using sustained release of nitric oxide, may be a novel, efficient and safe way to prevent and treat multiple metabolic diseases. Vohra receives $540k grant from U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration A UAB physics professor has received a grant to synthesize novel materials for hypersonic applications and study their response under extreme conditions. A refined microbiome \u201Cfingerprint\u201D method tracks sub-strain variants of a single gut microbe strain An absence of sub-strain variation over a short period was seen in sick patients, which may signal impending gut dysbiosis. Cancer: Sialylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor modulates cell mechanics and enhances invasion This study included three lines of human cancer cells and suggests new potential therapeutic targets in cancer. UAB\u2019s Department of Radiation Oncology can now perform prostate HDR treatments on cancer patients UAB is the only site in the state of Alabama to perform brachytherapy treatment. A key brain region for substance use disorders now has a searchable atlas of distinct cell populations The distinct cell populations were identified by single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 21,600 cells of the rat ventral tegmental area, located in the midbrain. UAB joins international drug trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis The investigational drug masitinib appears to inhibit parts of the immune system that may be overactive in ALS. Genetic variation common among Black individuals is associated with higher risk of heart failure and death The UAB Cardiogenomics Clinic provides genetic testing and counseling for a gene variant associated with a risk of heart failure and death. How T cell-derived interleukin-22 promotes antibacterial defense of colonic crypts Researchers show how two types of immune cells \u2014 one a part of the innate immune system and the other a part of the adaptive immune system \u2014 play distinct and indispensable roles in the colon to defend against pathogenic bacteria. Arora receives $3.7 million grant to study precision treatment for high blood pressure UAB researchers analyze the role that natriuretic peptides play in high nighttime blood pressure. Researchers find that genetic scores may identify risk of heart disease for people with Type 2 diabetes This genetic risk score may help health care providers identify the risk of heart disease earlier and take preventive measures. Similar rates of COVID-related acute kidney injury found in early adolescents and older adults, study shows COVID-related acute kidney injury peaked in 10- to 15-year-olds and 70- to 75-year-olds, suggesting age is not the sole determinant in severity of illness from COVID-19. Heart disease: NIH grant to UAB will fund study of safer, more durable stents Researchers have been awarded a $2.6 million, four-year National Institutes of Health grant to evaluate a safer and more durable stent design, using techniques licensed through the UAB Harbert Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship by the UAB spinoff company Endomimetics LLC. Preclinical demonstration of a potent, universal coronavirus monoclonal antibody therapy for all COVID-19 variants The monoclonal antibody cocktail is deliverable via a nasal dose, and it is also effective against SARS, MERS and several coronavirus cold viruses. The antibodies are engineered for long-acting effectiveness, potentially lasting a year or more when used in humans. Reporting mental health records to national firearm background check system decreases suicide rates Reporting mental health records to national firearm background check system decreases suicide rates, according to research published by Collat School of Business professors. UAB launches new Neuroengineering and Brain-Computer Interface Initiative The fields of neuroengineering and brain-computer interfaces could have a tremendous impact on a number of neurologic conditions, such as stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson\u2019s disease, dementia and other brain diseases. New HIV mRNA vaccine study gets boost from COVID mRNA vaccine development Researchers hope to learn whether the immune system will respond to the experimental vaccines by making antibodies and T cells that could fight HIV if a person is ever exposed to the virus in the future. Black adults are at a higher risk of developing diabetes due to genetic variations and social health determinants, research shows Traditional markers of cardiometabolic health may be lower in Black individuals, but the development of diabetes is more common in those with African ancestry. An oral medication shows benefits treating Type 1 diabetes for at least two years after diagnosis Benefits of the blood pressure medication verapamil include delayed disease progression, lowered insulin requirements and preservation of some beta cell function. Study examines timing abilities of drivers with ADHD and ASD Student-led study shows that those with autism spectrum disorder present difficulties in time estimation abilities while driving. Majority of young adults and adolescents in the United States are using cannabis instead of nicotine, study shows More adolescents and young adults in the U.S. vape cannabis instead of nicotine, contradicting widely held beliefs of nicotine consumption in vaping. Miller awarded $3.09 million R01 to study drug targets for glioblastoma The grant will fund research surrounding next-generation human models that could potentially aid in the development of treatment for glioblastoma. 20-year analysis shows increase in in-hospital cardiac arrests despite advances in resuscitation medicine As overall in-hospital cardiac arrest rates rise, overall survival rates are improving in tandem. But researchers say there is still room for improvement.
