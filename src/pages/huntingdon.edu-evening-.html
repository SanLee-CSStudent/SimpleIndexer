Cameron West, President of the College Re: Evening Studies Program The Administration has decided to discontinue admitting students to the Huntingdon College Evening Studies Program on April 20, 2020. Any student admitted to the program on or before April 20, 2020 will be provided the opportunity to complete his or her degree. Huntingdon College is a College of the United Methodist Church, an outgrowth of the Methodist movement begun in 18th Century England by John and Charles Wesley. Since the mid-1700\u2019s, beginning with the Wesleys\u2019 establishment of schools for underserved populations, access to education has been a priority of the Methodist movement around the world. Huntingdon developed its Evening Studies Program almost 20 years ago as an extension of this historic Methodist mission. Designed as an alternative to online education, the Evening Studies Program has delivered program content in a one night per week, face to face format since 2002. Partnering first with Enterprise State Community College \u2014 then expanding to Coastal Alabama, Jefferson State, Southern Union, Bevill State, Northeast Alabama, and most recently Northwest-Shoals Community Colleges \u2014 Huntingdon has through its Evening Studies Program offered four-year degree content on the campuses of two-year colleges. Since the program\u2019s inception, Huntingdon has awarded over 750 bachelor\u2019s degrees to Evening Studies students, most of whom are working adults. This program has transformationally impacted countless individuals who otherwise would have had no realistic path to earning a four-year baccalaureate college degree. Their experience has, thereby, positively impacted their families, their employers and communities, and the State of Alabama. Despite this history, it has become increasingly clear to the Administration that the proliferation of online degree completion programs from other institutions has resulted in a clear trend of decreasing Evening Studies Program enrollment at most sites. The decision to discontinue the program has been made in order that the College may direct all of its resources to support emerging programs showing evidence of increasing demand and those core programs continuing to experience strong enrollment. \u2014 J.
