(April 11, 2022) - Lyon College announced it has begun developing plans for proposed veterinary and dental schools located in Little Rock, Ark. The schools will be part of the new Lyon College Institute of Health Sciences. The College\u2019s faculty assembly and Board of Trustees approved both proposals in March, and the proposals for academic changes were submitted to the College\u2019s regional accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), on Tuesday, March 15. Following consideration by HLC, the College will submit the prepared accreditation applications with both the American Veterinary Medical Association\u2019s Council on Education (COE) and the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). Pending the accreditors\u2019 approval, inaugural classes could start as early as 2024 or 2025. Lyon has identified several potential locations in Little Rock and should finalize the location for the campus soon. To ensure the success of the schools\u2019 openings, Lyon College has entered into a strategic collaboration with OneHealth Education Group (OneHealth). OneHealth utilizes private sector capital and consultant solutions to support the launch of professional health science programs. The group aims to reduce the debt burden of graduating professionals and to provide solutions for communities that lack ample access to healthcare. \u201CWe are excited to convene Lyon College, dental and veterinary leaders, and other funders together to create this opportunity,\u201D said Frazier Edwards, president of OneHealth. Last year, Arkansas ranked 51st in the country for dental health and is experiencing a dentist shortage. \u201CWith no in-state options, aspiring dental students in Arkansas are forced to pay out-of-state tuition, which is significantly greater than in-state tuition fees,\u201D said Andy Goodman, president of Arkansas\u2019 Independent Colleges & Universities. \u201COnce students migrate away from Arkansas for school, they are less likely to return, draining talent and energy from our state.\u201D Additionally, with only 14.3 veterinarians per 100,000 individuals, Arkansas ranks 49th in the country for its veterinarian-population ratio, and agriculture makes up nearly 15% of Arkansas's economy, with poultry, cattle, and equines accounting for the largest share of that. Demand is expected to increase sharply. A recent study predicts Americans will increase their spending on pet healthcare by 33% in the next decade, while the number of new veterinarians entering the profession each year increases by just 2.7% annually, falling short of the need for 40,000 new veterinarians in the United States by 2030. In an announcement to the Lyon College campus community, President Melissa Taverner said, \u201CLyon has a 150-year history of providing exceptional and relevant education to Arkansans and students of the region\u2026 These plans are part of a comprehensive, strategic set of initiatives, all borne out of our vision for Lyon and higher education in Arkansas, as we mark our sesquicentennial year.\u201D She continued, \u201COur strength in education, coupled with our partnership with OneHealth, creates a unique opportunity to meet an important need that affects every Arkansan.\u201D Earlier this year, the College also announced a collaboration with White River Medical Center (WRMC) in Batesville to develop an RN to BSN program. Taverner explained that these partnerships with WRMC and OneHealth are \"intentional efforts to continue providing excellent undergraduate education at our central campus in Batesville while also expanding to offer graduate and professional programs in Little Rock and beyond.\" OneHealth has partnered with the country\u2019s leading education consulting firms, the Academy of Advancing Leadership (AAL) and the Animal Policy Group, for guidance in developing the schools. The AAL is a health and higher education consulting firm assisting directly with the dental school development, and the Animal Policy Group works closely with the veterinary industry and schools in the United States and throughout the world to maximize their success. \u201CThe partnership between Lyon College and OneHealth will launch a community based and a distributive model of education and clinical care to meet the significant oral health needs of Arkansas,\u201D Dr. Karl Haden, president of AAL, said. \u201CAAL is pleased to contribute to the planning and initiation of the school.\u201D Lyon College Board Chair Perry Wilson described today\u2019s announcement as \u201Ca proud moment for Lyon College and the state of Arkansas.\u201D \u201CThis strategic initiative is consistent with the long-standing mission of Lyon College and will propel the economic growth of our state.\u201D Support the Lyon College Institute of Health Sciences by clicking here.
