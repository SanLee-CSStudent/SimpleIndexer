In keeping with the National Association of Colleges and Employers Career Readiness Competencies, we have identified a list of skills that we feel serve as the foundation for an overall culture of learning while working. We are intentional about creating jobs, internships and leadership opportunities where students can acquire skills that will translate into a future career. Students who work and lead in our offices and departments will participate in self-assessment as well as receive regular feedback as we track their growth and learning. We hope that after working in Student Affairs, students will be equipped with many of the following: Professionalism Professionalism includes, but is not limited to, the skills, judgement, and behavior that is expected from a leader or employee. It is evident through both the attitude and conduct of the professional. Practical Leadership & Management Practical Leadership & Management is the ability to develop an idea into a real-life action or action plan. This skill requires the ability to support others, delegate tasks, communicate goals, and critically understand the needs of others to create a balanced, fair, and performance-driven team environment. Cultural Humility & Global Fluency Cultural Humility & Global Fluency requires consideration and accommodation of the different qualities and values of other individuals. Leaders and employees that are skilled in this area make an effort to stay socially conscious of the various cultures and mindsets of their co-workers, peers, supervisees, and customers. Civic Identity & Commitment to Service Civic Identity & Commitment to Service is a skill developed by a productive, caring, and contributing member of the community who understands the \u201Cwhy\u201D of what they are doing to better their world. Critical Thinking & Problem Solving Critical Thinking & Problem Solving requires the ability to identify an issue, analyze it, and conceptualize an action plan. This skill requires a leader to use self-corrective thinking. Technology Proficiency in the use and navigation of technologies (hardware, software, social media platforms, etc.) to problem-solve, accomplish tasks and produce positive outcomes.
