Local Sourcing UAB Campus Dining has a commitment to source locally whenever possible. We work directly with The Common Market to connect with local farmers and bring their produce and goods to UAB. The Common Market is a nonprofit regional food distributor with a mission to connect communities with good food from sustainable family farms. They strive to improve food security, farm viability, and community and ecological health. Learn more about The Common Market and their farmer partners here. LeanPath @ UAB LeanPath is a supplier that helps UAB track and measure its food waste through the use of a food waste measurement tool. It is an automated food waste tracking system that is used at The Commons on the Green. The LeanPath program offers a unique learning opportunity to raise awareness about manageable steps that we can all take toward a more sustainable food system. We collect and weigh any pre-consumer waster, this is any food that we have control over from leftovers, overproduction, trimming, catering, ect. LeanPath automatically captures date, time, and estimated value of the waste and reports this data back to UAB Campus Dining. LeanPath\u2019s automated system goes far beyond what you can accomplish with pen and paper, providing the simplicity and detail you need to maximize waste reduction. A Better Tomorrow Starts Today!
