Program Directors keep their programs up to date with the changes in the industry by consulting an advisory board of local professionals currently employed in the industry. With over 30 programs, over 100 degrees and certificates, and hundreds of courses to choose from, offered both on campus and online, we have the right path to prepare you for your future. Credit for Industry Credentials For several of our programs, Mesa Community College offers Prior Learning Assessments (PLA) for students with existing industry certifications, licenses, or approved corporate training. With an approved PLA, you can receive credits at no cost for industry recognized credentials or a flat $40 administrative fee for corporate training. Explore Prior Learning Assessments AAS: Associate in Applied Science This degree is recommended for students who desire to gain a depth of technical expertise by completing a Career and Technical Education program. An AAS includes some general education courses. CCL: Certificate of Completion Certificates of Completion are in a broad range of programs for students desiring education beyond high school. These programs provide opportunities for students to prepare themselves for a wide variety of careers in businesses and industries. Generally credit hours to complete a certificate are less than an AAS and vary by program (from 4 to 39). All Available CTE Programs All students are urged to meet with an advisor before beginning a program to plan their course of study.
