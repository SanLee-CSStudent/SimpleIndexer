A second-year renewal may be available upon completion. \u201CPast Fellows have introduced running clubs, helped students build greater resiliency and coping skills, shared insights on overcoming imposter syndrome, hosted book clubs, meditation groups and various lectures,\u201D explains Kristine Hurst-Wajszczuk, DMA, associate dean in the Honors College and professor of voice in the Department of Music.
