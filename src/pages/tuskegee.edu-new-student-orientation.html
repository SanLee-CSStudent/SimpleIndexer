New Student Orientation Welcome to New Student Orientation (NSO) Virtual Orientation Dates: June 10, June 24, July 8, & July 22 Operation Move-In is the official start of the fall semester at Tuskegee University. It is an exciting time as we are looking forward to welcoming students and prepare to kick-off the academic year. The primary responsibility for general health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic is a shared responsibility. All students, families and guests are asked to comply with the policies, procedures and protocols designed to support the overall health and well-being of everyone in our university community. Protecting our most vulnerable populations (e.g., medically susceptible, non-traditional, older, and homeless students) is a moral and ethical obligation of the entire Tuskegee community. We\u2019re so excited that you have joined the Golden Tiger Family!! Due to the ongoing threat of COVID-19, Tuskegee University has decided to host our new and transfer orientation sessions through a virtual online experience. The University is committed to giving you the same personalized service that you would have received had you attended an orientation in person. Orientation programs are designed to welcome new students, parents, and families to the Tuskegee University community. We have carefully planned sessions to offer a range of perspectives on life at Tuskegee University, in addition to providing you with resources and information that will be helpful to students, parents, and families during the first year of your university experience. Classes begin Monday, August 22, 2022. For more info, call the Office of Student Life and Development at 334-727-8155 or e-mail orientation@tuskegee.edu, and we'll be glad to help you.
