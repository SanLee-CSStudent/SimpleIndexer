There are two resources that will help you determine which classes will transfer in: 1. The Huntingdon College Catalog. Use this resource to compare Huntingdon course descriptions with descriptions for courses completed at other colleges or universities to determine if the content is similar. 2. The Registrar\u2019s Office keeps a database of courses that have been evaluated from other colleges and universities. Note that if a course you\u2019ve taken isn\u2019t listed, that doesn\u2019t mean the course will not transfer to Huntingdon; your course may not have been evaluated previously by the Huntingdon Registrar\u2019s Office. Q: What courses from other colleges or universities will not transfer in? Transfer credit is not granted for courses that belong to one or more of the following categories: 1. Courses in professional, vocational, or sectarian religious study. 2. Courses below the level of introductory courses at Huntingdon College. 3. Courses that have not received a grade of \u201CD\u201D or better. 4. Courses completed while a student was not in good academic standing. 5. No credit is granted for general military training or attendance in service schools or training programs in the Armed Forces (unless such attendance is equivalent to a course offered at Huntingdon College). Q: What if I am not currently in good academic standing? A transfer student must be in good academic standing at all institutions attended previously. Transfer applicants under academic or disciplinary suspension or dismissal from a previous institution cannot be admitted to Huntingdon until such sanctions are lifted.
