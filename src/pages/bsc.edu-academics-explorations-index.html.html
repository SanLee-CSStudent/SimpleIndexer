You may have a strong idea where you want to end up. Or you may still be seeking. Either way, in today's changing world, there are many pathways to your goals. At BSC, we prepare students for lives of significance by providing a broad-based liberal arts education that prepares them for a lifetime of meaningful work. To that end, we\u2019ve designed a breakthrough general education program designed to give you the skills employers and professional schools seek. This curriculum is geared toward what you will be able to do when you graduate\u2014and the knowledge and experience you\u2019ll have to put those skills to good use. Our promise is that by graduation you\u2019ll be able to: Communicate effectively Solve problems creatively Engage in the community Connect your coursework to the wider world Engage in self-directed teaching and learning You will be guided in taking courses especially designed and approved by the faculty to achieve these outcomes. Those courses have the same rich disciplinary material in them expected of a nationally ranked liberal arts college; they are taught by the same talented faculty that BSC is known for. Plus, they highlight methods and assignments that assure that our graduates are ready to apply the knowledge that they gain in a complex, rapidly changing social and professional world. How do we know? A study by the American Association of Colleges and Universities identified several intellectual and practical skills highly desired by employers. Those skills were almost exactly the same ones listed by The Pre-Law Committee of the American Bar Association as key skills and values desired in those seeking admission in law school. There is also a demand for those who can work with numbers, especially statistics, and those who engage in public service. The Association of American Medical Colleges wants those interested in health related careers to know and be able to apply concepts in biology, chemistry, and physics, but they also want students to understand a variety of research methods and to be able to analyze a wide range of material in the behavioral and social sciences and in the humanities Am I on track?
