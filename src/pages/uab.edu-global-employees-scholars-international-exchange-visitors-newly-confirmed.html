Receiving your DS-2019 and booking a visa appointment After we receive the necessary documents, the ISSS office will generate a Form DS-2019 for you from the US government\u2019s SEVIS database and mail it to you via UPS or FedEx. You will need the original, blue-ink-signed Form DS-2019 with you to present during your interview with a US consular official before coming to the US. You can book a visa appointment even before your DS-2019 arrives in the mail by using the SEVIS number and the Program number that was included in your pre-arrival email. An overview of the visa process is available on the US Department of State website, but it is important to check specific instructions for the US Embassy\/Consulate where you will apply (visit your particular Embassy\/Consulate\u2019s website). You can also review the visa appointment times at various consulates. Here are the main steps: Pay the SEVIS Fee before your visa interview Review the\u202Fvisa appointment wait times\u202Fat various consulates. Complete the online Nonimmigrant Visa Application Form DS-160 (NOTE \u2013 The Department of State has a page for DS-160 Frequently Asked Questions) Pay the Visa Application fee and schedule your visa interview Prepare your interview and the supporting documents (NOTE \u2013 make sure you check the website of the Embassy or Consulate where you will apply to check the requested documents).

Canadian citizens will simply need to present the following documents to the Custom and Border Protection (CBP) agent at the port of entry: Valid passport \u2013 valid at least 6 months past the end date on the form Ds-2019 Valid DS-2019 Proof of required SEVIS fee payment Be sure to that the officer stamps your passport and indicates on the stamp \u201CJ-1\u201D and \u201CD\/S\u201D for Duration of Status under \u201Cadmit until date\u201D. After your entry, you will be able to retrieve your electronic arrival record I-94 (I-94 website). Be sure that the I-94 list your entry as \u201CJ-1\u201D with \u201CD\/S\u201D as the \u201Cadmit until date\u201D. If it is not the case, please contact ISSS at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. and send us copies of your passport, entry stamp and I-94. Attend your interview When you attend your interview, remember to be courteous and answer truthfully to any questions asked by the consular officer. Everyone who applies for a visa undergoes screening before the visa is issued, regardless of nationality. A consular officer will conduct an initial review of the application and interview the applicant about the planned activity in the US. Please provide clear and concise information about the field of study, teaching, research, or other activity at UAB. Be aware of the issues that may cause problems or delays in the visa application process: Inconsistent spelling of name on documents (passport, visa application, supporting documentation). Failure to read and follow the tips and guidance on the consulate\u2019s website. The consular officer cannot understand your purpose for being at UAB and therefore cannot assess the risk\/benefit of granting the visa. The applicant is from a country considered to pose a risk, or is working in a sensitive research field listed on the Technology Alert List (\u201CTAL\u201D). Someone else has the same or similar names as you. The consulate must rule out any incidents and resolve any \u201Chits\u201D the Consular Lookout (CLASS) system reveals on the name(s). After your interview, your application may be selected for an extra screening, called Administrative Processing. If you are subject to such procedure, the Consular Officer will inform you and give you specific instructions. Please follow the instructions and inform immediately the ISSS Office as well as your hosting Department at UAB. Administrative Processing can take between 4 to 6 weeks to be resolved, sometimes more. You will be able to check the status of your visa application online after your interview. Don\u2019t book your flight ticket before your visa is approved! Travel to the US We know that international travel is dehumanizing for everyone, but it can be especially frustrating and intimidating for non-US citizens. Please be honest, patient, and courteous with all US government officials, even if they are not so with you. You may experience: Delays in domestic and international flights due to heightened security measures. Fingerprinting and\/or digital photography taken upon entering the US. Inquiries and increased review of documents. Multiple inspections by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and\/or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials. Photocopying of documents by immigration officials and possible videotaping of interviews with CBP and\/or ICE officers. Inspection of personal belongings, luggage, pockets, or other items. CBP issued a new directive on the Border Search of Electronic Devices in January 2018. Please be aware that your phone, laptop, tablet, etc. may be seized and examined upon entry to the US.
