Enter Future Fit, a new workforce skills training program developed by the Arkansas Economic Development Commission (AEDC) along with business and industry leaders. Future Fit is a program that places qualified individuals directly into well-paying jobs throughout Arkansas, according to the (AEDC) website. Individuals leave with a certificate, badge, and their name in a SmartResume database utilized by employers designating them as trained and ready for hire. \u201CCreating industry-specific programs and working alongside business and industry to elevate the state\u2019s workforce is critical to ensuring our students have opportunities to work locally,\u201D Don Sugg, Northark interim president commented. The college was recently approved to receive $3M from the state towards the construction of an $8M Center for Robotics and Manufacturing Innovation to be located on the south campus. \u201CThe new building is part of a focused effort to aggressively expanded the manufacturing, robotics, and IT programs in response to the huge demand for workers in Harrison, our six-county service area and across the state. Future Fit adds another layer of credentials beneficial to students that sets them apart from job competitors while giving employers confidence in their hire and reducing their attrition.\u201D The program features 96-120 hours of basic skills training. The first class begins in August. Classes will be delivered in a hybrid format mix of in-person and online classes. The program is open to anyone who has a high school diploma or a GED, be an Arkansas resident or show proof of attending an in-state school, and one who desires to complete the curriculum and go to work. They should also have earned a Bronze level ACT National Career Readiness Certificate. Interested individuals can receive one free test for this certification at Northark.
