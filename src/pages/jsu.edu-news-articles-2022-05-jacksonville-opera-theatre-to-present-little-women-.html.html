Faculty Experts 05\/10\/2022 by Emily Duncan and Buffy Lockette It's a story that has been told countless times since its initial release as a coming-of-age novel in 1868 \u2013 spawning seven major motion pictures, numerous stage adaptations and several television series. Now, it's headed to Jacksonville State. The Jacksonville Opera Theatre will present the musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's \"Little Women\" on May 20-22 and 27-29, on campus in Mason Hall\u2019s Recital Hall, Room 351. This adaptation premiered in 2005 on Broadway featuring music by Jason Howland and lyrics by Mindi Dickstein. For the uninitiated, \u201CLittle Women\u201D is an American classic about four young sisters living in Concord, Mass., during the Civil War, and their passage from childhood to adulthood. This musical presents the familiar story of the March sisters at a crossroads in their journey. The musical captures the girls\u2019 tale, as young adults, with Meg wanting to settle down and start a family, Amy wanting to make her debut into society, Jo wishing to create adventures alongside her sisters and Beth supporting her sisters no matter which path they choose. \u201CIt\u2019s still the story many know and love, but audiences don\u2019t have to know Louisa May Alcott to see it,\u201D said Emily Duncan, show director and JSU career development coordinator. \u201CLike so many of us, Jo realizes that no one can tell your story better than you. Her story is the story she is meant to share, the memories, the world she fought to fortify, the world of the four March sisters captured forever. It's the story of strong women blazing their own paths that has resonated for generations. While some paths are expected, others are unexpected, and it is all \u2018astonishing.\u2019\u201D In addition to Duncan, the show is produced, designed and musically directed by Dr. Nathan Wight, director of operatic activities, and conducted by Dr. Jeremy Benson, associate professor of music. Chaney Billips serves as lead costume designer and Allison Woodward as choreographer. The cast includes: Esther Shull \u2013 Jo March Josh Guzman \u2013 Professor Bhaer Grace Anne Page \u2013 Young Amy March Mary Grace Hendley \u2013 Amy March Allison Carroll \u2013 Meg March Trinity Lane \u2013 Beth March Judy Shealy \u2013 Marmee March Silas Tankersley \u2013 Mr. Laurence Jared Stephens \u2013 Laurie Laurence Megan Brightwell \u2013 Aunt March Dylan Keasler \u2013 Mr. John Brooke Lauren Haygood \u2013 Mrs. Kirk and Hannah David Ritschard \u2013 Rodrigo Jamey Smith \u2013 Knight Erin Rose Pempel \u2013 Troll Megan Day \u2013 Clarissa Samantha Drake \u2013 Rodrigo 2 \"Playing Jo has been exciting and terrifying at the same time,\" said Esther Shull, a JSU film major. \"Having the opportunity to bring to life a character that I strongly relate to has taught me so much about myself. Jo\u2019s love for her family and determination to pursue her dreams without letting anyone deter her from getting there is beyond inspiring.\" JSU alumna Judy Shealy \u2013 who holds bachelor\u2019s degrees in voice and nursing from the university \u2013 stars as the March sisters\u2019 mother, Marmee. She said, \u201CLittle Women has been a favorite show of mine for a long time. I was very excited at the start of our rehearsals and during the process to see the story brought to life by such a talented group of students and community members. To me, \u2018Little Women\u2019 is a story about learning how to be happy and finding joy right where you are. Even in the quest to follow your dreams, it's important to notice and treasure the relationships with the family and community around you.\u201D Vocal music education major Silas Tankersley, who plays the March family\u2019s neighbor, Mr. Laurence, is in no way put off by performing in a women-center show. \u201CI have always loved the show, especially its music,\u201D he said. \u201CI think we have a great, hardworking cast, and I cannot wait to bring this production to life with them.\" The show will take place the last two weekends in May, from Friday to Sunday, May 20-22 and 27-29, with show times at 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and 2:30 p.m. matinees on Sunday. Tickets are $20 for adults and $15 for JSU students and audiences younger than age 18. Faculty and staff can get $5 off on opening night, May 20, by using the promo code \"FAC22.\" This offer expires at 12 a.m. on May 19. The run time is 2.5 hours, with a 15-minute intermission.
