Helena Little Theatre was organized in 1934 by a group of people who wished to offer live entertainment to the Helena and West Helena community and, at the same time, give themselves an outlet for their creative energies. The group has remained active for well over half a century, except for two brief periods in the late 1940s and early 1960s. In the early days only dramas, comedies, and mysteries were produced. That all changed, however, in 1968 when HLT produced its first musical, Kiss Me Kate, directed by Dr. Jean Knowlton. In 1973, My Fair Lady, directed by Eloise Kalb, was the first co-production of a musical by HLT and Phillips Community College. It was also the first such production staged in the new Lily Peter Auditorium. Since 1973, HLT and PCCUA have collaborated on numerous musicals and many dramas and comedies, including Annie, The Wizard of Oz, The King and I, South Pacific, Crimes of the Heart, Steel Magnolias, Greater Tuna, The Foreigner, Nunsense, Little Shop of Horrors, and most recently, Mary Poppins. Blending the resources and talent of HLT and PCCUA offers a perfect combination that will guarantee continued entertaining live theatre for Phillips County and surrounding areas in seasons to come. 2020 - 2021 Board of Directors Position Name President Kortni Carroll Vice President Debbie Hayes Secretary Karen Schwantz Treasurer Lanie Brandon Member Charlotte Wayman Member Rusty Porter Member Mary Ann Hargraves Member Katie Herrington Member Mandy Chaney Member Stephanie Cook Member Robert Murry Member Julia Staron Ex-Officio Kirk Whiteside Honorary Life - Deceased Eloise Kalb Honorary Life - Deceased Dr. Jean Knowlton Honorary Life - Deceased Miss Lily Peter Honorary Life - Deceased Pauline Smith Honorary Life - Deceased Dr. Gene Weber Honorary Life - Deceased Joyce Bell Home Employment University of Arkansas System Helpdesk Contact Accessibility Statement Website Design by: Younger Associates"}
