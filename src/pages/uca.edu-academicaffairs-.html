Poulter Provost and Executive Vice President, Academic Affairs The Division of Academic Affairs encompasses all things academic at the University of Central Arkansas. From the registrar\u2019s office to the library, from the gross anatomy labs to the digital film studios, from accounting to zoology, UCA\u2019s faculty and academic staff are proud of our rich educational traditions, our current vibrancy, and our aspirations for the future. Teaching, learning, and mentoring are hallmarks of the student experience at UCA for undergraduates and graduate students alike. We value academic excellence, professional distinction, and civic responsibility. We respect our localities and embrace a global vision. We believe in the university\u2019s mission to prepare students for meaningful careers, leadership roles, and life-long learning and to foster the same among ourselves.
