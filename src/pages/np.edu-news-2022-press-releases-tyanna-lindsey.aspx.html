School has always been a priority for Lindsey. Her future plans are to graduate from NPC, transfer to the University of Central Arkansas and pursue her degree in psychology. \u201CNPC has not only made me more confident in myself and my abilities, but it has helped me to build relationships around campus that I will carry with me throughout the rest of my life,\u201D said Lindsey.
