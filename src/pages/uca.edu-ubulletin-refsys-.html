The document has continued to evolve, however, and its referencing system requires another update. Beginning with the 2013-2014 annual issue, then, content within the Undergraduate Bulletin is properly referenced by (1) the issue year, (2) the page title (for example, this page\u2019s title is \u201CBulletin Reference Conventions\u201D) and, where relevant, section and subsection number. Explanation: Every page in the digital bulletin has a title. This title is displayed, when the file is opened in a browser, at the top of the page and, generally, in the browser\u2019s tab or page title space at the top of the browser window. Where appropriate, in addition, the bulletin\u2019s files have been divided into sections and subsections (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, etc.). Within the files, section headings look like this: [1] First-level heading [1.1] Second-level heading [1.1.1] Third-level heading A reference to the bulletin\u2019s description of the Academic Clemency policy would, then, for example, read something like this: UCA Undergraduate Bulletin, \u201CAcademic Records,\u201D ¡×9.
