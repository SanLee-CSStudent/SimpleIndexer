The University serves a diverse, student body from across the United States and around the world, although the primary constituency for students and financial support is the fellowship of the churches of Christ. The board of trustees, administration and faculty believe that the freedom to pursue truth and high academic achievement is compatible with the Christian principles to which the University is committed. The faculty is dedicated to excellence in teaching, scholarship and service, and to their role as models of Christian living. The University community seeks to provide an environment that both supports students and challenges them to realize their full potential. Thus, Harding's mission is to provide a quality education that will lead to an understanding and philosophy of life consistent with Christian ideals. This involves the following goals: Generally, the integration of faith, learning and living - developing the whole person through a commitment to Christ and to the Bible as the Word of God, an emphasis on lifelong intellectual growth, and the encouragement of Christian service and world missions through a servant-leadership lifestyle. Specifically, the development of Christian scholarship - while acknowledging dependence on God, stressing Christian commitment to intellectual excellence through a strong liberal arts foundation and effective professional preparation. The promotion of Christian ethics - creating an atmosphere that emphasizes integrity and purity of thought and action. The development of lasting relationships - fostering personal and social relationships through interaction among faculty, staff and students; and stressing a lifelong commitment to marriage and the Christian family. The promotion of wellness - emphasizing that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and that lifetime health habits contribute to a better quality of life. The promotion of citizenship within a global perspective - developing a Christian understanding of and respect for other cultures through an emphasis on liberty and justice.
