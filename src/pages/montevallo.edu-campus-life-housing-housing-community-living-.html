As an on-campus resident, you live in a community which is composed of many people with diverse backgrounds, interests, concerns, opinions, and standards. In order to make this kind of community livable, safe, enjoyable, and conducive to academic pursuits, a set of standards which defines what is acceptable behavior is necessary. It is important for all residents to be aware of and follow the policies established by the University, Housing & Residence Life, and the residents of the building. General Standards of Behavior The overriding goal of the residence life program is to develop communities within the residence halls which foster informal learning. The most crucial factor in this effort is the human element \u2013 responsible members of the community. As members of this community, students are given certain rights, privileges, and with these, responsibilities. Students residing in the residence hall setting will be living in a community that is composed of many people with diverse backgrounds, interests, concerns, opinions, and standards. In order to make this kind of community livable, enjoyable, and conducive to academic pursuits, a set of standards which defines what is and what is not acceptable behavior is necessary. Student\u2019s Responsibilities Students are responsible for knowing and abiding by all the policies of the residence hall system and the University of Montevallo. Students are expected to take an active role in monitoring behavior that occurs in the residence hall community. It is a student\u2019s responsibility to confront others who are violating hall policies and\/or to report such violations to the residence hall staff. Students are expected to cooperate with requests from staff members when they are acting in their official capacity within the University structure. A notification to see a staff member must be honored. Students are not to misrepresent or misuse their student identification or fail to show their student identification card upon the request of a staff member. It\u2019s All About Respect\u2026 Members of a University Residence Hall Community share certain goals, some of which include academic accomplishment, friendship, and a sense of belonging. While living on campus, it is essential that individuals respect the rights of their fellow residents, including the right to privacy, property, study, and rest, and have equal opportunity to share facilities common to all. Only by respecting others\u2019 rights can you expect to have your own rights respected. It follows then, that the spirit of on-campus life is one of mutual respect and cooperation, with each resident having the right and the obligation not only to be responsible but also to remind fellow residents of their responsibilities should their behavior depart from reasonable standards. The UM Residence Hall Handbook 2019-2020 (PDF) contains some guidelines and policies for community living. Residents are also bound by the University of Montevallo Student Conduct Code published in the student handbook The Fledgling, and by the laws of the State of Alabama. It would be impossible to outline every facet of residence life, therefore a spirit of common courtesy and respect for others should be maintained at all times. Commitment To Diversity The students and staff of the residence halls of the University of Montevallo are a multicultural community of individuals. They are of diverse racial, ethnic, class backgrounds, and national origins. Their views encompass a broad spectrum of religious and political beliefs, and their sexual orientations differ. They are unique in that they strive to work and live together, and in the process, learn from one another in an atmosphere of positive contact and mutual respect. All members are committed to behaving, and expect others to behave, in ways that demonstrate beliefs about the respectful treatment of each member of the community. All members of the community are individually and collectively responsible for their behavior and are fully accountable for their actions. Members should take initiative and responsibility for learning, and maintain an awareness of the differences that exist in the community in order to avoid actions that diminish others. Bigotry has no place within the community, nor does the right to denigrate another human being on the basis of age, physical challenge, national origin, sexual orientation, race, gender, or religious affiliation. Everyone who works and lives in the residence hall community must be committed to these principles which are an integral part of the community\u2019s purpose, values, and daily activities. Harassment Policy Housing & Residence Life will not tolerate verbal or written abuse, threats, intimidation, violence, or other forms of harassment against any member of the community. Incidents of harassment should be reported to residence hall staff and to the University Police. If you engage in harassment or physically assault another resident, your Housing assignment can be terminated. The University will not accept ignorance, anger, alcohol, or substance abuse as an excuse, reason or rationale for such behavior.
