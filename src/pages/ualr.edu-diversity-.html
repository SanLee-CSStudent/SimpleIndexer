Our goal is to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. We know that to respond to the needs of our campus and local communities, we must make DEI work a central component, integrated within the work we do to enhance our students, faculty, and staff experiences. Definitions are important and we must be committed to building and sustaining institutions of higher learning that embrace these core values. What is Diversity? Diversity: UA Little Rock is committed to increasing diversity. We understand that diversity and expressions of it take many shapes, which include race and ethnicity, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, language, culture, national origin, religious commitments, age, (dis) ability status and political affiliations. At its core diversity is acknowledging and affirming our unique and different expressions of humanity. What is Equity? Equity: UA Little Rock is committed to working actively to challenge and change systemic problems that have upheld values, policies, and actions that have created inequity for our students, faculty, and staff. We are committed to a policy of equal opportunity and will look for spaces and places to increase equity. What is Inclusion? Inclusion: UA Little Rock is committed to creating a more robust and inclusive campus and community environment. We understand that intentional and deliberate efforts are the only way to create a campus culture that embraces differences, different perspectives, different voices, and that historically marginalized persons\u2019 experiences are centered to enhance a sense of belonging. Authentic justice means we understand that inclusion is the goal and diversity and equity are how we meet the challenges it takes to get there.
