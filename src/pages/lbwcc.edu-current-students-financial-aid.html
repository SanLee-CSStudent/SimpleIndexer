Federal Financial Aid Federal Financial Aid Eligibility Requirements Federal Student Aid Programs available are Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), and Federal Work-Study (FWS). File a free application for Federal Student Aid at www.fafsa.gov, beginning October 1 of each year. Demonstrate financial need. Have a high school diploma, or a GED. Be enrolled as a regular student in an eligible program. Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen. Maintain satisfactory academic progress. Not be in default on Federal Perkins Loan (or National Direct Student Loan), Federal Stafford Loan (or Guaranteed Student Loan), Federal PLUS Loan or Supplemental Loan for Students (FSLS). Not owe a refund on a Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), or Alabama Student Assistant Grant (ASAP). Agree to use any Federal Student Aid received solely for educational purposes. If you are a male between the ages of 18 and 25, you must register with the Selective Service. Must not have a 4 year (Bachelor\u2019s) degree, Net Price Calculator The net price calculator will give you an estimated cost of tuition, fees, books and housing to attend Lurleen B. Wallace Community College, click on the link above to complete the calculation. Return of Title IV Policy In accordance with Federal regulations, those students who receive a disbursement of Title IV funds, Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, and\/or Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) officially withdraws or ceases attendance prior to the 60% point in the payment period, LBWCC will determine whether the student must repay a portion of the net disbursement. Federal Work-Study is excluded from the calculation. This process is called a Return of Title IV Calculation. Title IV funds must be disbursed within 14 days of the aid being posted on the students financial account, however aid is earned as student attends throughout the semester. If the student does not complete 60% of the semester, LBWCC is required to perform a calculation to determine if funds must be returned to the Department of Education. This date of withdrawal is determined in two different ways for official and unofficial withdrawals. Official Withdrawal The official withdrawal date is determined by the date the student started the withdrawal process or the date of the last academic related activity. Unofficial Withdrawal: The unofficial withdrawal date is determined by the date the instructors report as the last documented academic related activity when a grade of \u201CF\u201D is posted at the end of the semester or payment period. The return of funds calculation shall be based on the midpoint of the term for students who unofficially withdraw and cease attending before completing 60% of the term, unless it can be determined that the last documented academic related activity\/engagement is after the 50% date, at which time that date will be used to the benefit of the student. The percentage formula is as follows: total number of calendar days completed in the payment period divided by the total number of calendar days in the payment period equals the percentage of Title IV funds earned. Scheduled break days of 5 or more are excluded from the calculation. Funds shall be returned in the following order: Federal Pell Grants Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants FSEOG Any remaining credit, (post-withdrawal disbursements), shall be posted to the student\u2019s account within 45 days of the date it was determined that the student withdrew. If there is a remaining credit after all expenses are paid, the balance shall be refunded to the student within 14 days. Calculations and returns must be made 45 days from the date of determination for official withdrawals and 30 days from the end of the semester (or payment period) for unofficial withdrawals. The student may be required to return or repay the remaining unearned Title IV funds to the Department of Education. LBWCC will notify the student in writing of the amount they owe, the procedure for repayment and consequences of non-payment within 30 days. Any student who does not return or repay unearned Title IV funds as required by law will be reported to the Department of Education and will not be eligible to receive Title IV funds at LBWCC or any other college participating in the Title IV Program until overpayment is paid in full. LBWCC requires the student to repay any funds that the school was required to return to the Department of Ed as a result of the students\u2019 failure to complete 60% of the term. LBWCC will notify the student in writing informing them of the amount due to the school and why the amount is owed giving the student a day for the amount to be repaid. The student\u2019s account will be placed on hold and the student will not be able to register or receive an official transcript until said amount is paid in full. If the student owes LBWCC funds and fails to pay by the demanded date, their record will be turned over to Williams & Fudge, Inc. for collection, then if not paid will be sent to SSS Recovery for further collections. Calculation of Pell Grant Award Federal Pell Grant awards are based on full-time enrollment and will prorate for enrollment less than full time and enrollment in classes outside the declared major. For applicable certificate programs, the Federal Pell Grant disburses based on both credit and contact hours. For more information on how aid is awarded for a specific certificate program, please contact the financial aid office. The financial aid award may be reduced if the student does not begin attending classes, withdraws from classes or enrolls in courses not required for the declared major. Attendance will be verified by the instructor and students will be dropped for non-attendance. Students may be obligated to repay the difference between the funds awarded and the amount recalculated. Students who completely withdraw before the 60% point of the semester may owe a repayment to the U.S. Department of Education. Also, reducing the enrollment status may affect the required standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) and cause the student to lose eligibility to receive additional financial aid. It is recommended that students check with Financial Aid before dropping any classes or changing their schedule to determine how those changes may affect financial aid. Refer to the Lurleen B. Wallace Community College Catalog or visit the Financial Aid Office for more information. The Financial Aid Office reserves the right to amend or cancel awards due to changes in academic status, remaining need or funding a student receives by Lurleen B. Wallace Community College or another organization.

Please respond immediately to all LBWCC requests for additional information. Federal Verification of FAFSA Application: The Department of Education selects some FAFSA applications for a process called verification. During verification, the financial aid administrator(s) will ask the applicant to supply copies of documentation, such as income tax returns, W-2 statements and 1099 forms, to verify the data that was submitted on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). If your application is selected, you will be notified by email to review your myLBWCC(OneACCS) Account for the requirements necessary to complete verifications. If verification is not complete, your application cannot be processed. Some financial aid funds are limited and preference is given to students who apply by March 1. If you require a Pell Grant to pay your tuition and fees, your admission and financial aid files must be complete and received by the Student Services Department at least two weeks prior to registration. All high school and college transcripts must be on file before you can be awarded financial aid. Once your financial aid is completed by the financial aid office you will receive an award letter in yours SAINTS MAIL account.

To continue to receive aid you must apply for the FAFSA each year at www.fafsa.ed.gov and continue to make satisfactory academic progress. The FAFSA application opens each year on October 1. Satisfactory Academic Progress Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy beginning Fall 2021 Federal regulations require that all students receiving federal financial aid (Federal Pell Grant, Federal Work Study, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, or Alabama Student Assistance Programs) must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of a degree or certificate. Academic progress must be monitored for all terms of enrollment, whether or not financial aid was received. A student\u2019s academic progress will be evaluated at the end of each semester. Notices will be sent to students via email if they are placed on Financial Aid Warning or Financial Aid Suspension. The student may also review their eligibility online in their myLBWCC(OneACCS) account at any time. According to 34 CFR 668-16(e), there are two major components of satisfactory academic progress: the qualitative component (cumulative in-program GPA) and the quantitative component (timeframe of completion). Qualitative Requirement (GPA): Financial aid recipients must maintain the following grade point averages (GPA) according to the number of hours attempted. This includes all hours attempted at LBWCC, whether or not financial aid was received or courses were successfully completed. Also, grades for developmental courses, and periods when academic bankruptcy was applied shall be factored into the GPA calculation. Incomplete courses: Grades of \u201CI\u201D shall not be calculated into the the GPA. Grades of \u201CW\u201D shall not be calculated into the GPA. Repeated courses: The first repeat shall not be factored into the GPA calculation; however, all additional attempts shall be factored into the GPA calculation. GPA is only calculated using coursework taken at LBWCC. GPA requirements for long-term certificate and degree seeking students If the student has attempted 0-21 hours, they must maintain a 1.5 GPA. If the student has attempted 22-32 hours, they must maintain a 1.75 GPA. If the student has attempted 33 or more hours, they must maintain a 2.0 GPA. GPA requirements for short-term certificate (24-29 credit hours) students If the student has attempted 0-12 hours, they must maintain a 1.5 GPA. If the student has attempted 13 or more hours, they must maintain a 2.0 GPA. Quantitative \u2013 Pace of Progression Requirement (PACE): All credit hours attempted by the student will be calculated in the completion rate, which includes: transfer courses accepted by the institution, developmental coursework, incompletes, periods when academic bankruptcy was applied, and forgiven courses. Completion rate (attempted class hours) required by long-term certificate and degree-seeking students If the student has attempted 0-21 hours, they must maintain a 58% completion rate. If the student has attempted 22-32 hours, they must maintain a 62% completion rate. If the student has attempted 33 or more hours, they must maintain a 67% completion rate. Completion rate (attempted class hours) required by short-term certificate (24-29 credit hours) students If the student has attempted 0-12 hours, they must maintain a 58% completion rate. If the student has attempted 13 or more hours, they must maintain a 67% completion rate. Quantitative \u2013 Maximum Timeframe (MAX): The maximum timeframe for the completion of an undergraduate degree program is defined as no more than 150 percent of the normal timeframe required to complete the degree program. Example: For a degree programs that require 64 credit hours to graduate, maximum timeframe is 96 attempted credit hours. LBWCC programs are as follows: Program of Study Normal Length of Programin Credit Hours Maximum # ofCredit Hours Associate in Arts Degree Associate in Science Degree Air Conditioning & Refrigeration Certificate Automotive Mechanics Certificate Child Development Certificate Child Development Degree Computer Science Degree Cosmetology Certificate Diagnostic Medical Sonography Degree Diagnostic Medical Sonography Vascular Certificate Diesel and Heavy Equipment Mechanic Degree Diesel and Heavy Equipment Mechanics Certificate Emergency Medical Services Degree Esthetics Technology Certificate Forest Technology Degree Industrial Electronics Degree \u2013 Industrial Systems Option Industrial Electronics Degree \u2013 ACR & Refrigeration Industrial Electronics Degree \u2013 Electromechanical Option Industrial Electronics Nail Technology Associate Degree Nursing (Track 1) Associate Degree Nursing (Track 2 Mobility) Office Administration Degree Physical Therapy Assistant Degree Welding Certificate Welding Short Certificate Developmental Courses: A federal financial aid recipient may not receive aid for more than 30 semester hours of developmental course work. Transfer Courses: All transfer credits accepted by the college will count toward the PACE and maximum timeframe calculation. Should transcripts be evaluated and accepted credits after financial aid has been processed, the accepted credits will be evaluated at the next evaluation point. Repeat Courses: A student who has subsequently passed a course with a grade of A, B, C, or D shall be allowed to receive financial aid to repeat that course one time. If a student repeats a course that they have successfully completed, they will only receive credit for one class toward the total number of hours completed, and such a repeat will affect the completion rate. Failing grades, withdrawals, incompletes and\/or repeated classes may result in suspension of financial aid because these classes are considered as attempted hours not successfully completed. (These hours are included in the maximum timeframe calculation.) Financial Aid Warning: Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each semester. If the student is not making academic progress, notices will be sent to their Saints\u2019 email that they are placed on Financial Aid Warning and they are in jeopardy of losing financial aid eligibility. The student may also review their eligibility online in their myLBWCC(OneACCS) account at any time. If a student fails to meet the Qualitative Standard \u2013 Grade Point Average (GPA) and\/or the Quantitative Standard \u2013 Pace of Progression (PACE) for Satisfactory Academic Progress, they will be placed on a one-semester warning. Financial Aid Suspension: Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each semester. If the student has been placed on Financial Aid Warning and is not making academic progress for a second semester, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. Notices of the suspension will be sent to their Saints\u2019 email. This notice shall include how the student may regain eligibility. The student may also review their eligibility online in their myLBWCC(OneACCS) account at any time. The student will be placed on Failing SAP Status when the Qualitative Requirement - Grade Point Average (GPA) and\/or the Quantitative Requirement - Completion Rate (PACE) have not been met. There is no warning semester for Maximum Timeframe (MAX). If a student is academically suspended and readmitted on an admissions appeal, this does not automatically qualify a student for reinstatement of financial aid.Financial aid will be reinstated when the student attends college at his\/her own expense and meets the minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress or if the Financial Aid Appeal Committee reinstates eligibility. Change in Program: A change of program of study is allowed. However, all credit hours attempted, including transfer credits, attempted by the student in their previous programs will be included in the maximum timeframe calculation. A student may only receive aid up to 150% of the normal timeframe of the new program of study. If a student has reached the maximum timeframe for their new program of study, they may file an appeal for additional hours due to mitigating circumstances. If a student has previously earned a degree or certificate and wishes to purse another program, the student may complete a Request for Additional Program and submit it to the financial aid office for review. See the appeals process below. Lifetime Maximum: Students may receive Pell Grant for up to 6 full years, 12 full semesters, for a total of 600% Lifetime Eligibility Used, as determined by the Department of Education. Once a student has received a Pell Grant for lifetime maximum of 600%, they will no longer be eligible for additional Pell Grants. Appeals Process: If a student wishes to request consideration for re-instatement of federal financial aid due to mitigating circumstances, the student must complete a Financial Aid Appeal form and provide appropriate documentation. A written explanation regarding the mitigating and\/or extenuating circumstances, plan for improvement, academic plan signed off by an advisor, and supporting documentation must be included with the Financial Aid Appeal form. The student should explain what happened when the student previously attended LBW to prevent them from making academic progress and what has changed in the student\u2019s situation to allow them to meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements at the next evaluation. The appeal form and supporting documentation must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office, to be reviewed by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee as soon as possible, but no later than 10 days before the first day of class. The student will be notified by email of the decision by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. The decision of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee is final and is determined on a case by case basis. Students re-instated on Financial Aid Appeal will be required to follow an academic plan and if eligible, must contact the Director of Student Success within the time frame given by the appeals committee. Students must comply with all requirements and recommendations. Documentation will be provided by the Director of Student Success to the Financial Aid Office before the Financial Aid Probation will be removed.

Applications are processed by last name: A-K - sburke@lbwcc.edu L-Z - rbozeman@lbwcc.edu Quick Facts Pell Grant Students must be enrolled full-time (12 credit hours) to receive the maximum federal financial Aid. If students are enrolled less-than full-time then their Pell Grant is prorated accordingly and\/or may be cancelled. Pell Grant will not pay for courses not required by the program of study\/major. Most students are awarded Pell Grant for a total of two full-time semesters per year. If a student is awarded based on a financial appeal, he or she will be awarded for one term and shall be on financial aid probation. Students may now received Pell year round. However, in order to receive Pell for the summer term, if they have attended full-time Fall and Spring terms, they will be required to be registered in at least 6 credit hours. Pell Grant will pay for repeated courses which the student has received a passing grade of A, B, C, D one time. If a student receives a grade of F or W, the Pell Grant will pay until the student passes the class or is no longer making satisfactory academic progress.

If I have remaining funds after my tuition and fees are paid, how do I receive this balance? Financial aid awards exceeding tuition, fees and other allowable charges will disburse via direct deposit to the account listed in the student\u2019s account or by postal mail to the address on file in the Admissions and Records Office. Credit-balance refunds will be processed approximately two weeks after the registration period ends. 10. How are Federal Pell Grants awarded?

For applicable certificate programs, the Federal Pell Grant disburses based on both credit and contact hours. The financial aid award may be reduced if the student does not begin attending classes, withdraws from classes or enrolls in courses not required for the declared major. Students may be obligated to repay the difference between the funds awarded and the amount recalculated. 11. How does withdrawing from one or more classes effect my financial aid? Students who completely withdraw before the 60% point of the semester may owe a repayment to the U.S. Department of Education. Also, reducing the enrollment status may affect the required standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) and cause the student to lose eligibility to receive additional financial aid. It is recommended that students check with Financial Aid before dropping any classes or changing their schedule to determine how those changes may affect financial aid. Refer to the Federal Finanical Aid and Satisfactory Academic Progress links, Lurleen B. Wallace Community College Catalog or visit the Financial Aid Office for more information.

If you haven't received a Student Aid Report (SAR), call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (toll free) or 1-319-337-5665.

If it is submitted and you have not heard for the financial aid office within a reasonable amount of time, you should contact the finanical aid office listed below based on the first letter of your last name. Greenville Campus - A-K - sburke@lbwcc.edu MacArthur Campus - L-Z - rbozeman@lbwcc.edu 5. I was born on January 1, when I will be 24 years old. Can I check Yes in the answer to the FAFSA question \"Were you born before January 1, ...\" to qualify as an independent student? The official answer is no. If you check yes, your SAR will be flagged for verification. However, most financial aid administrators would use professional judgment to override the default dependency determination for a student born on January 1 who also demonstrates financial self-sufficiency. Home-Schooling and Financial Aid 1. Are there any programs that provide student financial assistance to home-schooled children? Home-schooled students are eligible for federal student aid for college if they have \"completed a secondary school education in a home school setting that is treated as a home-school or private school under State law\" (Section 484(d)(3) of the Higher Education Act of 1965). Home-schooled students have not been required to take the GED since the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. High school dropouts must take a GED exam, but students who have completed a home schooled secondary education that satisfies the requirements of state law do not. For additional information, see Federal Requirements for Home-schoolers Seeking College Admission and Financial Aid, Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), May 2003. There are not many scholarships specifically targeted at home-schooled students, other than those sponsored by the Home School Foundation. However, home schooled students may apply for LBWCC Institutional Scholarships by clicking on Scholarships. Timeline OCTOBER - DECEMBER Start a financial aid folder to keep all of your financial aid documents and information organized. Be sure to keep this folder throughout your years in college. Much of the information will be needed in subsequent years. Begin searching for private scholarships. Information on outside scholarships are often available from high school guidance counselors. You can also use one or more of the free on-line scholarships searches mentioned earlier in this brochure. Complete the FAFSA on the Web beginning October 1 each year. You will need a FSA User ID and Password to sign your application. A FSA User ID and Password are needed to access your account with the U.S. Department of Education and it serves as your electronic signature. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will also need a FSA User ID and Password to sign the application. For more information, go to https:\/\/studentaid.gov\/h\/apply-for-aid\/fafsa. This will determine your eligibility for financial assistance. You may list up to 10 colleges and all the schools you list will automatically receive your financial aid information. After filing the FAFSA, you will receive the Student Aid Report (SAR), which summarizes the information you provided and specifies a dollar amount for your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Be sure to read this report thoroughly and submit any necessary corrections. This must be completed before you will be considered for federal and state aid.
