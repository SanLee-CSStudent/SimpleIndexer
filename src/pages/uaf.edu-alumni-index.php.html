We started by asking our stakeholders to tell us what is working and what needs some attention. We applied the balanced scorecard approach to build a plan that we can refer to every time we make a decision about our work. Special thanks to Jim Williams, who led us through the process. This document will be updated regularly. Tell us what you think! uaf-alumni@alaska.edu. View the 2021-2025 UAFAA Strategic Plan ¡¿ Welcome to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Alumni Association.
