The university educates the next generation workforce, cultivates life-changing research, and develops new blueprints and missions for individuals, hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and government institutions that together, impact health and healthcare. ASU forges a new path in an area previously dominated by those with medical schools. For a decade, the university has been implementing a strategic plan to recruit world-class medical researchers and health policy analysts, forge networks and working alliances with institutions regionally and globally, and transform \u201Csiloed\u201D departments into new transdisciplinary schools and initiatives. It is extraordinary that a university without a medical school is playing a leading role in solving health problems and disrupting broken systems. But it is precisely because of this that ASU remains nimble and entrepreneurial, forging clinical partnerships with leading providers, while convening thought leaders to explore new approaches. Nothing is more illustrative of the New American University\u2019s design aspirations of use-inspired research and societal transformation than changing the dialogue around wellness from lifespan to the notion of \"health span.\" For the people of Arizona, across the nation and globally, ASU leads with an entrepreneurial spirit and the intention to make good health and quality healthcare attainable for all.
