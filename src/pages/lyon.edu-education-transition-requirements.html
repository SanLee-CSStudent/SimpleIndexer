Transition One: Pre-Admission Students wishing to begin the junior-level practicum sequence must provide documentation of a 2.75 cumulative GPA from Lyon or a transfer institution prior to enrolling in Practicum I. Students who do not have the requisite GPA must get permission from the instructor and the Director of Teacher Education in order to enroll in a practicum course. Practicum students should declare a major in Education upon enrolling in Practicum I. Transition Two: Admission to Internship Candidates for the student teaching internship must apply for admission during the semester immediately preceding the proposed placement. Candidates will be required to submit evidence of their preparedness for the internship and to sit for an interview with members of LATEC (Liberal Arts Teacher Education Committee) following submission of the required documentation. The following materials must be submitted electronically prior to the interview for admission: Candidate Information Form Names and email addresses of at least three references, one of whom must be the major advisor or another faculty member in the major discipline Philosophy of education statement or a typed statement explaining why you want to be a teacher Lyon transcript documenting at least a 2.9 cumulative GPA as well as a grade of \u201CC\u201D or higher in the following courses: ENG 102 English Composition II MTH 101 College Algebra OR MTH 105 Math for the Liberal Arts EDU 202 Overview of Teaching EDU 325 Practicum I Exam scores on the Praxis Content Knowledge Assessment in your chosen teaching field Formal observation evaluations from Practicum II PLEASE NOTE: Transferred credits will not be included in the GPA calculation for admission to the student teaching internship. Students who do not meet the cumulative GPA requirement of 2.9 or the course grade requirements will not be admitted but may submit a written request to the Director of Teacher Education for reconsideration of admission upon meeting the requirements. Transition Three: Exit from the Program\/Internship Portfolio Students maintain a digital portfolio documenting their progress in the program beginning with EDU 202. The completed portfolio is submitted in the last semester of the senior year for review and final grading. The portfolio must be submitted electronically and must include a capstone narrative and selected artifacts from the education coursework. Candidates are provided with a checklist and rubric to aid them in preparing their portfolios for submission. All digital portfolios will be archived by Lyon in an electronic format. More information about the portfolio can be found in the Lyon College Teacher Education Handbook. Students who meet these criteria and are in good standing will have completed the Liberal Arts Teacher Education Program, and the Arkansas Department of Education will recommend them for licensure. Candidates should be aware that the Arkansas Department of Education has access to and must consider any background check reflecting a conviction (pleading guilty or no contest or being found guilty by a jury or judge) for any offense listed in AR Code Ann. 6-17-410 as well as any felony involving physical or sexual injury, mistreatment, or abuse against another, including records that have been expunged, sealed, or subject to a pardon. The discovery of a record of conviction for any felony\/ non-felony offense could result in the applicant being ineligible for an Arkansas educator\u2019s license.
