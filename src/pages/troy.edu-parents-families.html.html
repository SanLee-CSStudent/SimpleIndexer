LEARN MORE Frequently Asked Questions What is FERPA and how do I comply? The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that affords parents the right to have access to their children\u2019s education records, the right to seek to have the records amended, and the right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education records. When a student turns 18 years old, or enters a postsecondary institution at any age, the rights under FERPA transfer from the parents to the student (\u201Celigible student\u201D). The FERPA statute is found at 20 U.S.C. ¡× 1232g and the FERPA regulations are found at 34 CFR Part 99. (Source) Make sure to review the Release of Student Information.
