View the Policy Gender Inclusive Housing Accordion Closed Gender Inclusive Housing (GIH) was established in 2012 with the explicit goal of helping transgender, gender-variant, and questioning students experience a greater sense of safety and belonging while living on campus. GIH provides a supportive and inclusive living environment where a student can room with any other student regardless of sex, gender, gender identity\/expression, or sexual orientation. The intended purpose of the program is to provide a living option for students who do not feel comfortable in gender-binary housing options. Priority is given to transgender and gender-variant students. GIH rooms are clustered together as micro-communities within the larger hall community. More information regarding locations, the application process, and roommate selection can be found through the Office of Housing and Residence Life.
