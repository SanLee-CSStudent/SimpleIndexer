Anthropology has often been called the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities. This means that anthropologists learn how to think critically and systematically while also learning how to interpret subjective phenomena. Student Spotlight Here's what current student Trinity Ingram has to say about her path to Anthropology and her work here at Lyon: \"Towards the end of high school, I realized that I loved studying different cultures and how said cultures interact. I wanted to do this in college, but I didn't know what major would support that at all. I went on the CollegeBoard website and found that, according to classes I loved, anthropology would be the best major for me. I knew nothing about anthropology beforehand; I researched the field, along with the sub-fields, and felt amazed. I didn't realize that it was such a diverse field! I fell in love and decided that I would study anthropology for my undergraduate career. Taking my first anthropology courses as a freshman only encouraged this.\" \"The anthropology classes here are small and intensive, truly allowing students to understand the material. Anthropology courses are perfect for a liberal arts school, as it is truly an interdisciplinary field. I've even gained an understanding of my other courses by just being an anthropology major. It's an intimate department that's welcoming of anyone who wishes to explore the social sciences.\" Graduate Programs Alumni are also continuing their education in graduate programs such as: Medical Anthropology at Durham University (United Kingdom) Biological Anthropology at University of Arkansas French at Louisiana State University Physical Therapy and Mental Health Counseling at the University of Central Arkansas For more information on the required courses for an Anthropology major or minor, view our courses page.
