The area is monitored by security cameras and panic alarms are placed throughout to be used to notify the UAMS Police in an emergency. Entry After regular Libary business hours when the Library service desk is closed or on holidays, students enter the after hours area on the 1st floor through the badge tap entrance on the 1st floor between the ED II and Rahn buildings. If a badge does not open the door call the UAMS Police (686-7777) for immediate entry with proper identification Safety and Security for the After-hours areas: Maintaining the safety of students and residents using the after-hours study space is our highest priority. Therefore, it is vital and imperative that everyone follow these important guidelines: Everyone must: swipe their current and valid UAMS ID badge at the Circulation Desk to remain in the after-hours areas at Library closing swipe their current and valid UAMS ID badge as they enter the area from the North Lobby and shut the door behind themselves immediately take their badges with them to the restroom (or any time that they leave the area) as they will need to swipe them to get back in (there are restrooms in the ED II North Lobby on the 1st floor) watch out for their own property use the panic buttons to summon immediate police response if necessary For safety reasons, do not: open the door from inside the room to let anyone in bring guests, friends, family members into the study area hold the door open for others to enter behind you---each person must swipe in to enter the room prop the door open (the Police Dept. is notified and will respond if the door is open for more than 30 seconds) IMPORTANT NOTICE: The safety of all who use the after-hours areas is our paramount concern. Failing to follow these safety points jeopardizes the safety of everyone in the after-hours areas. Students and residents failing to follow these guidelines will be reported to college deans. Individuals who are not current and active UAMS students or residents are not permitted to be in the after-hours area when the Library is closed. This includes family members, spouses, children, and\/or friends. There are no exceptions. << Previous: Library Computers and Computer Use Next: Fines on Overdue Materials >> : May 26, 2022 2:31 PM URL: https:\/\/libguides.uams.edu\/library-policies Print Page Login to LibApps Tags: cell phone use in the library, children in the library, computer use policies, fines and overdues, library conduct, library policies, privacy disclaimer Page Title University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Connect with us: Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube LinkedIn Pinterest Disclaimer Jobs Copyright Statement Privacy Terms ? 2017 University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences | Little Rock, AR"}
