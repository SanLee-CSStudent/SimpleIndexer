Vice president for administration, Kelli Embry presented the fiscal year 2023 annual budget which the board adopted unanimously. Embry explained the College uses an integrated process for budget and strategic planning so that budget requests are aligned with the campus\u2019 strategic priorities and high priority objectives. The process focuses on student success, academic quality, workforce preparation and administrative efficiencies. \u201CDuring the budget process we focus planning for the future while maintaining the fiscally conservative stance that the Board of Trustees expects. This tenet has allowed us to engage in big initiatives like automation and program expansion but also increase our reserves to ensure that we can endure tough times,\u201D said Embry. The proposed budget includes a $10 increase for tuition and a $5 increase for mandatory fees, bringing in-district tuition and fees to $100 per credit hour and $50 per credit hour respectively. The College has not requested an increase in tuition or fees for the past two years. \u201CThis is a fiscally conservative budget that focuses on the needs of our students, but also provides resources needed for our campus and employees,\u201D said Embry. She noted this year\u2019s budget prioritizes employee engagement and retention; investments in faculty, transfer and four-year degree opportunities; enrollment growth, retention and completion; scholarships; investments in apprenticeship and workforce development initiatives; campus wide technology and automation projects; and health, safety and security. \u201CThe budget managers and President\u2019s Cabinet have done a tremendous job looking for opportunities to cut costs while not sacrificing services to our students,\u201D she added. NPC President, Dr. John Hogan said, \"I appreciate the effort and teamwork that goes into planning our annual budget. We never want to increase tuition, but the cost of operations has increased across the board due to our current economy. This will be our first increase since 2019. However, we are in a good position because we follow good fiscal fundamentals that allow us to serve our students efficiently with quality services. Our finances are stable and that is largely due to the conservative oversight of this board.\" Related Posts NPC Announces Spring Dean's, President's ListLakewood Healthcare Endows Scholarships For NPC Nursing ProgramsTyanna Lindsey Named NPC Academic All-Star Helpful Links About NPC Academics Admissions Financial Aid Student Services Campus Map Staff Directory Employment Opportunities Report a Problem National Park College 101 College Drive Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas 71913 (501) 760-4222 Toll free number: 1-844-806-8752 Accredited by the Higher Learning Commission Accessibility Privacy Policy NPC ? 2022 National Park College, All Rights Reserved. ?"}
