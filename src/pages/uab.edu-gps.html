Students are able to view the satisfied requirements \u2013 as well as those not yet satisfied \u2013 for their degrees. Students can also view their remaining coursework if they change to different majors, and they may also use several GPA calculators. While the GPS is designed for work for as many students as possible, some students may see a message that an audit is not currently available for them. These students should review degree requirements with their academic advisor. If you have questions about your GPS information, please contact your academic advisor. While in GPS, you may click the \"Help\" button at the top of the page for your advisor's contact information.
