Vision Vision We believe in the value of relationships, and that all people should have the opportunity to be healthy, happy, and abuse-free. We are here to facilitate that opportunity, and help our clients achieve the goals that they set forth for their relationships. We believe in the agency of our clients, and with support and encouragement, great changes are possible. Mission Mission Relationships are everything. They cut across every area of your life - your family, your work, your friendships, and what you do for fun and recreation. Healthy relationships are the source of real joy and satisfaction in our lives. Sometimes things go wrong in relationships, but that does not mean there is not a way forward. We are here to help you nurture the very best relationships possible and be your best in those relationships. We are here to help you when relationships seem to go wrong - to help you find your way back to something good again. What Kind of Client are You? What Kind of Client are You?
