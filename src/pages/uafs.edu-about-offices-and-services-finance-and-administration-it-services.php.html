Once a user is enrolled with Portalguard, they can securely change a forgotten or expired password from any computer or smartphone anywhere in the world without having to contact the IT Service Desk. If your password is not working and you have previously enrolled with Portalguard, you can go to the Portalguard website and use the self-service feature to reset your password. For resetting passwords the email address will be the personal email address you enrolled with, NOT your UAFS email address. If your password is not working and you have NOT previously enrolled with Portalguard, please call the IT Service Desk at 479-788-7460 between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, and the staff will be happy to assist you. Enrolling with Portalguard First-time users should ensure that they enroll with the Portalguard system as soon as possible. Enrolling is easy, quick, and needs only be completed one time. Click here for a downloadable guide Accessing the Campus Wireless Network UAFS operates two wireless networks on campus: UAFS and UAFS-Guest. Students, faculty, and staff should always connect their devices to the UAFS network. The UAFS-Guest network is for temporary use only by authorized visitors to our campus (those without a campus network login). Do not connect your devices to any other wireless network. Guests using the UAFS-Guest network will be required to self-register. Registration requires a valid email address and mobile phone number that can receive text messages. Registrations are good for 24 hours. IMPORTANT: All users of the UAFS campus networks (both wired and wireless) agree to abide by the UAFS Acceptable Use Policy. They also agree to keep their computers updated with the latest operating system and anti-virus updates. Still Need Help with Logging into Campus Technologies? If you are still having trouble logging in to My.UAFS or are having trouble accessing other campus technologies, please first verify that your UAFS login credentials are working properly. You can do this by logging in to the UAFS Portalguard password management system. If you cannot log in to the Portalguard system and have previously enrolled with Portalguard, please use the self-service feature to recover or reset your password. Portalguard User Guide If you cannot reset your password, please call the IT Service Desk at 479-788-7460 between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, and the staff will be happy to assist you. 5210 Grand Avenue | P.O.
