Let us know what you find useful or needs improvement: Feedback Form 2nd floor exhibit The Arts of UAMS promotes the talents of UAMS employees, students and other members of the UAMS family for the benefit of campus life. The program was created in 1991 by Dr. Fred Guggenheim, Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at that time, with the support of Dr. Harry Ward, Chancellor at that time. The program is designed to be open to all UAMS connected individuals: students, faculty, staff, and their immediate families, as well as retired faculty. The Library Gallery is on the second floor of the UAMS Library. The main library entrance is located on the first floor of the Education II building. The exhibit program is open to all individuals with a UAMS connection: students, faculty, staff, and their immediate families, as well as retired faculty. At times, persons not connected to UAMS can exhibit when there is an available two-month time slot. Prospective exhibitors should contact Max Baker to submit an exhibit request. The main criterion is that the art be of \u201Cart gallery\u201D quality. The art can be photography, painting, three dimensional (if it will fit in a shadow box, for example), etc. At present, there are no facilities for exhibiting pottery, sculpture, etc. For more information about the Arts Council and the other exhibits go to http:\/\/arts.uams.edu\/the-uams-arts-council\/ Maternal Landscape by LeTisha Stacey, former UAMS Library Staff : Oct 23, 2017 9:11 AM URL: https:\/\/libguides.uams.edu\/arts Print Page Login to LibApps Tags: arts of UAMS, exhibit Page Title University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Connect with us: Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube LinkedIn Pinterest Disclaimer Jobs Copyright Statement Privacy Terms ? 2017 University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences | Little Rock, AR"}
