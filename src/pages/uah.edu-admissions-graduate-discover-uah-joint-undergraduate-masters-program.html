If a change is made to the initial JUMP application both a JUMP change form and a change to student's undergraduate Program of Study (POS) must be submitted for approval to your JUMP advisor. Students cannot hold a GTA, GRA, or graduate scholarship or fellowship until undergraduate degree is completed. Students must begin their graduate program within one year of their undergraduate graduation.
