We believe large-scale, commercial aquaculture businesses and resulting fish\/seafood production is vital to feed the increasing world population. What We Do About the Institute The Aquaculture and Fisheries Business Institute (AFBI) was chartered by the Auburn University Board of Trustees in 2012 and initially funded by The Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station for its first three years. AFBI was created in response to the global trends of rapidly expanding world demand for protein, limitations on arable land and water, and declining stocks of commercial wild-caught fish. We also believe that research must be applied and timely to produce solutions that will assist aquaculture producers, processors and supply chain members succeed in a business world. Connecting these groups is essential. 5 Research Projects 5 Aquaponics Greenhouse Hours Monday\u2014Friday 8:00AM \u2013 4:00PM Except Univ. Holidays AU Aquaponics Project Group The group is a transdisciplinary, collaborative research, teaching, and extension project, which includes members from Auburn University\u2019s Tiger Dining; School of Fisheries, Aquaculture, and Aquatic Sciences; and departments of Biosystems Engineering, Horticulture, and Poultry Science. The project was created to achieve several interdependent goals Aquaponics makes use of hydroponics and aquaculture technologies to provide a system in which nutrient-laden wastewater from fish production is used as a food source for plant growth. Water is pumped from fish tanks to the plants and as plants absorb nutrients the water is cleansed, allowing it to be recycled and reused. The project was created to achieve several interdependent goals: to conduct research, train students and other interested parties; to provide the latest information on the emerging technology of aquaponics; to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of aquaponics; to provide the campus community with high-quality, safe and fresh fish to be served in campus dining facilities; and to make Auburn University known as a leader in aquaponics research, teaching, and extension. The Facility The facility consists of four greenhouses, a filamentous algae cultivation system, and several raised garden beds. Fish and vegetables produced in the system are harvested on a regular basis and promptly shipped to campus dining facilities. The fish and produce are never frozen and are processed immediately on campus, providing the Auburn University community with the freshest possible healthful foods.

CARGILL ANIMAL NUTRITION Catfish Farm Video Current Aquaculture Activities The School of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences (SFAAS) maintains several off-campus field facilities to support our aquaculture research, teaching and extension\/outreach activities. They include 1800 acres of land and water 5 miles north of campus where work includes aquaculture in the study areas of genetics, nutrition, pathology, physiology, water chemistry and systems development. There is also a smaller field station 10 miles south of Auburn that is dedicated to mussel culture as a part of threatened and endangered species work. The Alabama Fish Farming Center in Greensboro focuses on field research, disease diagnosis and control, demonstrations and extension education. The Auburn Shellfish Laboratory located at The Dauphin Island Sea Lab on Dauphin Island focuses on research, student education and extension\/outreach mostly in the area of oyster research and development. Our research and teaching related to marine systems development and nutrition is carried out at the Claude Peteet Mariculture Center in Gulf Shores. Targeted species currently under study are marine shrimp and pompano. þ¨ Questions Call Us (334) 844-2345 Email Auburn COA Follow Auburnag Follow Follow Follow Follow ?2022 Auburn University College of Agriculture Visit Ag Hill Apply Request Info Contact Auburn University College of Agriculture 107 Comer Hall Auburn, AL 36849 Campus Map Webmaster Links College of Agriculture \/ AAES Intranet Auburn University AU Access A-Z Index Accessibility Copyright People Finder Privacy About Us Departments Directory Contact Us Overview Strategic Plan & Reports Leadership Faculty & Staff Resources Students Majors & Minors Graduate Degrees & Programs Career Discovery Clubs & Organizations Leadership Opportunities Student Resources Research AL Agricultural Experiment Station Centers & Institutes Research Focus Areas Research Funding & Resources Student Research Outreach Global Programs Study Abroad Alabama Cooperative Extension Auburn Oaks E.T.
