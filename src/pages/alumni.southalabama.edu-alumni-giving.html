Located in the heart of campus, the 15,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility will house the Chief Calvin W. McGhee Grand Ballroom, the McKinney Family Greek Plaza in honor of Sigma Chi Fraternity, a spacious lobby, a 30-seat boardroom, meeting rooms and administrative offices. Plans for a new alumni center began in 2015 and became a reality when Julian \u201973 and Kim MacQueen came forward with a $2 million gift. Julian MacQueen, founder of Innisfree Hotels headquartered in Pensacola, realized the importance of building a permanent alumni home on campus. The NAA broke ground on the Center on October 12, 2018. Construction is projected to be completed by 2020. Read the story here.
