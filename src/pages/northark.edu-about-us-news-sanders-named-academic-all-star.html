Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and anxiety force her to work harder than most to be successful in the classroom. The Northark softball player felt prepared to begin her first year of college in 2020, but a global pandemic changed everything. \u201CI soon found out that I would be attending classes virtually at NAC,\u201D the Harrison native said. \u201CI was afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay focused in my apartment where I had an unlimited amount of distractions and no parent to help keep me on track.\u201D Proactively working with her advisor, Northark\u2019s disabilities services office and individual instructors, Sanders finished her freshman year as a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) First Team Academic All American with a 4.0 GPA. The accolades do not stop there. Sanders also has been named the 2021 Arkansas Community Colleges (ACC) Academic All-Star for Northark. The distinction recognizes the scholarly and service achievements of Arkansas\u2019 two-year college students. Each All-Star receives a $500 scholarship for his\/her final semester to attend the nominating college, paid for by the nominating college. Sanders said the most rewarding educational experience she has had so far at Northark is finding herself during a time of uncertainty and fear. \u201CI learned that I\u2019m not defined by my disabilities,\u201D she said. \u201CThe unknown of COVID-19 forced me to stand up and advocate for myself. I learned that I was strong and capable of great things. I learned how to communicate with my instructors and now understand that being different is no better or worse, it's just different.\u201D Northark Head Softball Coach Seychelle Mahoney said there is not a more dedicated, hardworking person than Sanders. \u201CEmily\u2019s work ethic makes her flourish,\u201D she said. \u201CEmily is a leader. She is a person of volume. Some of her finest qualities begin with people.\u201D Sanders, who wants to be a math teacher and athletic coach, said she is ready to tackle her sophomore year of college with her newfound sense of purpose. \u201CWe all have our strengths and weaknesses, and my strengths and weaknesses make me powerful,\u201D she said. \u201CMy method of learning may be different from others, but I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, even in the middle of a global pandemic.\u201D After earning her associate of arts degree at Northark, Sanders plans on transferring to a four-year institution, though she is not quite sure which college yet, to obtain a Bachelor of Science in education mathematics. She also wants to minor in Spanish so she can receive an English as a Second Language certification and help children who speak limited English. Sanders will be recognized for her Academic All-Star award at the virtual ACC Annual Conference in the fall.
