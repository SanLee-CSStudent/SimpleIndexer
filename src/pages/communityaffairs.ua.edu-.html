We hope you will visit the site often, for it is our most important communication tool in our dual role as UA\u2019s leader in engaged scholarship and intercultural relations. While the terms \u201Cscholarship of engagement\u201D or \u201Cengaged scholarship\u201D \u2014 the terms are interchangeable \u2014 has been around for years, they may not be familiar to everyone. First used by Ernest Boyer in a 1996 article published in the Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement, Boyer sought nothing less than to redefine the role of higher education. He advocated a move away from scholarship as the \u201Capplication of academic expertise\u201D to a scholarship that creates partnerships between higher education and communities. He further argued that engaged scholarship integrates the often-conflicting faculty roles of teaching, research and service, seeing them instead as different aspects of a common purpose. Since Boyer, engaged scholarship has come to mean collaboration between knowledge professionals on campuses and the lay public for mutual benefit.
