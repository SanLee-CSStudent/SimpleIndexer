Students who plan to attend the University of Central Arkansas must also submit proof of two MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) shots or proper exemptions from the Arkansas Department of Health prior to registration. Students born before January 1, 1957 are exempt from this requirement. Admission Decisions Applications are processed on a rolling basis throughout the year. We estimate approximately three weeks to process your application. This estimation is based on complete applications (i.e., application, transcript(s), and test scores (if applicable) are received). However, this estimation is dependent upon the volume of applications received by the Office of Admissions. During high volume times, we will correspond with you via email to expedite communication. Students who do not meet minimum admission requirements may appeal their decision through the University Admissions Committee using the formal appeal form and supplying all requested supplemental items. Once your file has been reviewed, you will receive a letter with a final admission decision.
