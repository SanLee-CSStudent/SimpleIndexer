Memorial Gifts Each memorial donation to the Northark Memorial Legacy Scholarship Fund makes a difference in the lives of those who are struggling to make ends meet at home and at school.

The Northark Memorial Legacy Scholarship Fund considers the academic merit and financial need of the recipient.

The Foundation has provided more than $500,000 in scholarships to deserving students in the last five years. Donors interested in establishing a scholarship can choose from an endowed scholarship with income from the gift funding awards in perpetuity or an annual scholarship that is awarded on a year-to-year basis. Scholarships may be named in honor of the donor or in memory of a loved one.
