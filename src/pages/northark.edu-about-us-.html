Northark has two campuses and the Carroll County Center in Berryville, Ark. Northark History In 1973, a group of citizens met in Harrison to discuss the methods for establishing a community college. In November of that year the voters of Boone County approved a millage to finance permanent facilities for North Arkansas Community College. The college opened its doors in 1974 with 225 students. After construction of the Pioneer Pavilion, student center, and additional classrooms in 1980, a library and classroom construction project was completed in 1992. One year later, Northark was a partner in a \u201Cfirst\u201D for Arkansas: North Arkansas Community College and Twin Lakes Technical College became the state\u2019s first community college-technical college union. The facilities housing the former Twin Lakes Technical College became the North Campus of the college, which was renamed at the time North Arkansas Community\/Technical College. On July 1, 1997, North Arkansas Community\/Technical College was renamed North Arkansas College. The Carroll County Center opened in 2008 in Berryville, Ark. The facility makes the college\u2019s programs and services more accessible to citizens of its second-leading feeder county. An 11,000-square-foot, $3 million Allied Health Addition opened in 2010 on the south campus. The new area houses classrooms and labs for medical laboratory technology, surgical technology, and nursing, plus a computer lab for allied health students. Just a few months later the Bradley Student Center was dedicated on the south campus. The Bradley Student Center offers a \u201Cone-stop-shop\u201D for student services. It also provides an updated, more comfortable student lounge, including the College Grill, as a place for students to relax between classes. The facility is named in memory of Dr. William and Cora Bradley, grandparents of William P. Stiritz, in recognition of a major gift for the project from Stiritz and his wife, Dr. Susan E. Stiritz. In 2014, the Science Building, which houses two labs and a 60-seat auditorium-style classroom, opened its doors. Over the last several years, Northark has garnered national attention for academic quality, affordability and online offerings. The college is growing and is now examining the feasibility of adding residence halls to further expand access to education. Our vision is to be a premier institution, achieving excellence through innovation, technology, continuous improvement and quality instruction. Northark has a rich history, and the College is focusing on the future by preparing students for successful careers to answer workforce needs.
