Things You Need to Know The VA Certifying Official at SEARK provides enrollment certification information and help with veteran application forms. VA students must be working toward a degree and following the curriculum as outlined in their degree plan in the catalog, since only specific courses may be applied toward VA certification. If a student needs to take a class not part of their degree plan it first has to be approved by the VA Certifying Official. VA will not pay for a non-required repeat of classes; if SEARK College requires you to repeat the course to receive credit towards your degree, then VA will consider that a required repeat and the course will be applied towards the hours required for you to receive benefits. VA students are responsible for notifying the VA Certifying Official of any changes in their status. (add\/drop classes, withdraw from school, change major) Students that receive VA Educational Benefits that decide to change their degree plan or change schools are required to fill out a Change of Program \/ Place of Training before they can be certified for the following semester. Regular attendance of all classes is a requirement for VA payments. If you stop attending a class, VA will be notified, and you will be required to pay back benefits. VA students must maintain a 2.0 or higher GPA to be certified for Educational Benefits. Twelve undergraduate hours for a fall\/spring term is considered full-time and six hours is considered full-time for summer term for VA educational benefits. Each semester students are required to fill out a \u201CRequest to be Certified\u201D form for VA Educational Benefits to be certified.
