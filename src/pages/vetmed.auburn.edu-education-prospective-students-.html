This prepares them to enter a variety of careers within veterinary medicine. Students take 19 to 24 credit hours per term. This course load requires an average of 36 hours per week in the classroom or laboratory for students seeking to become a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. The curriculum is designed as a modified \u201Csystems approach.\u201D The first year primarily covers structure and function of the normal animal. This year includes gross and microscopic anatomy, imaging, physiology and other related courses. During the first semester of the second year, several principles courses are taught, such as immunology, infectious diseases, and pathology. Students then begin courses based on a body system (for example, gastrointestinal or cardiovascular systems). Each system includes appropriate pathology, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic measures for both large and small animal diseases. Each semester also includes a case-based course related to topics currently being taught.
