Thompson made the move up from the Board of Visitors, which he was elected to in October 2021, to make a long-lasting impact on the Lyon College community at large. \u201CI want to contribute to the building up of Lyon College\u2019s reputation as a leader in the Liberal Arts of the future,\u201D Thompson said. \u201CI believe that we are in times now where the value of the liberal arts education and the philosophy of developing the whole person \u2013 not just the scholastic component\u2013 needs to be re-asserted and demonstrated in new fields of play.\u201D With Lyon College\u2019s Sesquicentennial unfolding this year, Thompson knows that now is the time to begin solidifying the College\u2019s position in higher education. \u201CLyon has the depth of talent and credentials necessary to be a leader in this charge, and, in doing so, embark on creating the next 150 years of educational legacy for thousands and thousands of students who will contribute to society long after many of us are gone.\u201D In addition to being a previous member of Lyon College\u2019s Board of Visitors, Thompson has traveled abroad with a Rotary International fellowship and worked across the U.S. alongside various name-brand companies. Currently he acts as the CEO of Illinois-headquartered business Nielsen-Massey Vanillas, a family-owned vanilla and flavor extract company. Coming equipped with several years of experience and knowledge, it can be easy to forget that Thompson started his journey as just another student here at Lyon College. \u201CI was a student-athlete, involved in various campus groups and activities, and ended up getting a triple major and a minor\u2026 so it was a busy four years,\u201D said Thompson, laughing, \u201Cbut I know I wouldn\u2019t have worked so hard nor accomplished so much if not for the amazing caliber of all the people around me: students, faculty and staff.\u201D He continued, \u201COne of the best things about Lyon was the strong investment by the faculty and staff in the development and success of students.\u201D Thompson noted that it wasn\u2019t just the people that were amazing, but also the welcoming and encouraging environment that Lyon College cultivated. \u201CI remember a vibrant campus culture that encouraged students to get involved & seek out new experiences, which made trying out new things very accessible,\u201D Thompson said. Having that first-hand experience with the community here, Thompson feels confident that he can make a positive impact at Lyon College. He continued, \u201CBeing an alum brings with it an understanding of the rich legacy, educational philosophy and \u2018ground-level\u2019 experience of Lyon, along with a vested passion in its continued success into the future.\u201D But something like this can\u2019t be accomplished by just a single person, so Thompson wants the community to know that his door is open. \u201CI would love to hear from people. Whether it is just a quick catch up or if someone wants to share an idea to help or get involved with Lyon, I invite anyone to please reach out!\u201D Lyon alumni Board of Trustees ?
