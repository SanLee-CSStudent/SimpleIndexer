Chair Scott Miller called the meeting to order at 8:04am. Trustees Chris McNew, R.G. Earnest, Sarah Newman, and Debbie Johnson. Consent Agenda The Consent Agenda included Increase in part time instructor (adjunct and overload) pay rate. Chair Miller asked for a motion to approve the Consent Agenda. A motion was made by Trustee Earnest, seconded by Trustee Johnson, and unanimously approved. Board Comments Dr. Esters stated essentially, we are asking you to approve an increase of $25 per credit hour for adjunct instructors and for overload instruction. We have not increased part time instruction in several years. We talked about this last March but pulled it from consideration when the State made the big cut to the budget. It will have a $26,817 impact on the annual budget. Trustee Earnest commented with this being postponed a year and the total amount spent is not materialled of much of an increase, it will show our appreciation to our adjunct. Trustee Johnson agreed with Trustee Earnest\u2019s comments and supports this item. Trustee Earnest moved to adjourn the meeting. Trustee seconded Johnson the motion, which was unanimously approved.
