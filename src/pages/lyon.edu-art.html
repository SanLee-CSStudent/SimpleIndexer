Combining the liberal arts with a broad studio experience, majors develop the necessary knowledge, technical skill, and commitment to work as an artist today. Students are immersed in a creative learning environment and encouraged to cultivate an approach to art informed by traditional two- and three-dimensional art practices, experimental approaches, and new digital technologies. They will participate in regular critiques and interact with faculty and peers in a critical context. This critique system creates an environment that encourages students to try new techniques, solve difficult problems, and push boundaries. Majors may choose to focus on a particular area as they work closely with faculty to prepare for graduate school, work professionally as artists, or pursue art-related fields. % of Art majors are employed or in grad school within 6 months of graduation :1 student-to-teacher ratio % of those who graduate, do so in 4 years or less Meet the Faculty Details Careers Admissions Internships Scholarships Why Choose the Art Program at Lyon College?

Because the class sizes are so small, we get to jump right into projects. This also means that the professors are also able to dedicate more time to helping us refine our artistic skills.\u201D -Logan Hubberd, \u201821 \u201CWhen I came to college I never thought I would be participating in such impactful projects across the Batesville community. Being an art major has taught me how to make meaningful connections through public art. I have been able to design and complete two large-scale murals and promote the positive influence art can have on a community while attending Lyon College. The art program has not only taught me technical skills, but also how to be an involved citizen and community member.\u201D -Hayley Cormican Interesting Places Employers of recent Lyon College Art Graduates include: Google, Metals Museum in Memphis, Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, Arkansas Department of Transportation, and the San Francisco Ballet Additionally, Lyon College Art Graduates move on to prestigious graduate schools including: Studio Arts College International in Florence, Italy, Florida State University, and the Paris College of Art Careers for Art Majors Some popular careers for art majors include: Art historian Art therapist Arts administrator Graphic designer Art educator Artist Designer Social media coordinator Marketing manager Photographer Ceramicist Commercial printer Muralist Starting Median U.S. Salary For an Art Major The starting median salary in the U.S. for a college graduate with an art degree is $35,800.
