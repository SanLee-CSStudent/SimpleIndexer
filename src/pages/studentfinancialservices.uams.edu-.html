In order to better serve you, our office is divided into three divisions: Financial Aid Office, Bursar\u2019s Office and Debt Management. The role of the Financial Aid Office is to actively assist students in seeking and securing financial resources by providing financial information and services in a professional and individualized manner. The role of the Bursar\u2019s Office is to coordinate the disbursement of awarded financial aid, process tuition payments, and manage UAMS campus based loans. The role of the Debt Management & Liaison for Homeless & Foster Students office is to provide you with resources in all areas of financial literacy, such as managing your student loans and budgeting. Paying for your UAMS education can be challenging, but we are here to assist you. State and federal laws mandate many of our policies and procedures, but we will do our best to provide you with optimum funding based on those regulations. Occasionally, the answers we provide to your questions are not what you would like to hear, but we can assure you that no questions will go unanswered. We are here to look out for your interests at every point in the process. Some good advice: START EARLY! Applying for aid can take 8 to 12 weeks from start to finish. Please complete all application procedures carefully and return the needed documents and information to us as soon as possible to meet priority deadlines. This will ensure funds are available by the college\u2019s tuition due date. Thank you for choosing UAMS for your educational experience. Our office is eager to help you succeed.
