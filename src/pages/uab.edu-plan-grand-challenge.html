What is the UAB Grand Challenge? More UAB Grand Challenge winning proposal announced April 30, 2019 Healthy Alabama 2030: Live HealthSmart is the winning project selected for the inaugural UAB Grand Challenge. Led by Principal Investigator Dr. Mona Fouad, director of the UAB Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center, the project plans to make Alabama a model of healthy living. By expanding proven innovations and changing policies, neighborhoods, schools and workplaces, Healthy Alabama 2030 aims to dramatically improve the health of all Alabamians by elevating our state out of the bottom 10 in national health rankings by the year 2030.
