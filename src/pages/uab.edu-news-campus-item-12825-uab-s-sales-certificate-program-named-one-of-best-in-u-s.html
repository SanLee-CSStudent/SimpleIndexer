The program focuses on business-to-business sales situations, providing students with a strong knowledge of how to be effective when selling in business markets. While sales careers are known for a high turnover rate, UAB sales students tend to stay with their employers longer because of the understanding of what it takes to be successful before beginning their sales careers. Hansen says several factors make the Collat School of Business\u2019 program stand out. \u201CAll faculty members who teach within the program have relevant, real-world experience,\u201D he said. \u201CWe offer state-of-the-art facilities through the new Collat School of Business building.
