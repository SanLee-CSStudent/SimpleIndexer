The fall 2022 semester will offer enhanced student life on Northark\u2019s campus. Pioneer Villas dorms will be open and now a new sport, soccer, will join the current lineup of men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, baseball, softball and esports. Northark President Rick Massengale told Trustees at the October meeting many of the colleges feeder high schools offer soccer. Bergman, Berryville, Eureka Springs, Green Forest, Harrison, Huntsville, Lead Hill and Mountain Home field teams. The College already has a soccer field that will be extended to meet regulations and they are currently searching for a coach to lead the new team. \u201CHiring the coach will be our first action and the process will start immediately, with hopes of the coach being in place by January,\u201D Massengale told Trustees. \u201CThe coach will then start recruiting and having open tryouts with the intent to assemble the team next semester and start competing next fall. With the local talent in the area high schools, I am very optimistic that we can field a very competitive team from the start. Our area soccer programs are strong as is evidenced by the success in their respective high school competitions,\u201D he said. \u201CI get excited thinking about bringing all the talented athletes in the area who have competed against each other over the years together into one team, plus, they will be playing at the collegiate level in front of their families and friends. Between the women and men\u2019s teams, I am hoping to have 60 soccer players on campus for the first year.\u201D The Northark Pioneer soccer team will compete as a Division II NJCAA sport.
