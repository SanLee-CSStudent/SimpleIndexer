I come from a diverse, multi-lingual family, many of whom are from Mexico and Central America. Being a product of so many diverse cultures and experiences, I have a unique advantage when it comes to being empathetic to the cultural diversity represented in our youth today. I don\u2019t know that I would have been able to continue my education at this point in my life\u2014being in my thirties\u2014if it were not for the Arizona Teachers Academy scholarship.\u201D \u2013 Ixchel Christine Orellana, Elementary Education major, Mesa Community College"}
