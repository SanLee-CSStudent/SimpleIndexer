We work to ensure that we are providing students a safe, comfortable, and exciting living experience that enhances academic achievement, foster personal development, and promote college success. Offering a range of residential communities, including traditional double rooms, suite-style residence halls, and apartments, we strive to prepare students for success through diverse and innovative living and learning environments that helps to promote respect and responsibility among students and encourage them to learn from one another. With more than 80 percent of our students living on campus, we want to make the Hilltop your home. We know that your room is more than just a spot to sleep and study - it's the place to discover and learn about yourself. It is not a dorm; it is a residence hall because community is key at Birmingham-Southern. We require all students to live on campus for three years. Most stay all four years because they love the atmosphere and convenience! Our eight residence halls and on-campus apartment complex all include high-speed wireless internet access, cable TV, and free on-site laundry facilities - no quarters needed, just bring the detergent! If you have questions regarding living on the Hilltop, please do not hesitate to contact us or stop by to see us on the 2nd floor of the Norton Campus Center in the Student Development Suite.
