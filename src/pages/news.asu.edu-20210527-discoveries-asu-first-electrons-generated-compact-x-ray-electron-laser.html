The achievement is a major operational step as the ASU scientists race to complete the project's first phase, called a compact X-ray light source (CXLS). \u201CThis is a kind of eureka moment, when we turn everything on, all of these complex systems, and we see those first electrons being generated,\u201D said William Graves, an associate professor of physics at ASU and researcher at the Biodesign Center for Applied Structural Discovery. \u201CWe were very excited to get first electrons.\u201D Video of ASU\u2019s Compact X-ray Free Electron Laser (CXEFL) Program Video by Steve Filmer Once fully operational, the CXLS will make ultrashort pulses of X-rays to probe into the secrets of biology, medicine and advanced materials. The first applications may include: Drug design and medicine research. Medical imaging research. Semiconductor quality control and research. Renewable energy research. X-ray visionaries For example, in biology, the CXLS acts like an ultrafast camera to see proteins and other building blocks of biology dynamically at work, analogous to how the very first X-rays yielded new views of our bodies. \u201CX-rays have been used for a hundred years to see what\u2019s invisible, to see inside our bodies, but also to see molecular structure, to see how proteins are made,\u201D Graves said. But while conventional X-ray sources have been limited to taking static pictures, recent developments provide access to nature\u2019s rapid dynamics. Indeed, a major goal of the finished CXLS device is to see reactions and relationships as they happen, said Graves, \u201Ctaking high-speed movies of chemical reactions and molecules in action.\u201D Seeing molecules in action is often the first step in finding new biological targets for drug discovery. As designed, the work of the device starts with packets of electrons generated by focusing extremely short ultraviolet laser pulses onto a copper surface. These electrons are accelerated to nearly the speed of light by a 1-meter-long linear accelerator and strong microwave-frequency electromagnetic fields with megawatt peak power. Next, they form a directed beam by passing a series of precision-aligned magnets. The resulting electron beam is blasted by an intense optical laser, which imparts an undulating motion on the electrons resulting in strong and predictable X-ray emission. Once generated, the X-rays can then be used to reveal the atomic structures and functions of biomolecules and novel materials. They are images of how life works. \u201CWe want to capture not just the static structure, but how it works,\u201D Graves said. \u201CWhat\u2019s the function of the different molecules? Can we actually see the reaction taking place? We\u2019d like to create a kind of stop-motion movie of the making and breaking of chemical bonds. And by doing that, we gain much more insight into how the chemistry and the molecules work,\u201D he added. Graves says this could lead to new advanced understanding in several areas of scientific research. \u201CFor instance, in how drugs are able to impact viruses. In developing new drugs, or looking at exotic materials that are so-called high temperature superconductors that could revolutionize energy production, because they don\u2019t use any power to store the energy. And we don\u2019t yet understand the physics of that,\u201D he added. The program would not have been possible without visionary philanthropists who wanted to spur new technologies to aid drug discovery and help alleviate human suffering and disease. In 2018, the program received a major boost with a generous $10 million contribution from Annette and Leo Beus to create the Beus Compact X-ray Free Electron Laser Lab. During the past few years, the program has generated much anticipation and excitement among scientists in the field and attracted scores of scientists to ASU. Recently, condensed-matter and laser scientist Robert Kaindl was brought in as the first director of the CXFEL Science Program and an ASU faculty member in the Department of Physics. The lab opened in the ASU Biodesign C building in the fall of 2018, and since that time, deputy director and research scientist Mark Holl has spearheaded the design, engineering and construction of the complex equipment inside the lab. About 100 researchers and students from ASU and other institutions are involved in these efforts, with both the design work and the construction of CXLS continuing at a rapid pace despite the ongoing COVID pandemic. Flipping the switch In the first phase of the project, the team is building the compact X-ray light source, or CXLS. Using an optical laser in the X-ray generation reduces the length of the electron undulator and the accelerator by many orders of magnitude. Reducing size and cost means that more universities and institutions could build similar sources, putting more minds to work looking at things like proteins. The milestone for CXLS also represents a significant technical leap forward to ushering in the next phase of the ASU project, a future planned compact X-ray free electron laser (CXFEL). This will produce even more powerful X-rays with even shorter pulse durations to obverve the fundamental motions of electrons in molecules and materials and to capture biology in action with even greater fidelity. The overarching goal of the program is to help scientists gain greater access to the emerging XFEL science to make new discoveries. Currently there are only about a handful of X-ray free-electron lasers around the world, because they are based on mile-long particle accelerators with associated billion-dollar construction costs. A single experiment can cost several hundreds of thousands of dollars to run. But because they generate the most powerful and shortest pulses of X-rays in the world today, the X-ray beams of the big XFELs are used to find fundamental answers to some of the most important questions in biology, chemistry and physics. The revolutionary ASU CXFEL promises to dramatically shrink the costs and footprint from mile-long, billion-dollar underground bunkers of existing XFELs to garage-size, million-dollar startup labs \u2014 while enabling completely new science. Currently, such studies are limited and spread among the handful of large accelerator-based free-electron lasers around the world. A further breakthrough will be needed for the transition from the innovative CXLS to the envisioned future CXFEL. In 2019, the National Science Foundation announced its support of the next-stage CXFEL project with a $4.7 million grant to fund a comprehensive design study of the new device. Graves says this step will be a technology to create a nanopattern for the electrons, which would put them into a precise arrangement. The next steps in the application of CXLS and development of a CXFEL machine make these sources a centerpiece for future industry partnerships and scientific collaboration, as well as real-world opportunities for students to get experience in physics, biology and engineering.

The $10 million investment will help shape the future of research, medical imaging, cultural heritage, quantum information and energy.

This year, a severe lack of volunteers and sponsors \u2013 the lifeblood of a golf tournament \u2013 led the tournament\u2019s founder to think seriously about shelving the 2021 event as well. That is, until Faircloth sought help from an Arizona State University clinical assistant professor and her event management students to solicit, sign up and train volunteers. Without their involvement, the event would not have been possible, he said.

Four students \u2014 Jordan Fezler, Fernanda Garcia, Jennifer Lopez and Matteo Zazza \u2014 met with Faircloth last fall. They and Schneiderman became captains of the event\u2019s volunteer corps, developing a plan to fulfill the tournament\u2019s many expectations. They produced a marketing flier and created a database of organizations from which to recruit volunteers.

Photo by Erin Schneiderman\/ASU The requests circulated widely throughout the ASU community, Schneiderman said, but the largest number of volunteers were employees from the university\u2019s own facilities department. A total of 75 volunteers signed up. Sponsors also started getting on board once Valley-based golf equipment manufacturer Ping stepped forward as presenting partner, Faircloth said. Hanger Clinic and About Golf joined as official partners, while Adaptive Golfers, Ability360, About Golf, Troon Golf and the PGA of America all made in-kind contributions. The Arizona Golf Association also helped organizers run the event, Faircloth said. Once the volunteers were enlisted, the students applied their classroom knowledge to properly train them to perform jobs ranging from caddy to course marshal, scorekeeper, photographer and registration worker, Schneiderman said. And the Open went on, successfully hosting 82 golfers with disabilities from 32 states, each one competing in one of nine classifications.

Photo by Erin Schneiderman\/ASU Faircloth said the tournament had to be a cherished memory for players, something that they felt proud to be participating in, even if they didn\u2019t win a prize. The ASU students were key to making that happen, he said. \u201CWithout volunteers it would be an everyday event, and that is not what we are trying to do,\u201D Faircloth said. Students worked in two full-day shifts during the week of the tournament. Lopez, a nonprofit leadership and management major, said participating combined her academic knowledge with on-the-course experience. \u201CIt gave me a hands-on opportunity to see what it was like to be a volunteer coordinator, how it was to run an event and have everyone looking up to you for guidance,\u201D Lopez said. \u201CI believe it gave me an experience towards my academic career that has shifted it forward.\u201D Lopez said she learned an important lesson: \u201CThat it is OK to be 100% prepared and things still won\u2019t go as planned, but as long as you stay focused, calm and collected, things have a way of working themselves out for the better.\u201D Garcia, a tourism development and management major with a concentration in meetings and events, said watching the event take off was amazing. \u201CThis experience has been awesome,\u201D Garcia said. \u201CWitnessing everyone come together and participate in the event is fascinating to me, because we are all here for different yet similar reasons, and we all have different experiences. Participating in things like this gets me excited in starting my career in special event management.\u201D Zazza, a parks and recreation major, said the experience helped him expand his horizons as an aspiring physical therapist. \u201CThrough this opportunity that ASU gave me, I am realizing what my passion is. I can change the lives of people where it matters,\u201D he said. \u201CI don\u2019t have much experience with golf, but this was a taste of the real world and an opportunity to take what I learned in the classroom and apply it to help others.\u201D Players also took notice of the students\u2019 contributions.

Erin Schneiderman\/ASU \u201CThe volunteers have been very helpful with the pace of play,\u201D said Douglas Shirakura, who is from New York. \u201CThey are a really nice touch.\u201D Andreas Brandenberger traveled from Greece to play in the tournament. He said his experience has been \u201Cabsolutely amazing.\u201D \u201CI think the volunteers from ASU have been just fantastic in helping out with the USDGA,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s really huge and it shows that they\u2019re committed to making golf more accessible to everyone.\u201D Brandenberger said he saw volunteers deftly handling several roles. \u201CHaving the volunteers out there and having them be a part of the spectator crowd, taking some photos and interacting with players, shows a big commitment to the game, helping everybody just play the game and feel part of it,\u201D Brandenberger said. \u201CIt\u2019s a sport for everyone, and coming out here and showing their commitment to other players who are learning the game and thriving out here in different conditions, it\u2019s a pretty remarkable thing.\u201D Schneiderman said it was an honor to welcome the elite group of golfers to Arizona. \u201COur ASU students have absolutely shined that week,\u201D she said. \u201CThey have served in multiple capacities ensuring this tournament was a success, and I could not be prouder of their hard work and dedication.\u201D Solutions Downtown Phoenix campus Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions School of Community Resources and Development Community service Community involvement Sports Community Student Prospective student Mark J.
