UAB Medicine Infusion Therapy has a new home in The Kirklin Clinic of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, bringing personalized, team-based, efficient and state-of-the-art care to UAB\u2019s infusion patients and their families. UAB\u2019s Infusion Therapy is the largest and only magnet-designated infusion therapy center in the state of Alabama, expanding access to expert care with modern and patient- and family-centered amenities. Patients with diseases and conditions such as but not limited to cancer, sickle cell disease, immune deficiencies and auto immune diseases are commonly treated through infusion therapy, in which medication is directly inserted into a vein. UAB\u2019s Infusion Therapy offers chemotherapy, blood products, antibiotics, immunotherapies, injections and central line care. With infusion therapy often taking several hours to complete, the new clinic space has been designed with family, privacy and comfort in mind. The 84-chair clinic offers a tremendous amount of natural light and openness, while also providing individual and private space for patients; this enables families and support systems to be present during infusion appointments. \u201CWe are proud that we are able to offer the highest standards of comfort for our patients, specifically those who are coming to us regularly for continued outpatient treatment,\u201D said Jordan DeMoss, vice president of Clinical Operations at UAB Hospital. \u201CAs part of the O\u2019Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, the new clinic supports our mission at UAB Medicine to expand access and unmatched cancer care to all patients who seek our services.\u201D In addition to enhanced privacy, patient chairs have up-to-date technology including outlets for chargers, heating and reclining capabilities, and access to personal televisions and complimentary Wi-Fi. Furthermore, amenities like more Cold Cap machines for hair retention are available for women who may be interested in using them during their cancer treatments. \u201CThe goal was to have our physicians and teams partner with the architects to design the optimal treating and healing environment for our patients and their companions,\u201D explained Patricia J. Pritchett, J.D., BSN, senior vice president of Ambulatory Services at UAB Health System. In Infusion Therapy\u2019s new space, the merging of pharmacy services, laboratories and treatment will improve efficiency of treatment visits. It also brings the experts together in one space alongside patients and their families. Another benefit for oncology patients specifically includes care from Oncology Care Certified Nursing staff and Oncology-specialized Pharmacists that will support the highest level of cancer care and specialized education in the state. \u201CWith our new Infusion Therapy space, we are looking forward to blending expertise and personalized care that will further enhance the understanding and experience of patients receiving chemotherapy or other infusions,\u201D explained Lisle Nabell, M.D., professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology and Oncology, as well as medical director of Infusion Therapy. \u201CWe believe that, by consolidating our personnel and resources \u2014 in combination with open and new patient rooms and spaces \u2014 we will help to make infusion therapy time-efficient for patients and provide the highest level of patient guidance possible; this unit was designed with keeping the patient experience at the center of all aspects of development.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
