News Tuskegee University Partners with Propel Center, a New Global HBCU Headquarters for Innovation January 13, 2021 Rendering of the Propel Center, an innovation hub for the entire HBCU community that will provide curriculum, internships, and mentorship opportunities. Contact: Kawana McGough, Office of Communications, Public Relations and Marketing Tuskegee University is proud to announce its partnership with Propel Center, a new global campus headquartered in Atlanta that will support innovative learning and development for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) nationwide. Tuskegee will collaborate with Propel Center and the entire HBCU community to bring leadership and career development programming to its students. Propel Center was imagined and designed by Ed Farm, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing education through technology \u2014 with Apple and Southern Company supporting the project as founding partners. The Propel Center is designed to connect HBCU students to technology curriculum, cultural thought leaders, entrepreneurship skills development, and accelerator programs, with a focus on social justice and equity. The first-of-its-kind initiative will serve as a hub for all 100+ HBCUs, and is designed to connect students and faculty from across the community and provide them with the knowledge, skills, tools and resources necessary to transform our nation\u2019s talent pipeline and workforce. Curriculum options will include AI and machine learning, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment arts, app development, augmented reality, design and creativity, career preparation, and entrepreneurship tracks. \u201CTuskegee is home to some of the most creative and talented faculty and students in the country,\u201D said Interim President, Dr. Charlotte P. Morris. \u201CThe Propel Center will offer them unique learning opportunities. It will afford our students access to innovative techniques and tools that will enhance their value in the communities they will ultimately serve.\u201D Students from participating schools will access Propel Center\u2019s online digital learning platform from anywhere, and will also have access to the 50,000 square-foot Propel Center headquarters in Atlanta, equipped with state-of-the-art lecture halls, learning labs, and on-site living for a scholars-in-residence program. \u201CThe HBCU community is a tremendous engine of Black creativity, entrepreneurship, and inclusive opportunity,\u201D said Lisa Jackson, Apple\u2019s Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. \"We are thrilled to join with partners and community stakeholders to support the Propel Center and be part of this groundbreaking new global hub for HBCU innovation and learning, devoted to helping faculty create best-in-class curriculum and ensuring students have access to cutting-edge skills.\u201D \u201CWe know inequities exist in our society, and it\u2019s up to each of us to be more intentional in our efforts to make a difference and bridge the gap,\u201D said Tom A. Fanning, chairman, president and CEO of Southern Company. \u201CWe know more must be done, and the establishment of the Propel Center is another important demonstration of Southern Company fulfilling our commitment to move our communities to a more equitable future. Partnering with Apple in this initiative is an exciting way to connect future leaders with these critical resources.\u201D \u201CThese investments are critical as we begin to truly scale Black innovation ecosystems,\u201D said Anthony Oni, chairman, Ed Farm. \u201CBy leveraging technology and partnerships to connect students with unique learning opportunities, we can lift up the talent that already exists at these institutions of higher learning and accelerate their development. In doing so, we will have a hand in shaping the workforce of the future \u2014 and the leaders of tomorrow.\u201D Additional information on Propel Center can be found at PropelCenter.org. ? 2021 Tuskegee University ?
