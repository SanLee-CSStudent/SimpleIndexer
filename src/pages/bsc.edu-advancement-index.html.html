For more than a century, people like you have empowered Birmingham-Southern to deliver an excellent liberal arts education. BSC students access experiential learning, stellar recourses and instructors, and a tight-knit community through gifts to the College. Ways to Give Give Now COVID-19 UPDATE: HOW YOU CAN HELP While we are sensitive to how COVID-19 has likely affected many in the BSC family, we have heard from alumni and friends who have asked how they can help. If you are in a position to give, the College has two direct ways to make an immediate impact: Student Emergency Fund : Assisting students who, due to unforeseen emergency circumstances, are facing financial hardships, a gift to the Student Emergency Fund helps meet immediate and essential expenses, allowing students to focus on their academic coursework. Forward Ever Fund : A gift to the Forward Ever Fund will provide additional scholarship dollars for students whose financial need has been affected by COVID-19. An estimated 56 percent of our students will face additional challenges related to the cost of college, according to a survey conducted by OneClass. Our goal is for every student, regardless of circumstance, to find success at BSC. If you are not in a position to give at this time, please consider supporting a small business with a BSC connection. We\u2019ve posted a list of businesses and their COVID-19 plans on The BSC Blog here. To add a BSC-connected business to the list, please fill out our Google form. Your support now can help keep those small businesses going during this uncertain time. Thank you for your generosity during this challenging time. We\u2019ll get through it together!
