Samford University provides work opportunities for students through the two following programs: The Federal Work Study program (FWS) is need-based, as determined by the FAFSA, and the Institutional Student Employment Program (ISEP) which is not need-based.

Students may contact employers about on-campus jobs directly. International students should contact the Global Engagement Office at geo@samford.edu or 205-726-2741 regarding federal regulations for on-campus employment. If they are given authorization to work on campus, they should send an email to studentjobs@samford.edu with the name of the supervisor and\/or department where they\u2019ve been hired before completing any paperwork. Federal Work Study Students must work with the One Stop to determine if they qualify for the FWS program. Learn more about FWS. Institutional Student Employment Program If you do not qualify for the Federal Work Study program, you may still be able to find on-campus employment through Samford\u2019s Institutional Student Employment Program.

Your supervisor will need to see your work authorization and may ask you to send them a screenshot of it for their records. You may begin working when you receive your work authorization. Federal Work Study Information Federal Work Study (FWS) is a form of federal aid which allows undergraduate and graduate students to work through student employment and earn money to help pay for education expenses. Financial need and eligibility for FWS is determined through completion of the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Students must work with the One Stop to determine whether or not they qualify for the FWS program. Student employees earning FWS funds will be paid hourly and through Samford student payroll on a biweekly basis. Information regarding a FWS award, earnings, and remaining balance can be found on the SU Portal. Federal Work Study (On-Campus) Students may contact employers about on-campus jobs directly or search a list of available on campus positions with job description, job requirements and contact information. Most jobs for the fall semester will be listed by August. Federal Work Study (Off-Campus) Students who are eligible for FWS also have the option of finding employment through the FWS Community Work Service Program. This program allows students to work for a local nonprofit organization or public agency, or as a reading\/math tutor for local elementary schools through the America Reads and America Counts Programs while utilizing their FWS award. Possible opportunities may be viewed on the Agency List. Students interested in working through this program should contact the One Stop at onestop@samford.edu, 205-726-2905.
