What she thought was an opportunity to see a new part of the world turned out to completely change the trajectory of her life. Ten years later, Dr. Hagues leads Samford students on a service-learning trip to collaborate with the Africa Inland Church in Tanzania (AICT). Both social work and pharmacy students engage in an innovative two and half week curriculum that gives them opportunities to work directly with women from the Ukerewe and Musoma communities. Dr. Hagues leads the program alongside Dr. Murphy from the McWhorter Pharmacy School and intends to grow new opportunities in Tanzania through Samford Abroad for internships, research, and continued learning. \u201CFor me, it completely opened my eyes and put me on a different life trajectory than what I thought I would be on. I think it can do that for anyone. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll do research in Africa, but it does mean you\u2019re more aware of the needs in the world. It changes the things that we care about.\u201D \u2013Dr. Rachel Hagues, Samford University Professor Samford Abroad Programs Each year approximately 280 Samford students participate in Samford\u2019s more than 50 international study programs. Within this portfolio of international educational options for Samford students includes both Samford sponsored and affiliate programs in partnership with selected university partners in cities like Rome, Italy; San Jose, Costa Rica; Paris, France; Hong Kong; and Jerusalem, Israel. Students can study abroad for May Term, summer, or semester. The flagship of the Samford Abroad portfolio is the Daniel House, a 5-story home in central London, roughly a mile from Kensington Palace. The Daniel House is used by students and faculty as both a home and a classroom and provides the setting for Samford faculty to develop students in an inspiring cultural context as affordably as possible. In 2018, the Daniel House underwent a more than $2 million renovation to update both the living facilities and academic potential of the property as well as some needed structural updates.
