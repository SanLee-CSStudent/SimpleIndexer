NSF award will boost UAB research in machine-learning-enabled plasma synthesis of novel materials The $20 million National Science Foundation award will help UAB and eight other Alabama-based universities build research infrastructure. UAB\u2019s share will be about $2 million. Novel preclinical drug could have potential to combat depression, brain injury and cognitive disorders The drug inhibits the kinase Cdk5, found in mature neurons. Cdk5 has long been implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions, but previous inhibitors have largely failed to reach the brain through the blood-brain barrier. A gene in tuberculosis bacteria is found essential for siderophore secretion and virulence This discovery validates siderophore secretion as a drug target in tuberculosis and reveals a new mechanism for putative drugs. Many tuberculosis bacteria are highly resistant to multiple antibiotics. Methylation of tRNA-derived fragments regulates gene-silencing activity in bladder cancer This novel mode of altering gene silencing boosts the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells, helping those cells survive during rapid growth.
