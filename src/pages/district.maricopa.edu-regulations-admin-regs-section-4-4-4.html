MCCCD recognizes that the free exchange of opinions and ideas is essential to academic freedom, and the advancement of educational, research, service, operational, and management purposes, is furthered by making these resources accessible. Arizona constitutional and statutory mandates require that MCCCD resources, including technology, be used only for the public\u2019s business, and not for private purposes. Those mandates apply to all MCCCD public officials\u2013employees of every kind and the Governing Board. The aim of those laws is to safeguard the use of resources, including technology resources, acquired and maintained with public funds. Compliance with other laws\u2013both federal and state\u2013also dictates the need for standards for the use of MCCCD technology resources. In some cases, the Governing Board policies emphasize the importance of compliance with the law such as the requirement to adhere to copyright laws. Governing Board policies also establish MCCCD\u2019s own standards, such as the directive that all persons within the MCCCD community be treated in a manner that is humane, fair and dignified. This administrative regulation establishes standards for the use of MCCCD technology resources. They should be seen as supplementing, and not in lieu of, Governing Board policy, applicable law and other applicable administrative regulations such as Administrative Regulation 4.3 \u201CElectronic Communications.\u201D General Responsibilities Technology resources (including, but not limited to, desktop and laptop systems, printers, central computing facilities, MCCCD-wide or college-wide networks, local-area networks, telephones, facsimile machines, scanners, access to the Internet, electronic mail and similar electronic devices and information) of the MCCCD are available to MCCCD Governing Board members, employees, students and, in a limited number of cases, MCCCD contractors and the public. Use of all those resources is subject to the standards set forth in this regulation (Standards). The first screen that each MCCCD computer exhibits on starting up advises users of these Standards and requires an acknowledgment before the user may proceed to the next screen. Additionally, all MCCCD employees are responsible for annually acknowledging receipt of the Blue Book, which contains this regulation. So all users of MCCCD technology resources are presumed to have read and understood the Standards. While the Standards govern use of technology resources MCCCD-wide, an individual community college or center may establish guidelines for technology resource usage that supplement, but do not replace or waive, these Standards. Use of Non-MCCCD Technology Under Arizona\u2019s public records law, MCCCD is required to transact business so that its records are accessible and retrievable. The policy underlying the law is that work done in the name of the public be transparent. Thus, any member of the public may request public records and, except in a few specific instances, are entitled to get copies of them. Each individual employee or Governing Board member is responsible for ensuring that MCCCD records that he or she initiates or receives are retained for the period of time required by and disposed of according to mandates established by Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records\u2013the state agency tasked with setting standards for record retention. Therefore, an employee\u2019s or Governing Board member\u2019s use of non-MCCCD technology resources for communication of any type of MCCCD business is heavily discouraged because those records are less capable of being managed according to MCCCD\u2019s process for ensuring retention, retrieval and disclosure set forth in Administrative Regulation 4.15 \u201CRetrieval, Disclosure and Retention of Records.\u201D Additionally, an MCCCD employee who receives a communication allegedly from another MCCCD employee using a non-MCCCD e-mail address is not required to respond substantively to that e-mail. The employee receiving the e-mail is entitled to verify that the sender is whom he or she says that he or she is. The employee receiving the e-mail may request that the sender provide the information or inquiry set forth in the e-mail via hard-copy form. Acceptable Use Use of MCCCD\u2019s technology resources, including websites created by MCCCD employees and students, is limited to educational, research, service, operational and management purposes of the MCCCD and its member institutions. Likewise, data, voice, images and links to external sites posted on or transmitted via MCCCD\u2019s technology resources are limited to the same purposes. Frequently, access to MCCCD\u2019s technology resources can be obtained only through use of a password known exclusively to the MCCCD employees, Governing Board members or students. It is those users\u2019 responsibility to keep a password confidential. While MCCCD takes reasonable measures to ensure network security, it cannot be held accountable for unauthorized access to its technology resources by other persons, both within and outside the MCCCD community. Moreover, it cannot guarantee employees, Governing Board members and students protection against reasonable failures. Finally, under certain limited circumstances defined in Administrative Regulation 4.15 \u201CRetrieval, Disclosure and Retention of Records,\u201D certain MCCCD employees are authorized to access information on an MCCCD technology device. It is not Maricopa's practice to monitor the content of electronic mail transmissions, files, images, links or other data stored on or transmitted through Maricopa's technology resources. The maintenance, operation and security of Maricopa's technology resources, however, require that network administrators and other authorized personnel have access to those resources and, on occasion, review the content of data and communications stored on or transmitted through those resources. Any other review may be performed exclusively by persons expressly authorized for such purpose and only for cause. To the extent possible in the electronic environment and in a public setting, a user's privacy will be honored. Nevertheless, that privacy is subject to Arizona's public records laws and other applicable state and federal laws, as well as policies of Maricopa's Governing Board all of which may supersede a user's interests in maintaining privacy in information contained in Maricopa's technology resources. Incidental Computer and Technology Usage Limited incidental personal use of MCCCD technology resources including through use of personal e-mail systems is permitted, except as described in item 16 under \u201CProhibited Conduct.\u201D MCCCD employees are responsible for exercising good judgment about personal use in accordance with this regulation, Colleges\u2019 consistent local guidelines and MCCCD ethical standards. Personal use refers to activities which only affect the individual and that are not related to an employee\u2019s outside business. MCCCD employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner which will not raise concern that they are or might be engaged in acts in violations of the public trust. Refer to the Guidelines for Incidental Computer Usage for the Maricopa Community Colleges (Appendix AS-8) and Guidelines for Incidental Telephone Usage for the Maricopa Community Colleges (Appendix AS-9).
