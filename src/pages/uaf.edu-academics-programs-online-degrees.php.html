Our online college degrees and programs allow you to work around a busy life from anywhere in the world and still get a high-quality education. How Do Online College Classes Work? Before your first semester begins, you\u2019ll want to log in to Canvas (your online course delivery system) and order any books you need for class. If you need to contact your instructor, go to people.alaska.edu to search for their email, phone number or office location. Online courses do not require meeting times, but you will have assignments each week. Courses are designed by your instructor to best teach that subject. You may use blogs, social media, video chat and other technology as part of your online coursework. Some online courses may require you to take proctored exams. If you are outside of Fairbanks, you\u2019ll need to arrange for a local proctor. Otherwise you can take exams at our UAF eCampus Exam Center. You\u2019ll receive progress reports with grade feedback through the mid part of the semester. You can view your midterm grades at UAOnline.
