Since 1984, the Benevolent Fund has worked to meet the needs of UAB employees and our community by offering a unique blend of employee charitable giving opportunities. What began as an effort to consolidate abundant charitable giving efforts across campus has evolved into a multifaceted organization governed by an elected council representing employees from all academic programs, administrative divisions, and UAB Medicine. Today, the Benevolent Fund is an important part of UAB\u2019s Community Engagement Pillar and a leader in forging community partnerships. New initiatives include UAB\u2019s 50 Acts of Service in celebration of UAB\u2019s 50th Anniversary and serving on the BlazerPulse Oversight Committee.
