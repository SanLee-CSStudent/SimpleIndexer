Our bike programs advocate cycling as a means of health, recreation, and transportation. We seek to make cycling an accessible activity for everyone and to create a bike friendly community. To do this, we provide quality, affordable bikes, parts, and repair services; we offer educational and instructional opportunities to the community about bike safety, repair, and maintenance.

It's fast, efficient, and because it uses no fuel it practically pays for itself in a few weeks. No more searching for parking spaces or walking to class. With bike racks on campus and next to most buildings, Lyon College offers an ideal environment for cyclists to rove campus. Lyon College is part of Fuji University, a program that seeks to make bicycles readily available to students, faculty, staff, and alumni of colleges and universities across the United States. Lyon students, faculty, staff, and alumni are able to purchase a quality made bike at a discounted rate through our bike shop. Please stop by our shop to discuss this benefit in more detail with one of our knowledgeable staff. Below are examples of different bike styles we offer: Cruiser\/Comfort: These bikes are designed for comfort. They are great for campus, local travel, and vacation. Bikes are available in both the traditional frame style and the step-through frame style for easy on and off. Hybrid\/Commuter: These bikes offer a more upright riding position and have easier pedaling. They are great for quick, efficient trips on campus and local travels, as well as for longer rides and have tires with more grip than a road bike, but less than a mountain bike for lighter but durable riding on paved roads. Mountain\/Sport: These bikes have a less upright riding position and tires with more aggressive treads. Whether traveling on campus or on trails they can take you anywhere. Some options have front suspension while others have a more traditional rigid frame. Urban: These bikes are designed for the urban dweller who navigates the busy streets of their city, with frequent starts and stops on paved terrain. This style is made to be light and these bikes have either fixed gears or are single speed. Road: These bikes offer quick handling, responsive shifting and braking, and have a less upright riding position. They are quick and light in getting you around campus and across long distances. They are designed more for performance, speed, and distance. Shop Services Our shop mainly services mountain and road bikes owned by students and community members, as well as older cruiser style bikes. Generally, flat tires take about a half hour. Small repairs and tune-ups can typically be completed in a day. Major repairs or specific part replacements typically take three to four days to complete. We will let you know the expected wait time when you bring your bike into the shop. Below is an overview of the most common services we provide. Prices below indicate the cost of labor. Cost of parts is separate. Services Fill Tires with Air FREE Bearing Adjustment $15 Bearing Repacked $20 Brake Adjustment $5 Gear Adjustment $5 Tube Replacement $5 Clean & Lube Chain $20 Wrap Bars $10 True Wheel $10 New Cable $5 New Housing $5 Bike Build $25-$75 Free Assessment Mechanics perform a complete assessment on every bike that comes into the shop for repairs. Assessments are free, and an essential part of the repair process. Often, one problem can influence additional problems. When we can assess and understand the functioning of the bike as a whole, we can provide a better and longer lasting repair service. Whether you have a specific concern or just want to know the condition of the bike from your garage, we will assess all aspects of your bike and give you an estimate at any time. Mechanics will assess all bikes for condition of parts including but not limited to: Pedal and Crank Damage and Wear Chain Damage, Dirt, Breakage Shifters Hanger & Derailleurs, Cable Wear, Ease of Shifting Bottom Bracket Grinding or Looseness Frame & Seat Breakage, Bends, or Rust Wheels & Tires Puncture, Rot, Debris, Warp, Wobble, or Grinding Brakes Cable & Pad Wear and Adjustment, Lever Damage Tune-Ups Bicycle tune ups are recommended on an annual basis or every 1,000-3,000 miles. For those who ride in the winter, a spring tune up is important no matter how many miles you've ridden; salt, grime, and moisture can cause rust to build up throughout your bike. Tune ups can help improve your bike's ride, shifting, and speed. From a Mini Tune-Up to a Mother-Overhaul, we have something to fit every budget to get you cycling smoothly in no time. Mini Tune-Up $35.00 Brakes Levers Lubricated and Secured Calipers Lubricated and Centered Pad Alignment and Wear Checked Shifters Levers Inspected and Secured Cables Lubricated and Adjusted Chain Clean & Lubricate Frame & Seat Secured or Repositioned Miscellaneous Crank Arms, Chain Ring, Bolts, and Pedals Secured All Accessory Mountings Secured Full Tune-Up $55.00 Full Tune-Up Includes all Services in Mini Tune-Up with the Addition of: Bottom Bracket Repacked and Greased Hub & Headset Hub Adjustment and Headset Adjustment Wheels Trued Freewheel Lubricated Brake & Shifter Cable and Housing Replaced (cost of parts is included) Lyon College Start Your Future Lyon is more than just a college.
