Many Blazers qualify for financial assistance. Complete these three steps to ensure you\u2019re considered for any aid available to you. Step 1. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) The only way to know for sure if you qualify for financial aid is to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Be sure to use UAB\u2019s school code 001052 to ensure your information is sent to us. Many families find they can use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT), which allows tax filers to import IRS data directly into the FAFSA. Using the IRS DRT reduces the risk of errors and makes completing the FAFSA faster and more secure.

Review your Student Aid Report (SAR) from the U.S. Department of Education Once you submit your FAFSA, the Department of Education is typically able to process it within 3-5 business days. You will receive your FAFSA results via your Student Aid Report. We encourage you to review your SAR to ensure the information you submitted on the FAFSA is accurate and complete. Step 3. Verify your FAFSA was received by UAB Upon submitting your FAFSA to UAB, the Financial Aid Office will receive and process your FAFSA beginning in November or within 3-5 business days of completing your FAFSA and sending your information to UAB. You can verify receipt of your FAFSA on the My Financial Aid tab of BlazerNET. Please note that you must be admitted to the University for your FAFSA to be processed. Step 4. Complete any additional financial aid application requirements through BlazerNET Approximately 30% of students are selected by the U.S. Department of Education to complete a process known as verification. FAFSA verification ensures that the information we have on file for you is accurate and complete and that you are considered for the full amount of federal financial aid for which you are eligible. You can find helpful verification resources and information on the FAFSA Verification page. Students should also complete the Resource Information Form to indicate any assistance they expect to receive from outside sources, including UAB Departmental Scholarships, UAB Educational Assistance, Alabama GI Dependent benefits, Alabama Vocational Rehabilitation benefits, Graduate Assistantship, or State Scholarships, etc. Students are not required to submit the form if they will not receive additional assistance but are encouraged to indicate \u201Cno other assistance\u201D on the form to prevent additional notifications.
