(Like late at night.) TheSIS: How can I access my TheSIS account? You may access TheSIS by going to the header area of most BSC webpages and clicking MyBSC and choosing TheSIS from the dropdown choices. NOTE: If you have tried too many times to log into TheSIS with an incorrect username or password, the system will lock you out for 10 minutes. If you try again during that 10-minute interval, the clock will be reset. You must wait 10 complete minutes. MyBudget in TheSIS Here is the screen displayed initially that allows you to select your perspective in TheSIS. Employees From this screen you'll notice 2 options under Financial Information. Budget selection allows you to specify the selection criteria for reporting. Budget summary displays the account information that you have available with the appropriate links to drill down into the details. Notice all underlined words in the TheSIS menus represent links to which one can find more information. This is true the deeper you progress into the screens as well. Budget Selection The major points of interest on this screen are the Save GL Component Selection checkbox and the Fiscal Year drop down box. Save GL Component Selection allows one to enter the normal account subsets most often used so they may be retained. Once they are saved you only have to visit this screen to make changes. This will speed up the process during subsequent visits by allowing you to go directly to the Summary Screen, as it uses this information to locate the data presented. Fiscal Year is now in a drop down box, which allows for years other than the current open year to be viewed. While only one year at a time can be viewed it is extremely helpful to be able to view the past year, for example, during the time of transition into a new budget. Notice in the example given that the Funds, Departments and Objects can all be specified. If you leave the object blank, all accounts for the department(s) selected will be returned. The Projects item is not utilized currently and may be ignored. Up to 5 different items in each category may be used and wildcard selecting is also possiblem, subject to the access security that one has been given. In this case the wildcard of 7 is used in the Objects item to only return accounts whose object code begins with a 7. Notice that no (\u2026) ellipses are used here like in the GUI screens for wildcarding. Budget Summary Here is where the added drill down capability begins to be apparent. Notice again on this screen as before where underlined items exist. They provide a link to find more details. By simply pointing to the underlined item and clicking the mouse, you can get more data. The Budgeted, Requisitioned, Encumbered and Actual columns all can be detailed into. A couple of examples follow on the next pages showing the level of detail. You will be able to see the purchase order and even down to the invoice level or as far back as the requisition. Actuals Voucher Troubleshooting As with all systems there are times when problems will occur and this one is no different. As you come across issues, please report them to the helpdesk at x3033 option 2 so we may address them. Timekeeping: Employees \u2013 How do I log my work hours and vacation time?
