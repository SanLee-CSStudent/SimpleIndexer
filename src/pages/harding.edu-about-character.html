This unique designation followed the passage of a resolution by the university's board of trustees, declaring that Harding would do everything possible to promote character on campus and beyond. Harding is taking a leadership role with its students and community to demonstrate the importance of good character. By working to strengthen character in its students, the university intends to help students make good decisions throughout their lives. Training Character is best taught by example. Leaders who model good character influence others to develop good character by recognizing, requiring and emphasizing proper attitudes, words and actions. In its commitment to the Character First! model, Harding's student services personnel and resident assistants completed the curriculum and are taking leadership roles in the dormitories and on campus, working to resolve conflicts before they have a chance to surface in wrong actions. Their leadership guides others to focus on these character traits as they make daily decisions leading to a high quality of life.
