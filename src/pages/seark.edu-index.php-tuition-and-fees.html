The charge is based on the clock hours of instruction, the supplies and materials required, and the fee of the instructor. Arkansas residents who are 60 years of age and older are entitled to attend college credit classes at Southeast Arkansas College and other state colleges and universities without a tuition charge. Proof of age must be presented at the time of registration. This waiver does not apply to non-credit classes, assessment fees, or any other fee collected by the college. Senior citizens are responsible for acquiring books and supplies. Cost of Materials Books, tools, uniforms, supplies, etc., are required in most courses. Instructors will give students a list of needed items on the first day of class. Total cost of materials for a full-time student will depend upon the program of study. Payment of Tuition and Fees Students may not attend classes until they have paid tuition and fees in full, set-up a payment plan through Nelnet or made definite arrangements concerning Financial Aid with a Financial Aid Officer located in College Hall North. This applies to all students, including recipients of Pell, WIOA, NAFTA\/TAA, Scholarships, Rehab, Veteran's benefits, and other types of aid. Payments in full (no partial payments accepted) can be made at the cashier\u2019s office via Visa, MasterCard and Personal Checks. Check payments that are subsequently returned for insufficient funds will be assessed a return service fee. Any student account that remains unpaid at the end of the semester and is not paid within thirty (30) days may be turned over to an outside collection agency for assistance in collecting. A collection cost will be added to the amount owed by the student to cover the collection agency cost. Unpaid account balances may also be sent to the state utilizing the Debt-Set Off program which deducts amounts due the College from an individual's tax return. Tuition Deferred Payment Agreement\/Payment Plans All students are expected to have payment arrangements (including financial aid) in place at the time of registration, or he\/she will be dropped from classes.

Payment Plan Overview Payment Plan Calendar Students are encouraged to register as early as possible in order to secure their desired schedule and to avoid long lines and\/or closed classes. All students should consult with their advisors prior to registration. Students are required to make an appointment with their advisor and come prepared to discuss class needs as they apply to their programs of study. However, remember that most faculty are not available for advising during the breaks between terms, so care should be taken when scheduling appointments.
