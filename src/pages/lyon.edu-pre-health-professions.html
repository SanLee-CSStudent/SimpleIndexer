Student Spotlight \u201CLyon\u2019s small student-to-teacher ratio allowed me and my fellow classmates to receive the attention and support we otherwise wouldn\u2019t receive in a bigger college,\u201D said Javier Moreno, \u201915, a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D) candidate attending the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock. \u201CMy education at Lyon was rigorous, and the professors allowed much of it to be self-driven,\u201D said Lauren Gunderman, \u201916, Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.) candidate attending the University of Tennessee College of Dentistry in Memphis. \u201CWhen I got to dental school, I found that this put me above some of my classmates simply because I knew how to take what we were presented and fill in any gaps.\u201D Careers for Health Majors Lyon College can help students prepare for careers such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, dentists, optometrists, veterinarians, pharmacists, and medical doctors.
