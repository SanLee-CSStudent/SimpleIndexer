This institute provides employers with skilled personnel ready to practice in the area of surgical technology. Students in this field possess the knowledge required to take and pass the national certification test prior to graduation. We believe that every individual is unique and that it is our responsibility to help fulfill each individual\u2019s accountability to self and mankind. There are two educations: one teaches us how to earn a living and the other teaches us how to live. We subscribe to the belief that technical education is an essential part of both. We believe that a strong work ethic is one of our best means of developing the intelligent use of the hands and the mind. The patient is the central focus of our care. Our primary goal is to teach the student to respect the confidentiality, privacy and dignity of each individual while providing care and a safe environment for the patient. Students will demonstrate proficient technical skills prior to entering into a clinical rotation. Upon successful completion of the program, all of the program objectives will be met. These students may achieve competence requirements for national certification by the National Board of Surgical Technology and Surgical Assisting.
