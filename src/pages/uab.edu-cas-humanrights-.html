More than 60 years after the adoption of the UN\u2019s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the gap continues to widen between rights conferred by law and the daily realities for many around the world. Human rights concerns are at the core of our societal issues and affect human beings worldwide. Vulnerable populations are confronted by serious human rights violations, frequently unchecked and en masse, and continue to struggle for dignity, equality, and freedom. The UAB Institute for Human Rights serves as a permanent location where scholars, educators, and activists come together and collaborate on initiatives designed to promote and protect human rights in an increasingly complex and globalized landscape. The IHR integrates existing university and community strengths and capacities with a global outlook, focusing on the use of innovative technologies and scientific methods to create and foster new research, policy solutions, educational programming, and outreach activities relating to all aspects of human rights. The IHR is a part of the UAB College of Arts and Sciences and located on the 5th floor of UAB\u2019s Heritage Hall. ihr@uab.edu (p) 205.934.5643 (f) 205.934.9896 Heritage Hall Rm. 551 1401 University Boulevard Birmingham, AL 35294 College of Arts and Sciences Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
