{"id":297,"title":"Title IX Policies & Procedures","url":"https:\/\/www.jbu.edu\/title-ix\/","content":"Title IX Policies & Procedures Sexual Assault, Dating & Domestic Violence, Stalking & Harassment Policy Title Ix The University is committed to the preservation of human dignity, and is particularly concerned about the possibility of harassment, whether sexual, racial, ethnic, or any other type. This applies to all members of the JBU community including but not limited to students, employees, and third parties. Harassment in any form - verbal, physical, or visual - is strictly against University policy and will result in immediate disciplinary action. Harassment of any type is strictly prohibited. It is a violation of state and local law and University regulations to commit a sexual assault (including rape). JBU Title IX Policy Title IX Taskforce Training CCCU Title IX Training - Part One CCCU Title IX Training - Part Two ATIXA Training Materials Thompson Coburn Title IX Training Series REPORTING AN OFFENSE If a sex offense, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking has occurred there are several options: Emergency Response: Contact your local crisis center. Northwest Arkansas\/Siloam Springs Area \u2013 NWA Center for Sexual Assault 24\/7 Hotline: 1-800-794-4175. This is an advocacy agency that offers free services (including a sexual assault forensic medical exam) at all hours. This option is highly suggested. Fort Smith Area \u2013 Crisis Intervention Center 24\/7 Hotline: 1-800-359-0056 Little Rock Area \u2013 Center for Healing Hearts & Spirits Crisis Hotline: 1-855-643-5748 Contact police (from the area where the assault happened). Go to a primary care physician. If the assault happened in the past, you can follow up with a primary care physician. Campus Reporting: Contact the Title IX Coordinator: Amy Fisher 479.524.7128 Chapman 26; TitleIXCoordinator@jbu.edu Contact Campus Safety at 479-215-5000 (24\/7) or, to report anonymously, fill out this online form. Protective Measures The reporting party may request and may receive protective measures such as changes in academic, living, transportation, and working situations, if such accommodations are reasonably available regardless of whether the incident is reported to campus safety or local law enforcement. These may include, but are not limited to, providing an escort between classes, moving residence halls, providing academic services, and changing work positions or time schedules. If a reporting party feels the need for a legal protective order, please see this link for instructions on how to do so: http:\/\/www.arlegalservices.org\/node\/804\/fact-sheets Once there, scroll down to \u201COrder of Protection Packet.\u201D The reporting party can also contact a Title IX Co-Coordinator or Campus Safety for assistance. ADVERSE OR THREATENING ACTIONS BY RESPONDENT OR THIRD PARTY Behavior which is deemed to be harassment, intimidation, or threats by other parties is not considered retaliation under Title IX but is still serious. When needed, the institution will assist any party in attaining protective measures, no contact orders, restraining orders, or similar lawful orders. Furthermore, if any party experiences adverse or threatening behavior from other students or third parties, it could be the basis of another Title IX complaint or University disciplinary action. If you are experiencing adverse or threatening behavior because of a Title IX complaint, contact one of the Title IX Co-Coordinators with documents, recordings, emails, calls, or any information related to the behavior. RETALIATION Under Title IX, only the institution\u2019s conduct toward any party qualifies as retaliation. The institution will not only take steps to prevent retaliation on its part toward any party but will also take strong responsive action if it occurs. Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or discrimination or for participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this policy. Acts of retaliation should be reported immediately to one of the Title IX Co-Coordinators and will be promptly investigated and addressed. Title IX Coordinator: Amy Fisher 479.524.7128 Chapman 26 TitleIXCoordinator@jbu.edu DEFINITIONS Harassment includes, but is not limited to: slurs, threats, derogatory comments, unwelcome jokes, teasing or sexual advances that create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment, unreasonably interferes with an individual\u2019s performance or otherwise negatively affects an individual\u2019s opportunities. Sexual assault is attempted or unwanted sexual activity, including rape. (See consent section.) Domestic violence includes offenses committed by someone the victim is or has been married to or cohabitated with, or person similarly situated (i.e. roommate, sibling, etc.). Dating violence is violence by a person who has been in a romantic or intimate relationship with the victim. Stalking is conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for her, his, or others\u2019 safety, or to suffer substantial emotional distress. Exploitation occurs when an individual takes sexual advantage of another person for his\/her own or others\u2019 benefit. UNDERSTANDING CONSENT Conduct of a sexual nature is unwelcome or nonconsensual if it is offensive or not requested or invited. Silence, acquiescence, or failure to complain prior to or during the conduct does not imply that the conduct is welcome or consensual. Coercing someone into sexual activity violates this policy in the same way as physically forcing someone into sex. Coercion happens when someone is pressured unreasonably for sex. When alcohol or other drugs are being used, a person will be considered unable to give valid consent if they cannot fully understand the details of a sexual interaction (who, what, when, where, why or how) because they lack the capacity to reasonably understand the situation. Individuals who consent to sex must be able to understand what they are doing. NOTICE OF NONDISCRIMINATION OR NONRETALIATION The law and the policies of John Brown University prohibit disparate treatment on the basis of sex or any other protected characteristic, with regard to terms, conditions, privileges and perquisites of attendance. The prohibitions against harassment and retaliation are intended to complement and further those policies, not to form the basis of an exception to them. The prohibited sex discrimination covers sexual harassment, sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking (see definitions below). Inquiries concerning the application of non-discrimination, Violence Against Women Act and the Campus Crime Act may be referred to the Title IX Co-Coordinators, currently Andr? Broquard or Amy Fisher, at TitleIXCoordinator@jbu.edu. Complaints may also be reported in person at 2000 W University, Siloam Springs, AR 72761 or by calling 479.524.7229 or 479.524.7128. 2000 W.
