The test consists of two sections and assesses a student's achievement level in writing and mathematics. ACCUPLACER is not a timed test and is administered via computer. This assessment tool helps determine your level of preparedness for college-level work. Placement tests can help you and your advisor plan the best set of courses for your career goals and skill level. Placement tests can also help determine whether you're ready for more advanced course work and may allow you to place out of required courses. You'll want to do your very best on the tests, since this could possibly reduce the number of courses you'll have to take to obtain your degree. Scheduling: After an application for admission is received in the Admissions Office, a student will receive instructions in their admissions email for scheduling a date and time to complete the ACCUPLACER placement test. There is no fee for the test. However, a picture ID is required for identity purposes. Please contact the Admissions Office if you have any questions.
