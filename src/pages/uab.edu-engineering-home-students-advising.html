Students must have a Registration Access Code (RAC) in order to register for courses. RACs will be given to students only after meeting with their advisor. All academic advising within the School of Engineering is conducted by engineering professors. Questions about financial aid, housing, and other topics should also be directed to One Stop. Prospective Undergraduate Students If you are interested in becoming an engineering student and would like to speak with an advisor in our Office of Academic Programs (OAP) located in the Dean\u2019s Office, you may use the buttons below to schedule an appointment, or you may call 205-934-8400 for assistance. Current Undergraduate Students First-Term and Pre-Engineering Students First-term students and all pre-engineering majors must meet with an advisor in the OAP prior to being admitted to a major. You can schedule an appointment using the buttons below. Sabrina Calhoun advises pre-engineering students with last name starting with A-K except students seeking a second undergraduate degree Dr. Zoe Dwyer advises all pre-engineering students with last name starting with L-Z and all post-baccalaureate or second-degree students Students with majors in Biomedical, Civil, Electrical, Engineering Design, Materials, or Mechanical Engineering When you have met all requirements to enter one of the five engineering programs, your advising will be conducted in your new department. You are encouraged to set an appointment for next semester's academic advising early in the current semester. Contact your department directly by calling the appropriate number: Department of Biomedical Engineering: (205) 996-0165 Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering: (205) 934-8430 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering: (205) 934-8440 Department of Materials Science and Engineering (205) 934-8450 Department of Mechanical Engineering: (205) 934-8460 Engineering Student Advising Four-year Programs of Study Biomedical Engineering Civil Engineering Electrical Engineering Engineering Design Materials Engineering Mechanical Engineering Prerequisite Flowcharts for Engineering Majors Biomedical Engineering Civil Engineering Electrical Engineering Engineering Design Materials Engineering Mechanical Engineering Graduate Students Graduate students are advised by faculty in their program. All students must have a Registration Access Code (RAC) in order to register for courses. RACs will only be given after meeting with the advisor. If you have questions, please contact your graduate program director. INTO UAB Students If you are graduating from Pathways to an engineering department, you should contact your department's graduate program director at least four weeks before the end of the semester. The director will advise you on courses for the upcoming semester as well as proposed thesis topics (if applicable). UAB's International Admissions Department will readmit you to degree-seeking status (after verifying you meet all progression requirements) within two days of official grades being posted. After you are readmitted, you must receive a Registration Access Code (RAC) from your engineering advisor, and then you will register yourself in courses. You will not receive a Registration Access Code (RAC) until you have met with your advisor. Your INTO UAB Advisors will email you with important progression dates and information that you should refer to during this process. If you do not meet progression requirements, you will receive an email from your INTO UAB Advisor with instructions. Students Admissions Why UAB?
