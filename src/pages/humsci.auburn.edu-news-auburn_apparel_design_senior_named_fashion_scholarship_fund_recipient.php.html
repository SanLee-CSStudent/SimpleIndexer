Auburn University College of Human Sciences senior Tori Hogan was recently named a scholar for the Fashion Scholarship Fund for her success as a fashion design visionary and gained a once-in-a-lifetime experience in New York as a scholarship recipient. Hogan, who is majoring in apparel merchandising, design and production management with an emphasis in apparel design, represented one of 123 scholarship recipients from across the nation and was the only student to represent Auburn University in the class of 2022. As a Fashion Scholarship Fund recipient, Hogan was treated to a three-day, all expenses paid trip to New York City where she met some of the biggest and brightest names in the design, merchandising, marketing analytics and supply chain industry and was awarded a $7,500 scholarship. Hogan, along with close to 30 other winners in the design category, met leaders from Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Louis Vuitton, Vogue and more while also attending a Gala fundraising celebration at the Glasshouse in New York City on April 11. \u201CThe Gala was the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201D Hogan said. \u201CIt was at the Glasshouse in New York City on the Hudson River with a beautiful skyline with beautiful marble floors, three DJs, the creative director of Louis Vuitton was there, the editor-in-chief of Vogue and it was just amazing. The people I got to talk to and getting to see my project there was just the coolest experience that I\u2019ll never forget.\u201D The project Hogan is referring to is her case study she worked on last year as part of the submission process for the Fashion Scholarship Fund. Hogan\u2019s case study allowed her to earn one hour of credit where she blended the Fabletics brand with Target retail stores to create an \u201CAthletics to the Office wardrobe\u201D where she was advised and encouraged by Dr. Karla Teel to take on the case study and apply for the Fashion Scholarship Fund. \u201CI did a collaboration between Target and Fabletics and utilized Fabletics materials at a lower price point to provide the same day pick-up that Target has,\u201D Hogan said. \u201CI also focused on size inclusivity and being able to wear work wear in the office and when you\u2019re working out.\u201D In addition to the case study, Hogan completed an internship in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. at Montce Swimwear where she learned pre-production and product development, quality control, fit testing, sewing seams, working in Photoshop for e-commerce and more. Hogan also owns her own online business called \u201CLove, Always\u201D and was recently named in the top four for Auburn University\u2019s Student Employee of the Year. Originally from Maryland, Hogan wanted to go into an industry that uses creativity and she feels that clothing is a great way to express yourself. With an abundance of colleges and design schools to choose from, Hogan chose Auburn. \u201CSomeone actually asked me, \u2018Why did you choose Auburn over going to a design school?\u2019 and I said I wanted a college well-rounded experience with a top design program,\u201D Hogan said. \u201CI fell in love with Auburn and the Auburn Family is true. I wouldn\u2019t trade the experiences, the mentorships, the professors and anything I\u2019ve done here for the world. Auburn has made me become who I am, not only what I can do but they\u2019ve also shown me who I want to become.\u201D Following graduation in May, Hogan isn\u2019t 100 percent sure where she\u2019ll end up to begin her career but she is sure it will be in the fashion industry. \u201CIt\u2019s to be determined but I\u2019m going through the interview process right now and I\u2019m definitely going to head into the fashion industry,\u201D Hogan said.
