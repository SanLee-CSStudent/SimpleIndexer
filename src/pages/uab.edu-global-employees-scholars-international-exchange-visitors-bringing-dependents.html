J-1 dependents hold J-2 status. Each dependent must apply separately for an individual visa. Coming to the US for the first time Before you apply for a J-2 DS-2019 for your dependents, please consider the following: They should only apply for a J-2 visa if they plan to stay with you for the entire duration of your J 1 program. If they will not, they should apply for a B1\/B2 Tourist visa or ESTA to come visit you. They must have valid health insurance for the entire duration of their J-2 DS-2019, even if they are not in the US. They will be subject to the same repeat participation bars and two years home residency requirement than you. Your dependents will need their own individual Forms DS-2019s to apply for their first visa to enter the US. A section of our Background Information Form is reserved to collect information about your dependents. But, if you wish to add them later on, we will need the following: Copies of passport(s) biographical page(s) Copies of child(ren)\u2019s birth certificate(s) and English translation Copy of marriage certificate and English translation From all, the following details: city of birth, country of birth, country of citizenship, and country of legal permanent residence. Once we have the necessary documents, ISSS Office will issue your dependent\u2019s DS-2019. The dates listed will be the same as yours. They will also need to complete and submit a From DS-160, pay the necessary visa fees, and go to a visa interview, either at the same time as you, or separately. Your dependents can then enter the US with their own J-2 visa, their original DS-2019s and a copy of your DS-2019. For the type of documents requested for the interview, please see \"Minimum Supporting Documents requested\" under Receiving your DS-2019 and booking a visa appointment. Employment Authorization Document for J-2 Spouses Your J-2 spouse can apply for work authorization in the US by filing a Form I-765 with USCIS. When the Form I-765 is approved, USCIS will mail your spouse a plastic work card known as \u201CEAD\u201D or \u201CEmployment Authorization Document\u201D. Without this work card, your spouse cannot work in the US and will not be eligible for a Social Security Number (SSN). If your spouse does not want to work in the US, your spouse can request an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the Social Security Administration for health insurance and tax purposes. Dependents can also obtain an Alabama driver's license and enroll in classes part-time or full-time. J-2 dependent\u2019s income from the work must not be for the support of the primary J-1 to whom the J-2 is related. J-2s may work only if the income is to be used for their own support (and perhaps that of other people in the family). Procedure: To apply for work authorization as a J-2 visa holder, assemble the following documents: Completed Form I-765 (available on USCIS website). Please be sure to download the Form from USCIS website to get the most recent one. The edition date of the form is listed at the bottom of the form.
