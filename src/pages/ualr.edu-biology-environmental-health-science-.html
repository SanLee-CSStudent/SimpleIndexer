Contact Form The B.S. degree in Environmental Health Sciences program is designed to prepare students for a broad range of career opportunities in the environmental profession. With a total of 26 hours of approved electives, students can focus on their individual career objective. Although the curriculum prepares students to be immediately competitive for environmental employment upon graduation, it also emphasizes research and creates a foundation for those seeking graduate degrees in the environmental field. Employment opportunities are available both in the public and private sectors. Courses within the curriculum emphasize development of environmental skills in both field and laboratory settings. These environmental skills include permitting, impact analysis, restoration ecology, sampling, computer modeling, epidemiology, planning, energy analysis, toxicology, risk assessment, research methods, information dissemination, and best management practices. Both cooperative education and internship experiences are available for majors. A student chapter of the National Association of Environmental Professionals provides opportunities for professional growth and community services involvement. Admissions Requirements To major in environmental health sciences a student must have completed the following: A minimum of 15 credit hours at UALR with a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or better. Completion of ENHS 2320 & ENHS 2120 \u2013 Introduction to Environmental Health Sciences with a grade of C or better. Decisions regarding course equivalency and situations in which students have tested out of courses or transferred credit from other programs will be made by the program director. Combined Major-Minor in Environmental Health Sciences and Biology The B.S. degree in Environmental Health Sciences is a combined major-minor in Environmental Health Sciences and Biology. Therefore, a minor is not required for the Environmental Health Sciences major, but a separate minor can still be selected. Requirements for the Environmental Health Sciences major include the following: (1) Basic Sciences \u2013 29 credit hours; (2) Core \u2013 11 credit hours; (3) Environmental Media \u2013 6 credit hours; (4) Environmental Analysis and Risk Assessment \u2013 8 credit hours; (5) Biology Electives (Approved) \u2013 11 credit hours; and (6) General Electives (Approved) \u2013 15 credit hours. Minor in Environmental Health Sciences A minor in Environmental Health Sciences requires 18 credit hours, including ENHS 2320, Introduction to Environmental Health Sciences, ENHS 2120, Introduction to Environmental Health Sciences Laboratory, and ENHS 3310, Environmental Regulations. A grade of \u201CC\u201D or better is required for both ENHS 2320 and ENHS 2120 prior to enrollment in any upper level ENHS courses. The remaining 11 credit hours are course electives from the ENHS program. Elective hours must be approved by the Program Director.
