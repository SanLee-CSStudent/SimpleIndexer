Luke HarlanIn helping to bring HBO\u2019s \u201CThe Gilded Age\u201D to life, Luke Harlan used many of the skills he learned in school \u2014 including his time at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. A director and producer for TV, film and theater, Harlan is a 2008 graduate of the College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 Department of Theatre, which he credits for giving him the chance to learn a varied skillset. Harlan earned his Master of Fine Arts degree in directing from the Yale School of Drama. Harlan has helped to shape the sumptuous new series, set in booming 1882 New York City. His role as part of the producing team of the show \u2014 written and created by Julian Fellowes of \u201CDownton Abbey\u201D and \u201CGosford Park\u201D \u2014 depended on where it was in production: as an assistant to the director and executive producer, and more recently as co-producer. During pre-production, he operated much like a dramaturg, he says, overseeing the production\u2019s research team and working closely with the writers to maintain historical accuracy, and helping to navigate the 50-plus character storylines going at any time. It is \u201Ca very large undertaking,\u201D he said, \u201Cto juggle so many characters and keep their stories moving\u201D over the course of an entire season (and even multiple seasons) and to fill out the show\u2019s world with detail and precision. During production, Harlan was more hands-on with the directors and actors. He was \u201Con set every day watching closely to be sure that what we are capturing on camera [was] what was intended, as well as coordinating with the many different design and technical departments on world-building. Courtesy of HBO \"The Gilded Age\" \u201CDuring post-production, I get to work with yet many more incredible artists, from editors to sound designers and composers, to visual effects artists, to help guide the episode into its final stages and on to screens,\u201D Harlan said. Prior to this, Harlan worked on film and TV projects including \u201CThe Irishman,\u201D \u201CJoker,\u201D \u201CThe Chaperone\u201D and \u201CSaturday Night Live,\u201D as well as producing and directing multiple short films including the award-winning \u201CWhite Flags,\u201D which was screened at 15 festivals nationwide. In New York theater, he directed the New York Times\u2019 Critic\u2019s Pick \u201CHonky\u201D by Greg Kalleres and co-wrote and performed in the New York Times Critic\u2019s Pick \u201Chome\/sick\u201D by The Assembly. He developed new plays at The Public Theater, New York Theater Workshop, Tectonic Theater Project, The New Group, The Kennedy Center, Columbia University and the O\u2019Neill Theater Center, among others. His awards and recognitions include winner of the Opera America Robert L. Tobin Director-Designer Showcase 2017, member of the T.S. Eliot US\/UK Exchange and a Eugene O\u2019Neill Center Directing fellow. At Yale School of Drama, he directed more than 15 productions. \u201CI always look back on my time at UAB as formative for my artistic career,\u201D Harlan said. \u201CThe program gave me space to learn so many different skills, from set and lighting design to stage managing, to costume building, just as much as acting and directing.\u201D Courtesy of HBO \"The Gilded Age\" It was at UAB that Harlan found his passion for directing. During his time with Theatre UAB, Harlan directed \u201CThe Laramie Project\u201D as the first student to direct a mainstage production. He returned in 2017, as an alumnus, to direct \u201CVinegar Tom.\u201D While still a student, he won the National Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers Directing Award at the national Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival in Washington, D.C. \u201CThat is a testament to my teachers who believed in me and encouraged me to always go farther and dream bigger,\u201D he said. People working toward a career in theater, or the arts, should vary their studies. \u201CI would encourage students, no matter what their particular pursuit is, to branch out and learn other skills that interest them,\u201D Harlan said. \u201CBecause, as I have learned very well, you never know where life will take you. Stay open, be kind, and follow your passion.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
