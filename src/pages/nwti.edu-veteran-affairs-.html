Eligibility and equivalent educational benefits are determined by the Veterans Administration (VA). The office of the Certifying Official coordinates NWTI\u2019s services to the students attending classes and receiving veteran\u2019s educational benefits. The Certifying Official collects, completes and processes the required substantiating documentation. In addition, the Certifying Official offers information about services on campus to assist with educational, career, personal and financial concerns. The office also serves as a point-of-contact and direct liaison between the veteran, the School and the Veterans Administration. The certifying official is not part of the Veterans Administration, but an employee of Northwest Technical Institute. Eligibility To be eligible for educational benefits, a student must be admitted to a curriculum program and have high school transcripts, all college transcripts, a copy of his\/her DD214, a request for educational benefits, and admissions documents on file with the School\u2019s Certifying Official. Application for Veteran\u2019s Benefits VA applications are designed to obtain the necessary information to determine your eligibility for educational assistance. Student may apply for education benefits at any time. Information regarding eligibility, applications, and certification may be obtained from the Veterans Administration (1.888.GI.BILL.1).

Veterans and eligible dependents will receive notification of this action in the form of a Certificate of Eligibility. This certificate will indicate the type of benefit you are entitled to, the number of months you have to use your benefit and the date your benefit will expire. Northwest Technical Institute\u2019s Certifying Official will need a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility to certify the student\u2019s school attendance. Tuition and Fees Northwest Technical Institute requires all students receiving VA benefits to make arrangements for payment of tuition and fees before the certifying official will certify enrollment at the School. Enrollment Certification Northwest Technical Institute\u2019s Certifying Official reports all the information regarding a student\u2019s enrollment to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Any changes in enrollment are electronically submitted to the VA. Students receiving benefits under Chapter 30, 1606 and 1607 are required to confirm their enrollment status to the VA at the end of each month. No paperwork will automatically be prepared and forwarded to the Veterans Administration for processing and payment without the student\u2019s request. Audits, Withdrawals, Non-required Courses and Repeating a Course The VA prohibits payment for any course that is not required for graduation. This includes repeats of a grade \u201CD\u201D or better (unless a higher grade is required), withdrawals. This does not apply for courses that you failed and must have for graduation. If you are unsure if a class can be certified, please contact our offices at 1 (479) 751-8824 ext. 240.

Several different methods are used to collect over-payments. A statement of mitigating circumstances and supportive documentation may need to be submitted to the Veterans Administration. Satisfactory Academic Progress The Veterans Administration regulations, 38 CFR Section 21.4253 (d) (4) require all VA students to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress while attending an education institution. All students receiving education benefits from the VA are required to maintain academic progress according to the standards established by Northwest Technical Institute. Northwest Technical Institute\u2019s Standards of Progress are submitted to its accrediting agency, Council on Occupation Education, and the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs. Students who do not maintain satisfactory progress will have their benefits discounted and\/or suspended and the Certifying Official will inform the VA of this action. The VA will determine the conditions for reinstatement of benefits. General Information The Veterans Administration Educational Benefits are paid on a monthly basis.
