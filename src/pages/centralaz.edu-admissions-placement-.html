Placement Options Placement Options Placement tools assist incoming CAC students in selecting appropriate level courses. Using one or more of the options below, along with talking to your academic advisor, appropriate course placement is determined. Multiple Measure Placement Tool CAC uses two guided placement tools for students to determine which English\/Reading and Math courses are best for them. The English\/Reading and Math placement tools use multiple measures (factors) to help with suggested course placements. These measures typically include: High School G.P.A. (if student has graduated within 3 years) Self-reported standardized Test Scores listed below (In some instances, students may need to provide those results to their Academic Advisor.) GED (General Education Development) certificate AZ Merit score Accuplacer Next Gen score SAT (spring 2016 or later) score ACT score Advanced Placement (AP) score College Level Examination Program (CLEP) score Cambridge International Exam score International Baccalaureate (IB) score Students will be able to view their suggested course placements upon completion of the Placement Tools. Students should bring the recommendations with them when meeting with an Academic Advisor. Students may need to enroll in Foundational level courses to help gain the academic skills necessary for success at the college level. In some instances, or if desired, students may also take a Skills Assessment in English\/Reading or Math to help determine the best placement. The Skills Assessments include a number of questions designed to gauge students\u2019 suggested exposure or experiences in English, Reading and Math skills. Option #1: Placement Tools (Do this First) English & Reading Placement Tool Mathematics Placement Tool You will receive the results when you complete the Placement Tool. Bring any placement results to your advising meeting. Option #2: Skills Assessments CAC Skills Assessment: A CAC Skills Assessment can assist you in determining your current English, Reading, and Math levels of skills and abilities, and will provide you with recommendations for an appropriate class to meet your needs. After using the Placement Tools above, take the Skills Assessment if you are still unsure of the correct classes to take. It will provide you with more detailed recommendations for correct placement. \u2022English & Reading Skills Assessment Tool \u2022Mathematics Skills Assessment Tool ? For guidance in appropriate math course placement please use the Math Placement Guide for Students and Advisors You will receive the results when you complete the tool. Bring any assessment results to your advising meeting. Option #3: Discussion with Academic Advisor A student may consult with an academic advisor before registering to ensure the best course fit. A student may also self-place using these measures. In classes such as English and Math a brief in-class assessment may be given the first day of class to confirm appropriate placement in order to best serve student educational success. Current High School Students may be placed into courses based upon a recommendation from a high school guidance counselor or other qualified high school representative Advising Locations Advising Locations Advising Signal Peak Campus (SPC) ~ 8470 N.
