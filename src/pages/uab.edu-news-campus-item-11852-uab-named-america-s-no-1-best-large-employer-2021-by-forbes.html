The University of Alabama at Birmingham has been named America\u2019s No. 1 Best Large Employer by Forbes, topping the list of more than 500 public and private corporations, hospitals, universities, Fortune 500 companies and more, across dozens of industries. Alabama\u2019s largest public employer and home of one of the region\u2019s largest academic medical centers, UAB employs more than 23,000 people across its university and hospital entities, has more than 22,000 enrolled students, and has an annual economic impact exceeding $7 billion on the state. \u201CWe often say our people are what make UAB special,\u201D said UAB President Ray L. Watts. \u201CWhat makes Forbes\u2019 recognition so meaningful is that it is based largely on whether our employees would recommend UAB to friends and family. Especially after such a challenging year, knowing that our people are proud to be part of the UAB family is eternally humbling and gratifying. \u201CAs UAB celebrates this distinction, I want to recognize everyone at UAB who works with dedication to our vital mission every day,\u201D Watts said. \u201CI also thank the University of Alabama System and our Board of Trustees, whose vision, leadership and continued support have been critical to our growth into a place special enough to be called America\u2019s No. 1 Best Large Employer by Forbes.\u201D In a year marked by uncertainty and triumphs as UAB navigated caring for hundreds of COVID-19 patients, pivoting research priorities to help advance therapeutics and treatments to fight the pandemic \u2014 all while keeping its academic entities moving forward through a fluid hybrid learning approach \u2014 employees were provided access to resources such as personal protective equipment, mental health tools and wellness days, and access to assistance resources like food supplementation and child care support, among others. The university is now vaccinating employees within Alabama Department of Public Health requirements. A full list of Forbes\u2019 America\u2019s Best Large Employers list can be found here. Methodology for creation of the 2021 list involved Statista\u2019s anonymously surveying 38,000 Americans working for businesses with at least 1,000 employees. According to Forbes, respondents were asked to rate on a scale of zero to 10 how likely they would be to recommend their employer to friends and family, and then encouraged participants to nominate other organizations they do and do not recommend. The final list ranks the 500 large and 500 midsize employers that received the most recommendations. \u201CUAB has long been known for its extraordinary teams; but to receive this honor in 2021 is even more special knowing how our employees truly came together to overcome challenges, care for our community and state, and provide lifesaving care to patients across all specialties amid the pandemic \u2014 it is remarkable,\u201D said UAB Medicine Chief Executive Officer Reid Jones. \u201CIn reflection of all we have been able to accomplish together, I am confident that this recognition is just the start of people seeing what truly makes UAB a phenomenal place to work and grow.\u201D UAB boasts many nationally ranked programs, with 16 graduate and professional programs in the schools of Health Professions, Nursing, Medicine, Engineering, Education, Business and Public Health and the College of Arts and Sciences all ranked in the 2020 U.S. News Best Graduate School Rankings.

During that time period, UAB\u2019s total NIH funding rose more than $100 million, topping the $234 million mark in 2018. Only seven other academic medical centers in the United States increased their NIH funding by more than $100 million during that same timeframe, placing UAB among an elite group of eight academic medical centers. \u201CAs UAB celebrates this distinction, I want to recognize everyone at UAB who works with dedication to our vital mission every day,\u201D said UAB President Ray L. Watts. UAB Hospital, the centerpiece of the UAB Health System, is among the 20 largest hospitals in the United States.
