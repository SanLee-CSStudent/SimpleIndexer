Applying for your degree and registering for the ceremony are separate processes. Due to guidance on indoor gatherings and social distancing, we must know you will attend well in advance of the ceremony date. Giving us your RSVP allows us to factor you into our seating plans. If you miss the deadline, it is possible that we may not be able to seat you with the other graduating students. In order to keep everyone attending safe and socially distanced, we must know if you plan on attending by the deadline. If you are not sure whether you will attend, it is best to register anyway. It is a much safer outcome for us to have too many seats than too few.
