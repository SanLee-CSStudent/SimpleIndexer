Tips for Writing an Effective Cover Letter A cover letter, explains to the employer why you are qualified for the position in which you are applying and why you should be selected for an interview. The cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your r?sum?. Its purpose is to interpret the r?sum? and add a personal touch. The letter of application is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression. That first glance at your letter of application is your one opportunity to make a good impression and make it to the next round in the search process. A well-written cover letter will address the job posting and state why you are qualified for the position. This way, the search committee can see at a glance, why and how you\u2019re qualified for the job. The cover letter responds to a known job opening and should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position. Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific job position and identify your most relevant skills or experiences. To write a custom cover letter, take the job posting and list the criteria the employer is looking for. Then list the skills and experience you have. Either address how your skills match the job in paragraph form or list the criteria and your qualifications. Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each position you seek. Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer. Although it can be time-consuming to write a custom letter of application for each job, it\u2019s important to take the time and effort to show why you are a good match. Writing a cover letter can seem like a challenging task. However, if you take it one step at a time, you\u2019ll soon be an expert at writing letters of application to send with your application packet.
