The Center was made possible through the generosity of a grant from the Student Veterans of America and Home Depot along with the support from campus leaders, Veterans, students, and Veterans Villages of America. The Center serves as a place where military students can socialize, study, and get information about available resources. The 1,634-square-foot facility has a computer area, where military students can do homework, as well as a lounge area and a break room. The Military Student Success Center serves over 700 Active Duty, Reservists, National Guard Members, Veterans, and their family members. We are here to help you with your educational journey. UA Little Rock has the honor of being a Purple Heart University. We are advocates for the military student population and are able to assist you with any concerns you may have about your student experience and facilitate a resolution.
