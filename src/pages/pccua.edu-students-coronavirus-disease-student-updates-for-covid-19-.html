I applaud your efforts, the tenacity that you possess regarding your commitment to education, and your resiliency to cope with unforeseen obstacles.

In recent weeks, the campus administration along with faculty and staff have worked diligently in planning for your return to campus. Three committees were formed to create a comprehensive COVID-19 CAMPUS REOPENING PLAN. The plan involved emergency planning, campus adaption to safeguard the health of students, faculty and staff for the academic year of 2020-2021, and community engagement. Emphasis was placed on the structure of the curriculum, the adaption to the physical environment, the operational mode of college services, and safety protocol for all campus users.
