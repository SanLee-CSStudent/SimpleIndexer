There are some areas whose responsibilities will not allow all staff to leave. Supervisors must determine and communicate what level of coverage, if any, is needed to ensure those responsibilities are met. How do I record my time in TimeClock Plus? Record your actual time worked by clocking in and out as usual. For hours missed due to early closure, perform a Timesheet Entry using the Job Code 90900-University Closed. Please read the following FAQs to determine the amount of time allowable for your situation. Instructions for performing a Timesheet Entry in TCP can be found on the Payroll website under TimeClock Plus Tutorials. How much time will I be paid for if the university closes early? You will be paid for your normally scheduled work time on that day. If you are scheduled for 7.5 hours, that will be your pay. If you are scheduled for 10 hours, that will be your pay. What if I'm working a flex schedule when the closure takes place? You will be paid for the hours you were scheduled to work on that day. However, these schedules should be adjusted in anticipation of closings if announced ahead of time. What if my regular schedule is not 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. like most of the university? If you work all of your normal schedule up until the closure time or immediately following a late opening you should receive your normal pay. If you are scheduled to work 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., you will receive 7.5 hours of pay. If you are scheduled to work 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., you will receive 10 hours of pay. If you are scheduled to work 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., you will receive 7.5 hours of pay. What if I started work earlier than normal on the day of the closing? Will I get paid more? If your normal schedule is 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but you started working at 7:30 p.m. and the university closed at 2 p.m., you will be paid for 7.5 hours since that is your regular schedule. What if I actually worked from 7:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. even though the university officially closed? If you worked the entire time, then you will be paid for all of the hours that you worked. What if I am scheduled for vacation or take a sick day on that day? An early closure simply allows those who are working on that day to depart early. It will not change the amount of leave charged to those who are absent. If the university closes at noon, can I take my lunch hour at 11 a.m. and leave an hour earlier? No. A noon closure allows plenty of time to eat after departing the university. If the university closes at 2 p.m., can I take my lunch at 1 p.m. and not come back? No. Regular lunch breaks should be taken and completed by 1 p.m. What if there is a reason I cannot leave at the time of the closing? We understand that there are areas on campus whose function is time critical and employees cannot always leave. We thank you for your dedication and service. What if I cannot leave on that day? Do I get time off another day? As stated above, this simply allows an early departure to those who are able. It does not constitute additional holiday or vacation time to be taken during normal work times. What if I am a part time employee scheduled to work that day? If you reported to work and worked up until the closure or immediately after the closure, you will be paid for the hours that you were scheduled to work on an unplanned early closure. Part time employees are not paid for scheduled holidays or scheduled closings. Management may adjust part time employee schedules to accommodate planned closings. FAQs Who is eligible to be included in the annual staff increase process? Employees actively employed with Samford University in an eligible employment classification on March 31st. Eligible employment classifications are: full time staff, executives and most coaches as well as regular part-time staff. Employees classified as temporary or occasional are not eligible for this process. Employees who received an increase greater than the maximum pool percentage allocated for the applicable year (2.5% for 2018) between April 1st and Aug. 31st of that year, are not eligible for an additional increase as part of the annual increase process. Employees who are at or above the maximum rate for their grade are considered red circled and are not eligible to receive an increase. Instead, these employees are eligible to receive a special 1% bonus. Employees who are currently below, but who would reach or exceed the maximum grade rate with this increase, may receive such an increase but will be considered red circled thereafter until or unless salary tables are adjusted. Employees who received a rating of \u20181 \u2013 Unacceptable\u2019 on their performance evaluation are not eligible for an annual increase as a part of this process. Annual staff increase amounts are based on an eligible employee\u2019s base salary as of March 31st. Annual staff increases are effective on Sept. 1st. To facilitate accurate reporting, all other staff changes should be made effective on other dates. Who must file an Alabama individual income tax return? Follow the link to the ADOR website to determine if you must file a state of Alabama income tax return. Who must file a Federal income tax return? Follow this link to the IRS web site to determine if you must file a federal income tax return. How do I increase or decrease the amount that is currently being withheld for federal and\/or state tax withholding? To change your federal withholding complete a Form W4 (Employee\u2019s Withholding Allowance Certificate) indicating filing status and the number of allowances you wish to claim. To change your state withholding, complete the Form A4 (State of Alabama Withholding Certificate). You can obtain these forms from Forms Central or the Human Resource website at forms. Submit the completed forms to the Human Resources Office in Room 301 of Samford Hall by the 15th of the month for monthly employees and by Thursday prior to payroll close date for bi-weekly employees. Can I have my net pay split between multiple bank accounts? You can have your net pay split between more than one checking or savings account. You simply complete an Authorization Agreement for Direct Deposit form and attach a voided check for each bank account. Submit the form to the Human Resources Office. You can obtain the Authorization Agreement for Direct Deposit form from Forms Central or from the Human Resources website forms page. I\u2019m leaving town before the next payday. Will I be able to get paid early? It is the university\u2019s policy not to release payroll earlier than the established pay date. Since all employees are on direct deposit, your pay will be in your designated accounts on the scheduled pay date. I have recently moved. How do I submit the change for my new address? Home and campus addresses can be updated through the Portal. Note: Be sure to update your address with your current benefit plan carriers. For example: Fidelity, TIAA, Blue Cross\/Blue Shield. Note: Changing your mailing address in Human Resources does not automatically change all addresses. If you are a Samford student or alumni, please change your address with these departments as well. I have not received my form W2 in the mail. How do I get a copy? Follow the instructions to print a copy of your W2 through the Samford portal. If you no longer have portal access, please complete a W2 request form and submit it to the Human Resources, Samford Hall, Room 301 or you can fax it to that office at (205) 726-4027. If the original W2 was returned to the university, it will be re-mailed to the address that you indicate on your signed \u201CW2 Request Form.\u201D If the original was not returned in the mail a duplicate copy will be mailed to the address indicated on your signed request form. These replacement W2s can also be faxed or picked up in the HR office according to the options selected on the request form. Please allow 10 days for processing of replacement W2s. I\u2019m a new employee, when will I receive my first paycheck? a) For bi-weekly payroll employees the pay dates are on Friday following the close of the payroll period. You can access the bi-weekly payroll schedule that reflects the pay periods and their associated pay dates via the HR website. b) For monthly payroll employees the pay dates are on the last business day of the calendar month. You can access the monthly payroll schedule that reflects the pay periods via the HR website. I have closed the bank account where my payroll direct deposit was being made. How do I ensure that I receive my next pay on time? You should notify the Human Resources office immediately by submitting a direct deposit authorization form. This form should be submitted to the HR office the Friday prior to the pay date for bi-weekly paid employees or by the 10th of the month for monthly paid employees if possible. These dates may be earlier during months with scheduled holidays. A campus wide e-mail will be sent if due dates are changed. If your request is not received by payroll services in time to process the change for the next pay date, your bank will send a notification to payroll within three to five business days if the funds submitted to the closed account have been returned to the university. Once payroll receives notification from the bank, these funds will be available to be sent to your new account. Note: It is recommended that you change your direct deposit information to reflect your new account prior to closing your old account. I've started work but I cannot access TimeClock Plus yet, what should I do? The first thing an employee should do in this situation is to check with his\/her supervisor who should confirm the Employment Form has been completed and has begun the proper approval route to the Human Resources office. We are unable to assign jobs to employees for whom we have not received an employment form. The employee should contact human resources to ensure that all required forms have been completed (i.e., direct deposit enrollment, security agreement, etc.). For employees for whom an employment form did not reach HR in time for TCP access to be granted, please track all hours worked and report so your supervisor can enter them into TCP once access has been established. If the payroll period during which these hours were worked has closed, the supervisor should email payroll@samford.edu for instructions. Why have I not gotten paid? If the employee is biweekly and has not clocked hours in TimeClock Plus, they will not be paid until his\/her time has been reported. Employees should check to be certain that all time was clocked and approved in TCP by the deadline. If the employee is a monthly employee, his\/her letter of agreement or supplemental pay request form may have either been turned in to the payroll office late or filled out incorrectly. Employees should check with their department to see if their paperwork has been turned in on time and processed correctly. Once the issue has been resolved and the paperwork received, the employee will be paid on the next payroll. My check is direct deposited into my checking account, but I\u2019m not getting an earning statement, how do I know the amount of my check? All earnings statements are sent via email to your Samford University email account. Due to the security in place it is not possible to have this sent to a different email address. These can also be accessed via the Samford Portal. Click on the Banner tab. Choose Employee, Pay Information, then Pay Stub. How does my leave accrue?
