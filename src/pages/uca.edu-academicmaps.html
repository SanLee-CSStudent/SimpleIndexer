Beginning in fall 2015, we added links to information about undergraduate minor programs, increasingly recognized as a way to enrich a major with complementary knowledge and skills. Links to each year\u2019s guide are listed by the academic year, accessed from the Academic Year tab above. Six years of plans are kept in the navigation tab. Older annual index pages are linked from the Archives tab. An Academic Map is a plan designed by academic departments to assist students in mapping a program of study to meet all degree requirements for graduation from UCA. Academic Maps include, but are not limited to, programs participating in the Eight-Semester academic map\/program completion plan initiative (see below). Academic Maps are intended to inform everyone but are, in terms of schedule, particularly applicable to first-time freshmen who begin in the fall semester of an academic year. (See the Eight-Semester Degree Completion Program, below.) Students: You should meet with an academic advisor every semester to consider available course offerings in relation to graduation requirements, to confirm academic progress toward graduation, and to update your plan of study. Remember that changes of major or minor, repeating courses, or any other disruption in your plan of study may be unavoidable but may also delay timely completion of your degree. Ask your advisor about UCA\u2019s powerful program-planning application Degree Works. The Eight-Semester Degree Completion Program UCA offers entering first-time students assistance in completing many of the university\u2019s undergraduate degrees in eight semesters, subject to the conditions of the Eight-Semester Degree Completion Agreement. Eight-semester program plans are included in the list in the Academic Year pages linked above. The following paragraphs answer two of the questions asked most frequently by students about the eight-semester agreement. How do I sign up for an eight-semester program plan? During your summer registration appointment, your advisor will ask if you want to participate in one of these plans. Your participation means that UCA will ensure class availability, as outlined in the plan, to keep you on track for graduation as long as you continue to meet the conditions for participation. What are the conditions for participation? To participate and continue in UCA\u2019s Eight-Semester Degree Completion Program, you must Enter the University of Central Arkansas as a first-year student in the fall semester and choose a major that offers an Eight-Semester degree plan. Complete the Eight-Semester Degree Completion Program Agreement with your advisor prior to the first day of class. (Use this link to view a sample of the agreement: Eight-Semester Degree Completion Agreement \u2013 Sample Form.) Follow the schedule of classes in your Eight-Semester AMAP throughout your eight semesters, deviating from it only as allowed in the Agreement. Maintain satisfactory academic progress in all courses and programs. Satisfy all prerequisites for the courses listed in your Eight-Semester AMAP prior to enrollment in courses for which they are required. (This may include prerequisites for the BA degree requirement in a foreign language.) Have your course schedule approved by your official advisor each semester and enroll during your designated registration period. Accept any available section of a required course\u2014or an alternative course sequence approved by your academic advisor\u2014that can be accommodated in your class schedule. Remain in your declared major and successfully complete all courses and other degree requirements as scheduled, including a minor if required.
