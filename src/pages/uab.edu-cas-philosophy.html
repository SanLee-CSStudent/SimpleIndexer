Does free will exist? Can computers think? Is there a God? What is the meaning of life? Is abortion morally wrong? Can anyone really know anything at all? By studying such difficult questions, students of philosophy learn to read texts carefully, analyze concepts, draw careful distinctions, recognize hidden assumptions, construct and critique arguments, and explain complex ideas. These are valuable skills for all kinds of professions. As a pre-medical student, I truly appreciate how my professors have made the information relevant and personal to my interest in both philosophy and life sciences. They are extremely supportive, kind, and have always pushed me both in my classes and in my outside philosophy endeavors. \u2013 Tanvee Sinha \u201921 Apply Now Courses Student Resources Major in Philosophy Faculty Careers NEWS Celebrate 15 books authored by CAS faculty in 2021 Employees recognized at 2021 UAB Service Awards Seven students receive 2022 Dean\u2019s Awards for Outstanding Undergraduate and Graduate Students UAB recognizes 2022 diversity champions Events View All Events on the Campus Calendar Contact Us David K.
