Careers in Geology ASBOG Scholarships Earth Sciences The Earth Sciences programs at UA Little Rock are designed to provide students with knowledge of the various Earth systems and to help them develop their scientific skills. Our students learn to conduct and interpret scientific research and to successfully communicate scientific information. The major includes a rigorous, balanced core of courses and a diverse array of elective coursework, both of which include active lab and field experiences. The Earth Sciences program prepares students for graduate or professional programs and for careers in the private sector, government service, and education. We have a growing group of alumni working in central Arkansas, and the list of employers includes Southwestern Energy, the United States Geological Survey, the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, Terracon, and the Arkansas Geological Survey. We also have alumni in geosciences graduate programs or otherwise employed throughout the United States and around the world. Independent research projects are incorporated into many of our courses. Additionally, many of our majors conduct more substantial research projects that are mentored by our own faculty or through programs at other institutions. Many of the sub-disciplines with the Earth Sciences are field based, and we incorporate field experiences in many, if not most, of our courses and into most of our research activities.
