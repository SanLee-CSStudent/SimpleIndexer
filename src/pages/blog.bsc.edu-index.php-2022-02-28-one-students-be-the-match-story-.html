But last fall, Solfronk was a match and donated her marrow, which saved the life of an anonymous recipient. \u201CMost people think that a family member would be an easy way to get a donor,\u201D she says, \u201Cbut only 25 percent of patients have a family member who is a close enough genetic match to donate.\u201D After receiving a call in June 2021 that she was a potential match, Solfronk had her bone marrow surgery in August, donating 1.2-1.5 liters of blood from the back of her pelvic bone. She decided to document her journey on her Instagram account so she could inform more people about the process. \u201CI thought that if I put out the information that I knew and my feelings in real time, I could encourage new young people to join,\u201D Solfronk says. \u201COn Instagram, I gave some background about Be The Match and then documented my doctor\u2019s appointments, flights, time touring the city, surgery date, and how I was feeling after surgery.\u201D Operated by the National Marrow Donor Program, Be The Match manages the most diverse marrow registry in the world in order to support transplants for patients with life-threatening blood diseases. The organization covered the costs of Solfronk\u2019s travel to the selected city and hospital and provided food stipends during the trip. While some donations do have a non-surgical option, her surgery was the more intensive option. Solfronk spent one night in the hospital and had soreness in her back but felt normal after a few weeks. The donation process was completely anonymous \u2013 Solfronk only knew the recipient\u2019s age, gender, and disease or health concern associated with the donation. The recipient could be anywhere from the United States. \u201CSo many people I talked to were surprised that I was willing to do this, to go through lab testing, flights and surgery all for a stranger,\u201D she says. \u201CBut being a donor has really highlighted how connected we all are with each other. The person I donated to had a disease that would kill them if they did not have a donor, but with my donation they are almost certainly cured for life.\u201D Solfronk encourages others to join the Be The Match registry, an easy process that requires basic medical information and completing a swab kit. It could be years before a registered individual is contacted about a match, but the larger the registry, the better the matches are for people in need of a donation. \u201CThere are so many disparities within the donor-recipient populations,\u201D Solfronk says. \u201CYou have to have certain matching genetic markers, and sometimes minority recipients have to wait for longer periods of time to get a donor because there are not as many donors of color within the system.\u201D She admits the process can seem scary, but Solfronk says donating is one of the most rewarding things she has done and will ever do. \u201CBeing a part of a group of people who decided to put themselves out there to help others that they do not know has been so rewarding,\u201D she says. \u201CDuring COVID, it sometimes feels like we are all trying to protect ourselves and our families, but the people at Be The Match and the donors all work to protect others around them.\u201D Categories \u2019Southern Admission Alumni Engagement Athletics Business and Economics Campus Culture Class Notes Education Event Spotlight Faculty Excellence Fine and Performing Arts Giving to BSC Health Professions Humanities Law Math and Applied Computer Science Modern Foreign Languages Natural Sciences Notes From Munger Religious Studies and Ministry Service Learning Social Sciences Student Life Study Abroad Welcome Blog Meta Log in Entries feed Comments feed WordPress.org ? 2022 THE BSC BLOG.
