The Best Hospitals specialty rankings assess hospital performance in 15 specialties or specialty areas. In 12 of these, rankings are determined by an extensive data-driven analysis combining performance measures in three primary dimensions of health care: structure, process\/expert opinion, and outcomes. In the three other specialties, ranking relies solely on expert opinion. The structural measures include hospital volume, nurse staffing and other resources that define the hospital environment. The data source for most structural measures is the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Additional resources include the National Cancer Institute\u2019s list of NIH-designated cancer centers and the American Nurses Credentialing Center\u2019s roster of Nurse Magnet hospitals. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
