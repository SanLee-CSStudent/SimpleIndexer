As an academic health system, USA Health provides advanced and innovative patient care through its University hospitals and clinics, as well as first-class training experiences for the next generation of healthcare providers and scientists. In doing so, USA Health has a significant positive impact on the quality of life for all residents across the Gulf Coast. Care and Treatment USA Health University Hospital is on the front line in delivering nationally recognized quality care to the area\u2019s most critically ill patients, with the region\u2019s only Level I trauma center and a burn center that provides care from injury to recovery. The life-saving care that stroke and heart patients receive has been recognized year after year by the American Heart Association. University Hospital also plays a key role in the education of tomorrow\u2019s healthcare professionals, each year training hundreds of future professionals from the colleges of Medicine, Nursing and Allied Health Professions. USA Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Hospital, among a handful of freestanding hospitals in the United States devoted exclusively to the care of children and women, offers the region\u2019s most advanced neonatal intensive care and pediatric intensive care units. Providers at Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Hospital deliver nearly 3,000 babies each year and specialize in high-risk OB\/GYN patients. Hospital staff offer a variety of innovative programs for hospitalized children, teens and their families to meet their developmental, educational, social and emotional needs. Combining cutting-edge research with advanced care, the USA Mitchell Cancer Institute fights cancer from the laboratory bench to the patient\u2019s bedside. With more than 40 clinical trials and 50,000 annual patient visits, MCI is the only academic-based cancer research and treatment facility on the Gulf Coast. In July 2017, MCI opened a new clinic in nearby Fairhope, an 11,000-square-foot space that includes exam rooms, cancer treatment areas and physicians\u2019 offices. USA Health Physicians Group is composed of nearly 250 physicians and 80 advanced practice providers who conduct more than 190,000 patient visits each year. The physicians group is the region\u2019s largest multispecialty practice and the only academic physicians group on the Gulf Coast. Physicians are on faculty at the USA College of Medicine, and the majority of USA Health clinics are located in midtown Mobile at the Strada Patient Care Center, which houses clinics for pediatrics, neurosciences, surgical specialties, obstetrics & gynecology, orthopaedics and therapy services, as well as a breast and mammography center. In recent years, USA Health has extended its availability to people in the Gulf Coast region through collaborations with local community physicians. This growing effort enables more people to benefit from the region\u2019s only academic medical center. The on-campus Student Health Center is staffed by physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and licensed practical nurses dedicated to providing quality medical and educational services to the entire student body. Education Residents of the Gulf Coast are healthier thanks to the USA College of Medicine. During its history, the college has supplied one-third of the physicians in the Mobile area. The only academic health center along the Gulf Coast, the college enrolls 74 medical students each year, selected from more than 1,100 applicants, and provides graduate medical education training to more than 240 residents and fellows. A doctoral program in basic medical sciences can open doors to academic careers in universities or medical institutions, or to research or administrative positions in government, non-profit or industry settings.
