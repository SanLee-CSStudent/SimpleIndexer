Stars and Stripes Scholarship Facts and Questions When will I receive the MHA and book stipend for Chapter 33 Post\/911? The Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) for POST\/911 is typically paid at the end of the month if the student submitted all necessary documents before the beginning of the school term. Students will typically see the MHA come into their accounts by the first weekend of the next month; however, the MHA is paid out by the VA. Students are encouraged to contact the VA first about missing MHA payments before contacting the School Certifying Official (SCO). Please be advise, all students using Chapter 33 POST\/911 need to setup an account with the VA to verify monthly enrollment, or students will not receive their MHA. Call the number below, select \u201C0\u201D and speak with a representative to have the account setup. The book stipend can vary depending on when the certification was submitted, but it is generally the first weekend of the next month. National Education Call Center: 888-442-4551 How long does it take to receive the monthly income for Chapter 30 & 35 Chapter 30 Montgomery and Chapter 35 DEA are paid out at the end of the month. Students will typically see the monthly income check the first weekend of the next month. Students are encouraged to contact the VA first about missing monthly income checks before contacting the School Certifying Official (SCO). National Education Call Center: 888-442-4551 What documents are needed to be certified each term for VA Education Benefits? In order for the School Certifying Official (SCO) to submit a certification, students will need to submit the VA Certification Request Form, a signed Master Academic Plan (MAP) and student schedule to the SCO. More documentation could be required depending on each students situation. For new students, please see NEW STUDENT tab on the school\u2019s VA Educational Benefits Website or if you are a current\/re-entry student please see CURRENT STUDENT to see if other documents are needed for a submission. Please note that the VA Certification Request Form and MAP will be required for EACH semester that the student would like to use their VA Benefits to pay for school. What is the purpose of the VA HOLD and how long will it be on my account? The VA hold prevents all students using VA Education Benefits from registering courses, adding courses, or changing courses without seeing an Academic Advisor first. The hold does not affect finances from seeing class schedules. It only prevents registration and will remain on the student\u2019s account until the student is no longer using VA benefits or has exhausted them. If a student chooses to no longer use the VA benefits, then the student must submit an email to the School Certifying Official (SCO) to have the Hold removed. What is a \"MAP\" and why is it needed for certification? For every semester a student is using VA benefits to pay for school, the student needs to have a MAP (Master Academic Plan) which is a requirement for VA Compliance. The MAP will be filled out by the academic advisor, as well as signed to prove that all courses being taken are applicable to the degree. The MAP will need to be updated each semester by the advisor. The VA will not cover courses that are not applicable to programs. Do Veterans need to obtain their Military Joint Service Transcripts? Is so, how? Students are required to have all official transcripts on file with Central Arizona College by the second term for any colleges\/military the student has notated on their application with CAC. Veteran students may obtain a copy of their military transcripts through the DoD. If a student does not wish to obtain the Joint Service Transcript, they will need to notify the School Certifying Official to notate it in the file. Central Arizona College only accepts one credit for physical education. Will I receive a the MHA if my courses are Online? Yes, if the student is full time (12 credits or higher for Spring and Fall, 6 credits for summer) and is at 100% eligibility for the POST\/911, the student will receive the Online MHA as oppose to the MHA. Please see the comparison tool on the VA website to calculate the MHA for online only courses. When will tuition and fees be paid for Chapter 33 POST\/911? Tuition and Fees for the POST\/911 Chapter can take 2-16 weeks to get to a school from the VA. Students using this chapter will not have to worry about having that amount paid off before registering for the next term. **Please note that if the student has any other fees on file, such as a book charge fee, then the school can prevent them from being registered until those fees are paid.** Do Chapter 35 DEA students have to report attendance to the VA? No, Chapter 35 DEA students do not have to report attendance to the VA. How to Chapter 30 & Chapter 33 verify their monthly enrollment? Chapter 33 POST\/911 will need call the National Education Center at 1-888-442-4551 and setup an account with the VA by pressing \u201C0\u201D and speaking with a representative. Once the account is setup, they can either call at the end of each month, or opt to be texted by the VA. Until a student verifies, they will not receive their MHA. Chapter 30 Montgomery students must report their monthly attendance through WAVES found on the eBenefits website. Do I have to turn in paperwork to the School Certifying Official (SCO) every semester? Yes, the School Certifying Official (SCO) will need the VA Certification Request Form and MAP for EACH semester the student would like to use their VA Benefits to pay for school. Without the VA Certification Request form, the SCO does not have authorization from the student to submit to the VA. Will the VA pay for remedial courses? The VA will pay for remedial courses (courses below 100 level), if the course is completely on ground, not online or hybrid, and if the academic advisor has approved the student to take the course and placed it on the MAP. Why does the book stipend for Chapter 33 Post\/911 come so late, and what is the Promissory Note? Certifications for enrollment for Chapter 33 are not submitted until a week before school starts due to CAC purge dates. This prevents the book stipend from being sent early enough for students to get books, so CAC has set up a Promissory Note for Veterans and Dependents to charge up to $500 at the CAC bookstore. A student may only charge on designated dates set up by the bookstore. The promissory is NOT free money. Students, not the VA, will have to pay back the bookstore if they choose to use the Promissory Note. Please see the home page for Bookstore Charge Dates. Is there a deadline to submit paperwork to the SCO for certification? For Chapter 33 POST\/911, the certification process will be done in two parts: The first submission will be a week before the term begins. Once the Add\/Drop period is completed, and there are no changes to the schedule, a second submission will be placed for tuition and fees. Emails will be sent out from the VA for each transaction. There is no need to contact the School Certifying Official (SCO) that the emails were received. CHAPTER 33 POST\/911 DEADLINE: Within 30 days of the first day of the Term. If paperwork is received after, per VA policy the certification cannot be submitted. Please keep in mind that it is 30 days from the first day of the term, not when the course starts. For all other chapters, certifications will be submitted at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the term date, if the submission paperwork was received prior to that start of the term. Any and all changes made to a student\u2019s schedule will need to be notified to the SCO by the student on the day the change occurred to prevent debt and error with the VA. This includes being dropped from classes in error, choosing to be dropped from class, instructors dropping the class, or start dates changing. Does Central Arizona College accept Tuition Assistant (TA) from the DoD? Yes, Central Arizona College has an active MOU with the DoD for all branches of service.
