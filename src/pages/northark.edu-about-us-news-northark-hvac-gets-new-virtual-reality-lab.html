Carlos Escobar is on his knees on a 90-degree June day trying to fix a heating and cooling system that is not working, but he isn\u2019t even breaking a sweat. The Northark Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) student is in the comfort and safety of the College\u2019s newest high-tech training tool \u2013 a virtual reality (VR) lab. VR is often associated with gaming, but it is not just for entertainment. The technology is vastly improving training for skilled trades. Northark HVAC instructor Jeff Smith said VR for HVAC systems was developed a few years ago to help contractors maintain and improve their skills, but now the systems have been adapted for educational purposes and training. The VR systems utilize scenes and scripts that walk students through different scenarios so they can identify problems. The HVAC components and tools look real and the systems even allow students to work in life-like home or outdoor environments. \u201CThe students love it,\u201D Smith said. \u201CVR is a great addition to the program, and I can\u2019t say enough good things about it.\u201D Smith said students start out the three-semester HVAC technical certificate program or the one-semester certificate of proficiency program with hands-on labs and lectures before using the VR system, which is tied to the curriculum. In addition to classroom and field work, students have VR assignments that they must complete. \u201CThe VR gives students an additional means of training and support to build upon what they have already learned in lecture and lab,\u201D he said. Northark\u2019s program has three VR systems and is hoping to acquire three more in the coming months. Escobar said at first it was a little difficult to use VR but with some practice, he was able get the hang of it. \u201CIt\u2019s interesting because you can safely get to know about HVAC,\u201D he said. \u201CWe can practice with the VR.\u201D Fellow student Jay Lamb agrees and said VR is a great tool for learning new skills. \u201CYou are getting to do something hands on but not actually at a job site,\u201D he said. Smith said students should have no problem finding jobs with the skills they learn in Northark\u2019s HVAC program. He said there is always a demand for HVAC technicians in any area of the country, and HVAC technicians in the Harrison area can earn on average $30,000 to $40,000 per year. Escobar said the need for technicians is what drew him to the HVAC field. \u201CThere is a lot of opportunity,\u201D he said. \u201CYou can find a job like this anywhere. It might be hot sometimes, but it\u2019s a good job.\u201D Enrollment is currently open for the fall semester. Classes begin Aug. 16. Call 870-391-3505 for more information.
