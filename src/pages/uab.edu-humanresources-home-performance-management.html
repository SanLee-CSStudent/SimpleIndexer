FAQs: Completing an Evaluation in the Online App Q: What is the difference between \"Save,\" \"Submit,\" and \"Sign\" on the evaluation app? Pressing the \u201CSave\u201D button allows you to return to the evaluation and continue working on it later. You should save your work frequently to ensure it\u2019s stored in the app. Pressing \u201CSubmit\u201D locks your evaluation to changes and sends it to another person for review. Submitting your self-evaluation allows your manager to view your ratings and comments; if you\u2019re a manager, submitting an evaluation of an employee allows the employee to view your comments and ratings. There is a new tool in the app that allows you to monitor your progress. Q: Can I make changes to my evaluation after I submit it? Once a self-evaluation is submitted, an employee can no longer make edits to the self-evaluation. Once a manager's evaluation is submitted, the manager can no longer make edits to the evaluation. Q: I'm a manager. Why can't I submit my evaluation of one of my employees? The manager's evaluation can only be submitted after an employee submits their self-evaluation. On the Manager Dashboard, the \"Employee Submitted?\" column indicates if an employee has submitted their self-evaluation. Q: I'm a manager. How do I reassign one of my employees to another supervisor? The first method is to reassign the supervisor in Oracle. This is the preferred option, as it ensures continuity across systems. After the data change ACT document is completed, allow 24 hours for the change to be reflected in the electronic evaluation app. The second option is to use the \"Assign Supervisor\" function in the electronic form. The manager must be assigned as the Oracle supervisor for both the new supervisor and the employee to be reassigned under the new supervisor. This change only affects the electronic evaluation and does not impact other systems. When reassigning a supervisor, the new supervisor is entirely responsible for the evaluation. Q: How do I add goals to my evaluation? To add goals, open the \"My Goals\" tab in the app. Any goals entered will be automatically populated on your self-evaluation. After submitting your self-evaluation, goals become locked for edits. Goals are optional for Individual Contributors and Emerging Leaders, and required for Functional Managers, Functional Directors, and Organizational Leaders. Q: What do the fields \"Goal,\" \"Goal Description\" and \"Goal Type\" mean? Use the \"Goal\" field to enter your goal. \"Goal Description\" is an optional field to add additional information you may wish to capture about that goal, such as steps to achieve, assistance or resources that may be needed, or any general comments. There are two goal types as a part of UAB's performance management process: development goals and performance goals. Development goals are activities that will add to the employee\u2019s ability to perform their job more effectively and\/or prepare them for additional responsibilities. Development goals relate to training, learning, skill building, or other aspects of professional or career development. Performance goals relate to productivity, accountability, assignments, or other aspects of work performance. Q: Are goals evaluated? Goals are evaluated as part of the past year's performance. Use the fields under \"achieving results\" and \"building relationships\" to discuss progress against goals. Q: What is the FY2021 Formal Evaluation Period? The Formal Evaluation Period is July 1-September 30. Q: What are the deadlines for completing a self-evaluation or manager evaluation? The electronic evaluation must be fully completed and signed by the manager and employee by September 30. Some departments may set internal timelines for completing these steps; however, there is no university-wide requirement for individual actions such as completing the self-evaluation, completing the manager evaluation, or having the performance conversation.
