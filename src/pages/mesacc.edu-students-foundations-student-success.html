The Title III grant is part of the Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP). The formal grant term was from 2011 to 2016. Mesa Community College has institutionalized many features of the grant including the Director of Developmental Education to help coordinate the developmental education program at the college and Foundations Advising to ensure proactive advisement exists for students who place into preparatory coursework. What's Our Focus? The FSS grant objectives focused on improving the quality of developmental education programs starting with the developmental math program and moving into developmental reading and developmental English. The focus on developmental education at MCC is one of the strategies for increasing completion rates overall. Specifically, program priorities are related to the improvement of course completion rates and improvement of persistence and graduation rates at the college. How Do We Do This? Grant activities centered on intensive, continual professional development for faculty who teach developmental education courses, the redesign of developmental courses, and the redesign of academic learning environments. Each of the core disciplines (math, reading, and English) had a 2-year implementation life cycle to incorporate faculty training and curriculum changes. A portion of grant funds are being utilized to purchase new technology\/equipment for classroom and laboratory use for each core discipline. The Foundations for Student Success is a Strengthening Institutions Program, Title III, Part A grant funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The $2,000,000 federal grant allocated $400,000 per year over a 5-year period from October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2016.
