The IEP provides instruction to International undergraduate or graduate students applying for admission to a US college or university who must first improve their language skills International undergraduate or graduate students who have been admitted to UCA but require or desire further language preparation International students and community residents who wish to improve their language skills for personal or professional purposes International groups that require specialized language and cultural courses and activities. OUR PROGRAM The IEP began in 1992 and is dedicated to giving students the best instruction possible with its highly trained, dedicated faculty using the most up-to-date instructional techniques in the field of second language learning. After completing the program, most students begin their academic studies at UCA or other universities and colleges in the United States. The IEP has six levels of study from beginner to advanced. Each level is 8 weeks in length and classes meet 22 hours per week. Because our terms are 8 weeks long, mid-semester entry is possible. Students take a test and are placed in the appropriate level during orientation. Students study Grammar, Writing, Reading and Vocabulary. No TOEFL score is required to exit the IEP for undergraduate students. All teachers in the IEP have advanced degrees in areas related to teaching English to international students. Students regularly engage with international and American students on campus through classroom activities with international classmates, conversation partners and on-and off-campus events.
