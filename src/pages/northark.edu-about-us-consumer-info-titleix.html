It creates a hostile environment that has no place on our campus. It's something we take very seriously as we work to keep you safe and to respond effectively and immediately when you're in trouble. Notice of Non-Discrimination We don't tolerate discrimination of any kind at Northark. Here's what it means regarding Title IX: Our institution does not discriminate on the basis of sex within educational programs and activities in accordance with Title IX requirements. Inquiries about the application of Title IX may be referred to our Title IX Coordinator or to the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights at ocr@ed.gov. Prohibited sex discrimination covers sexual harassment, including sexual violence Title IX Complaints and Investigations We'll investigate Title IX complaints in a prompt, fair and impartial manner. We'll take steps to prevent the recurrence of any harassment and to correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, if appropriate. Protective interim steps may be taken to protect the complainant before the final outcome of the investigation is reached. You have the option to avoid contact with the alleged perpetrator. We'll talk to you about this right away. Both parties can present witnesses or other evidence, and both will be notified of the outcome. The time frame for a grievance investigation will typically take up to 60 days. You have the right to file a Title IX sex discrimination complaint with our institution in additional to filing a criminal complaint. Confidentiality Concerns We will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond in a manner consistent with a student's confidentiality request. And we'll let you know when we can't ensure confidentiality. If the safety of others in the community could be at risk, the good of the whole may need to outweigh one student's confidentiality request. If a student requests confidentiality and decides not to press charges in a sexual violence case, an anonymous report of the incident must still be made in order to comply with the Clery Act. On-campus advocates, victim advocacy offices, women's and health centers, as well as licensed counselors can talk with a survivor in confidence. Responding to Retaliation Title IX protects all college students from retaliation if they report sexual harassment or violence. If the alleged perpetrator or his\/her friends taunt you, call you names or harass you in any way, report this immediately. Our Title IX Coordinator and others are there as resources to take strong, responsive action if any retaliation or new incidents of harassment occur. Helping A Friend Do you have a friend who has experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence? In order to help him\/her in the best possible ways, you can: Listen Direct him\/her to available resources Not take everything on your shoulders Getting the appropriate, trained professionals involved is the best thing you can do to help a friend get the real help he or she may need. How to File A Title IX Complaint Sexual harassment and violence is serious, and it is important that you talk with someone about it. Gender discrimination and\/or sexual harassment or misconduct should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinators.
