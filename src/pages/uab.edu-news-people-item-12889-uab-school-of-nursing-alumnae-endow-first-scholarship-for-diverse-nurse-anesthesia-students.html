Thurston, DNP, and LaDana Williams-Davis, DNP, are alumnae of the UAB School of Nursing and have worked in the UAB Health System as CRNAs for more than 10 years. Their new scholarship will support students underrepresented in the nurse anesthesia field. University of Alabama at BirminghamKesha L. Thurston and LaDana Williams-Davis Photography: Frank Couch alumnae Kesha L. Thurston, DNP, and LaDana Williams-Davis, DNP, have endowed a scholarship to the UAB School of Nursing. The scholarship will be open to students who are in good academic standing and are currently enrolled in or admitted to the Nurse Anesthesia program. Thurston and Williams-Davis have served as certified registered nurse anesthetists at UAB Hospital-Highlands and UAB Hospital, respectively, for more than 10 years. They hope their scholarship will increase diversity within the nurse anesthesia profession by motivating and supporting students who are underrepresented in the field. \u201CLaDana and I have worked in many hospitals together over the years, and we still hear from patients that we are the only Black CRNAs they\u2019ve ever seen and how great it is that they can relate to someone of the same culture and demographic,\u201D Thurston said. \u201CDepending on the literature you read, the percentage of Black CRNAs in the nation is 3 percent, and so anything we can do to help facilitate the matriculation into the program, we will do.\u201D \u201CIt always puts a patient at ease to see people who look like them and identify with them in a hospital because they know that they can relate to them in certain ways that they wouldn\u2019t be able to in other situations,\u201D Williams-Davis said. \u201CCertain demographics use different terminologies, so having that diversity among the nurses and nurse anesthetists is important to ensure we are caring for the patient to the best of our abilities.\u201D Reflecting on her own student experience, Thurston credits her mentors and faculty from the UAB School of Nursing for keeping her motivated and helping her to be a successful CRNA. Click here to apply to UAB and start your path to becoming a CRNA. \u201CI remember having a professor named Dr. Charlie Dickson and wanting to be just like her when I graduated,\u201D Thurston said. \u201CHaving those role models that not only inspire you but also look like you is impactful when you never had nursing role models up to that point.\u201D Williams-Davis had a path different from Thurston\u2019s and started her academic career later in life. She recognizes the positive impact financial help and scholarships can have on one\u2019s career. \u201CI was a late bloomer to UAB. I came from a family that believed in going to work straight out of high school, and that just wasn\u2019t the route I wanted to take,\u201D Williams-Davis said. \u201CI luckily met Charlie Cook and her husband, Judge Ralph Cook, and they said that if I maintained a 3.0 GPA they would financially support me through nursing school, and that was the start of my career as a nurse and later a nurse anesthetist.\u201D Those who wish to donate to the endowment can visit the UAB School of Nursing website. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
