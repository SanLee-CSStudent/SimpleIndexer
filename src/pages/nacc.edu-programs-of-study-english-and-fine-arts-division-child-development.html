The need for childcare is ever increasing and qualified personnel are needed to fill the many positions available. Northeast is authorized to offer both a short-term certificate and the Associate in Applied Science degree in Child Development, which helps graduates meet credentialing requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. Additionally, parts of the curriculum may apply toward the BS degree in Early Childhood Education at 4-year colleges. Instructors are highly qualified in their field and enthusiastically assist their students in becoming successful. In addition to traditional classroom studies, students are exposed to real-life teaching situations through a required preceptorship. This program is part of the English and Fine Arts Division.
