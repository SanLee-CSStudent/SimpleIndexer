The word \u201Cauthenticity\u201D is a workhorse of a term nowadays. From psychology to music, mindfulness to movies, and academic scholarship to internet chatter \u2014 the use of the word is a defining feature of intellectual culture. The 2022 University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s annual Jemison Lecture will dive into the history of this commonly used word. Join Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen, Ph.D., Jemison Visiting Professor in the UAB College of Arts and Sciences and explore how 20th century scholars repurposed the concept of authenticity and how that still has implications today. The lecture, hosted by the UAB Department of History, will be at the UAB National Alumni Society House at 5 p.m. Wednesday, April 6, with an opening reception starting at 4 p.m. Click here for more information. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
