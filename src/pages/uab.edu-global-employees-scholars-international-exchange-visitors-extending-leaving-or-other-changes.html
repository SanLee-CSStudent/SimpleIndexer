Transferring labs at UAB You have been invited to UAB by a specific PI to research a specific project in a specific lab in a specific department, and that is what we represent to the US Department of State, which allows you to remain in the US. Transfers to other research opportunities in other labs or departments at UAB are rare and will be decided on a case-by-case basis based on factors such as how similar the proposed new research will be and possible detriment to ongoing work in your current lab\/department if you leave. If you are experiencing an unpleasant or unfair work environment, please contact UAB Employee Relations at UAB Employee Relations or UAB Employee Assistance and Counseling. Conversations will be kept as confidential as possible. We care about your safety and comfort while at UAB.

Prior participation in a J-1 program may subject you to a 12-month or 24-month bar and prevent you from coming to UAB in the Research Scholar or Professor category. No waivers are available for these bars. The bars also apply to J-1 and J-2 dependents. 12-month bar \u2013 22 CFR 62.20(d)(2) If you previously participated in a J-1 program in ANY category other than Research Scholar during the 12 months preceding the prospective start date at UAB, you will NOT be able to come to UAB as a Research Scholar or Professor. The bar does not apply in 3 cases: The Exchange Visitor is transferring from another institution; The Exchange Visitor spent less than 6 months in the US; The Exchange Visitor was in the Short-Term Scholar category. Examples: A J-1 Student Non-Degree who is in US for more than 6 months will need to wait 12 months after the program end date before he\/she is eligible to return as a J-1 Research Scholar or Professor. A J-1 Student Intern who is in US for only 3 months is eligible to return as a J-1 Research Scholar or Professor immediately following the internship program. 24-month bar \u2013 22 CFR 62.20(i)(2) If the prospective Exchange Visitor previously participated in a J-1 program as a Research Scholar or Professor and completed his\/her program, he\/she will NOT be able to come to UAB as a Research Scholar or Professor for 24 months. Examples: A J-1 Research Scholar held a postdoc position in Georgia from May 1, 2018 \u2013 May 1, 2019 and returned home after completing the program. This scholar would not be eligible to return as a J-1 Research Scholar or Professor for 24 months. The same J-1 Research Scholar in Georgia has been offered a postdoc position at UAB effective April 15, 2019. As long as the scholar remains active in the current program until April 15, he\/she is eligible to transfer to UAB as a J-1 Research Scholar or Professor immediately. After the program at UAB is complete and the scholar returns home, he\/she will be again subject to the 24 months repeat participation bar. IMPORTANT NOTE \u2013 these bars will also apply to the Exchange Visitor at the end of the UAB program. Two-years home residency rule (section 212(e) rule) The Department of State\u2019s J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is designed for international scholars to come to the US for a temporary period and then return to their home country to share their new knowledge. Based on 3 criteria, some J-1 visa holders are required to remain in their home country for two years following participation in a J-1 research opportunity. Being subject to this rule will affect your ability to change immigration status to H, L, K or Green Card status. The 3 criteria for being subject to the two-year home residence requirement are: You received financial support from the US or foreign government agency, such as CIEE, USAID, Fulbright, SACM, the China Scholarship Council, etc. Your skill has been listed by their country of nationality or last permanent residence as one in short supply there You are an international medical graduate who came to the US for a residency or fellowship sponsored by ECFMG If you are subject to 212(e), you must return to your home country and remain there for two years before you can return to the US on either an H-1B employment visa or as a permanent resident. There are a very few ways to avoid or \u201Cwaive\u201D the 212(e) two-year home residency requirement, such as obtaining a no-objection letter from your home government, obtaining a national interest waiver, or participating in a specific program to address physician shortages in the US, such as the Conrad 30 or Delta Doctors program. The UAB ISSS office does not assist with the waiver process and suggests that you retain qualified legal counsel.
