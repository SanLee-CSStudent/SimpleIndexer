She is a Biology, Biomedical Sciences major who expects to graduate in December. Emma was an ambassador for our UAFS Day of Giving 2022, and she signed up for the job for a simple reason. \u201CI had a voice for our club,\u201D she said. \u201CI know a lot of people who are invested in seeing me and this group of students succeed and live out our dreams of going to medical school,\u201D she said. Emma was an ambassador for the MAPS (Minority Association of Pre-Medical Students) who raised funds to send members to the Student National Medical Association\u2019s regional and national conferences. As the ambassador with the most donors, Emma was able to direct an additional $500 award to MAPS. Thanks to the hard work by Emma, other ambassadors, and so many of you, the UAFS Day of Giving raised $46,596 for a variety of student initiatives. But there is so much more to consider than just the dollar amount. In 2022, we had more ambassadors; more givers, many of them first-time givers; and more crowd-funded gifts than last year. These numbers tell us that many of our supporters are comfortable giving from their mobile devices and believe in the good work that UAFS does. We are proud we had 134 active Day of Giving ambassadors. That means that 134 people \u2013 not only students, faculty, and staff, but community supporters \u2013 volunteered their time and voice to help us fund our initiatives. Thanks to their efforts, we had gifts from 469 friends of the university who are not alumni or current students, faculty, or staff. On campus, our faculty and staff did not just volunteer their time. At least 86 members of our campus family believe in our mission enough to support it financially. This number speaks loudly to organizations and individuals considering investing in our students. The number should likewise speak loudly to our students, reminding them that for their faculty and staff, UAFS is not just a paycheck but a mission. No matter what role you play on our campus, from students to staff, friends to family, thank you so much for everything you do, and all the things that might go unnoticed. Whether you were an ambassador or donor for our 2022 Day of Giving, thank you for helping us share what makes UAFS so special to our supporters near and far.
