CAC Guided Pathways framework will promote student success in meeting their educational goals, whether they transfer to a four-year institution or enter the workforce. Title V DHSI grant has five objectives which align with CAC\u2019s Strategic Plan: Increase credentials awarded Increase fall-to-fall retention Decrease the number of undeclared students Decrease the percentage of part-time students Increase the transfer rate of Hispanic students. Grant Components\/Key Strategies: Component 1: Implementation of Guided Pathways Component 2: Redesigning Student Advising (Transfer Center and Academic Success Coaches) Component 3: Reforming the Math Curriculum and its requirements Component 4: Continual Math Boot Camp Component 5: Fiscal Stability ***The U.S. Department of Education awarded Central Arizona College a five-year Title V Developing Hispanic Serving Institutions grant of $2,413,122 in September 2018.

Guided Pathways is a national movement redesigning the way community colleges provide educational opportunities to their students. The Pathways model is an integrated, college-wide effort based on research that shows students are more likely to complete a degree closer to a two-year timeframe if they choose a program and develop an academic plan early on and have intentional structured support throughout their educational journey. This should have been the case all along, but we know that sometimes our well-intentioned processes, systems, traditions, and habits interfere with our goals. CAC staff, faculty, and even students have been strategically examining, redesigning, and transforming the college\u2019s programs and services to remove barriers and help students identify and reach their goals.
