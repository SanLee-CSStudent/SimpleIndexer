We're not the only ones who think that. Southern Living recognizes Auburn as one of the South's Best College Towns. Livability states that Auburn is one of the Top 100 Places to Live in America. USA Today, Money magazine and Forbes are among the other national publications that have recognized Auburn and neighboring Opelika. It's easy to understand why Auburn (population, 66,000) and Opelika (population, 31,000) are such great places to live. Centrally located in the Southeast, both cities are less than two hours from Atlanta and Birmingham, and only a few hours from the Gulf of Mexico beaches and the Great Smoky Mountains. (In fact, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is less than 90 minutes away!) Auburn and Opelika are both small cities that offer big opportunities. Both cities offer unique downtowns with fine dining and shopping, along with excellent schools and parks, championship golf and cultural opportunities that would rival many much larger cities. (We even have a 12-court pickleball facility that is among the best in the Southeast!) \"Here, you'll find a boutique town that's budget-friendly, a backyard full of Alabama pines, trails, and waterways to explore, year-round gentle seasons, legendary restaurants, a hub for engineering, a vibrant and youthful community, and venues that are extensions of our forward-thinking mentality and rooted traditions.\" the Auburn and Opelika Tourism Bureau states.

At the heart of the Auburn Family is the Auburn Creed. George Petrie wrote what he felt all Auburn students, faculty, and staff stood for. Today, the Auburn Creed is the beloved Auburn doctrine: I believe that this is a practical world and that I can count only on what I earn. Therefore, I believe in work, hard work. I believe in education, which gives me the knowledge to work wisely and trains my mind and my hands to work skillfully. I believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot win the respect and confidence of my fellow men. I believe in a sound mind, in a sound body and a spirit that is not afraid, and in clean sports that develop these qualities. I believe in obedience to law because it protects the rights of all. I believe in the human touch, which cultivates sympathy with my fellow men and mutual helpfulness and brings happiness for all. I believe in my Country, because it is a land of freedom and because it is my own home, and that I can best serve that country by \"doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with my God.\" And because Auburn men and women believe in these things, I believe in Auburn and love it.
