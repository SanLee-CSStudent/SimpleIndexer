NROTC Naval ROTC at Tuskegee University The NROTC program was established to educate and train qualified young men and women for service as commissioned officers in the Navy and Marine Corps. The NROTC scholarship program fills a vital need in preparing future officers for leadership and management positions in an increasingly technical Navy and Marine Corps. A four-year NROTC scholarship features full tuition at a select college or university, all college or university educational fees, a stipend for textbooks, all uniforms, three summer training events and a subsistence allowance for each academic month. Tuskegee and Auburn University NROTCs are located within 20 miles of one another and share the same Commanding Officer and active duty staff. This arrangement is known as a \"consortium.\" While specific scholarship criteria, availability and execution vary, Naval Staff contact information for either school may be used interchangeably. For more information regarding NROTC in general, please view the command brief or visit the Auburn NROTC website. Department of Naval Science MATTHEW P. ROBERTS Commanding Officer and Professor of Naval Science (PNS) The mission of the Naval ROTC is to develop NROTC students mentally, morally, and physically and to imbue them with the highest ideals of duty, honor, and loyalty; to commission college graduates as naval officers who possess a basic professional background, are motivated toward careers in the naval service, and have a potential for future development in mind and character so as to assume the highest responsibilities of command, citizenship, and government. All qualified men and women are eligible for the NROTC Program after submitting an application and being accepted as a scholarship or non-scholarship midshipman. All Naval Science courses, basic and advanced, are open to all Tuskegee students regardless of affiliation with the NROTC Program. To be eligible for enrollment as a Midshipman, an applicant must be a United States citizen; have no moral obligations or personal convictions that will prevent bearing of arms, and supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; meet age requirements of at least 17 years on or before 1 September of the year of enrollment and less than 27 years on 30 June of the year an applicant expects to graduate, complete all NROTC training requirements, and be commissioned; meet physical requirements for the NROTC Program; and be accepted for admission as a full-time student at Tuskegee University. (Applicants with prior or current active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces may be granted age waivers equal to the number of months served, not to exceed 36 months. Those granted the maximum age waiver must be less than 30 years of age on 30 June of the year they expect to graduate, complete all NROTC training requirements, and be commissioned.) Meet the Tuskegee Naval ROTC Staff: www.tuskegee.edu\/nrotcstaff CURRICULUM The Naval Science curriculum varies by program (Navy and Marine) with all Midshipmen attending two Naval Science laboratory periods for one hour each per week in addition to physical training at least twice per week. The number of Naval Science credits that may be applied toward your degree vary from two to 12, depending on your major.

Note that some warfare communities have additional requirements: Surface Warfare (ships) \u2013 8 years total, at least 5 on active duty Submarine Warfare \u2013 8 years total, at least 5 on active duty Naval Aviator (pilot, Navy or Marine) \u2013 8 years active duty after qualification as a Naval Aviator Naval Flight Officer (backseat, Navy or Marine) \u2013 8 years total, 6 years active duty after qualifying Special Warfare (SEAL) \u2013 8 years total, at least 4 years on active duty USMC Officer \u2013 8 years total, at least 4 years on active duty Naval ROTC Programs Navy-Marine Corps Scholarships The Department of the Navy pays tuition, fees, $375 per semester for textbooks, and provides a monthly stipend. Freshmen on scholarship receive $250, sophomores $300, juniors $350, and seniors $400 per month. Active duty pay for summer training is approximately $560 per month with living quarters and meals provided. Tuskegee University currently pays full room and board in select residence halls for NROTC scholarship recipients. Although the program emphasizes engineering and science majors, students may enroll in any Tuskegee University major leading to a baccalaureate degree. Navy Option scholarship students must complete two differential calculus courses by the start of their junior year and two calculus-based physics courses prior to the end of their junior year. Navy Option summer activities include two at-sea training cruises and one summer of career orientation lasting about four weeks each. Marine Option students report to the Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport, CA, in lieu of the second summer cruise and attend Officer Candidate School in Quantico, VA, their final summer before graduation. All scholarship students may resign without obligation any time prior to the beginning of their second year in the program. Successful completion of the NROTC program leads to a commission as an Ensign, U.S. Navy or Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps. Minority Serving Institution Scholarship Reservation (MSISR) Formerly known as Historically Black College and University or HBCU Scholarship, NROTC has a limited number of scholarships available for students that attend Minority Serving Institutions (MSI), which encompass Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), High Hispanic Enrollment (HHE) schools, and other Minority Institutions (MI). If you are interested in earning the MSISR to attend Tuskegee University, you must complete the electronic application at www.nrotc.navy.mil, which will be available through 31 December 2019. Only Navy Option applicants (those who agree to seek an Unrestricted Line (URL) commission as an officer in the U.S. Navy) are eligible for a MSISR. Marine Corps applicants are not eligible. Applicants may not be on active duty at the time of their application. Applicants previously disenrolled from the NROTC program for disciplinary or academic reasons are ineligible for an MSISR Scholarship. Applicants must have attained scores of at least 540 in Math and 550 in Critical Reasoning (CR)\/Evidence Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) on the SAT or 21 in Math and 22 in English on the ACT during a test taken no earlier than two years from the date of the application. A combination of test scores using the highest component Math and CR\/EBRW\/English scores for either SAT or ACT test may be used. Applicants with the minimum individual Math and Verbal scores and who respond positively to the MSISR interest question in the application are not required to meet the combined score in order to be eligible to apply and be considered on the MSISR selection board (Navy Option only). Applicants must complete the on-line National application and forward a copy to TU NROTC unit from which they are seeking a nomination. The application must be fully processed by the local Navy Recruiting Station and forwarded to Officer Development (OD) by our unit before receiving confirmation of acceptance. Applicants must complete the NROTC Statement of Understanding (NSTC 1533\/112), the Debarment Form (NSTC 1533\/102) and the Drug Statement Form (NSTC 1533\/101). The Director of NSTC OD will review and approve\/deny all applicants who, on the NSTC 1533\/101, answer \"yes\" to statement 1 or 2 concerning previous drug arrests or drug use. Applicants must apply to one of the NROTC-affiliated MSIs if not currently enrolled. Applicants must be admitted to the MSI in order to use their scholarship if selected. Applicants must demonstrate the ability to complete all Naval Science requirements and graduate on time with their assigned class year group by submitting a degree plan to the PNS of the MSI School the applicant wishes to attend. The degree plan must include all NROTC program and Naval Science course requirements. Applicants must have demonstrated leadership, integrity, and character by possessing some of the following characteristics: (a) Leadership and participation in a variety of school, extracurricular, community, or similar activities, particularly those with a charitable or public service purpose; (b) Receipt of civic or similar awards; (c) A history of overcoming personal adversity or the presence of other compelling factors, indicating that the student has a desire to succeed and the ability to overcome barriers; and (d) Being regarded as a role model by the teachers and peers at their high school. Not all the above factors need be present. The intent is to provide additional opportunities to all who, for any of the above or similar reasons, demonstrate potential for future success as a Naval Officer. 10. Applicants must conduct an NROTC Applicant Fitness Assessment (AFA) and provide their scores to their recruiter for inclusion in their application package in order for their application to be considered complete and forwarded for consideration to the selection board. The test consists of abdominal crunches, push-ups, and a one-mile run. The purpose of the test is to evaluate your level of physical fitness. The test can be administered by any physical education instructor, athletics coach, an active duty officer, active duty E-7 or NJROTC instructor. Applicants accustomed to regular physical activity should have no difficulty with the AFA. Being properly conditioned prior to reporting to your NROTC Unit cannot be overemphasized. You will be far better prepared to meet the stringent physical demands of the NROTC Program if you maintain a high level of physical fitness during high school. For Applicants with College Experience. Applicants must have completed no more than four academic terms totaling 30 semester credit hours (45 quarter hours) or less of college course work. MSISR nomination must be submitted via the NROTC Unit affiliated with the Minority Serving Institution you wish to attend. Make sure to include high school, ACT or SAT transcripts with applications, and any recommendation letters that you may have. To apply, you must complete the national scholarship and select YES for the \"interested in MSI\" option in the \"NROTC Interests\" section of the application, along with selecting Tuskegee University as one of your top 5 choices. The application deadline is midnight (CST) 31 December 2019. Once your application is fully processed, you will conduct an interview with a Tuskegee Naval ROTC staff officer to finalize your package and receive a nomination from the PNS. Selection results will be released in April by Naval Service Training Command (NSTC). The Tuskegee University NROTC recruiting officers' numbers are (334) 724-4203 or (334) 724-4994. USMC Frederick C. Branch (FCB) Scholarships The Frederick C. Branch Scholarship is an additional NROTC scholarship opportunity open to students planning to attend a participating Historically Black College or University (HBCU). Frederick C. Branch was the first African-American Marine Corps Officer. In May 1943, while attending Temple University, Branch received a draft notice from the Army, but he was ultimately selected to be a Marine. He went on to complete Basic Training at Montford Point, NC, and was assigned to serve in the Pacific. His conduct earned him the recommendation of his commanding officer to attend Officer Candidates School. On November 10, 1945, Frederick C. Branch was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. He went on to serve during the Korean War and attained the rank of Captain before leaving the Marine Corps in 1955. In his honor, the Marine Corps offers four-year, three-year and two-year NROTC scholarships for students attending or planning to attend a Historically Black College or University (HBCU). These scholarships are awarded to high school seniors or college freshmen and sophomores who seek to earn a commission in the United States Marine Corps while attending an HBCU. In general, students must have performed well academically in High School or, if in college, completed at least one semester of course work with a minimum 2.0 GPA and received a grade no lower than \"C\" in all attempted courses. Additionally, you must achieve a minimum SAT score of 1000 (combined math and critical reading only) or 22 combined on the ACT. This requirement is not waiverable. Students interested in applying for the scholarship may view this link: http:\/\/www.marines.com\/becoming-a-marine\/commissioning-programs\/four-year-colleges\/nrotc. Scholarships are extremely limited and highly competitive locally, so we encourage students to apply early. As a college student and Marine-Option Midshipman in the NROTC, your journey to a successful future will also lead to a life of purpose and advancement for which the Marine Corps Officers are known. For the right few, the Marine Corps offers the opportunity to pursue this noble path while earning a degree on a college campus. In fact, as a Marine-Option Midshipman, the NROTC Program will only enhance college life. But this is not merely an education, it is a screening process to find the few who have what it takes to lead Marines. College Program The College Program is a non-scholarship opportunity to participate in Naval ROTC and begin your career as a Naval Officer. It is available to incoming freshmen and sophomores who did not receive a four-year National Naval ROTC Scholarship (Navy or Marine Corps). Students applying for the College Program must first gain admission to Tuskegee University and then complete and submit the Current College Program application to this unit at the address listed below. The College Program consists of two categories: Basic and Advanced. Basic College Program students are freshmen and sophomores who, after acceptance into the program, will enroll in the regular naval science classes and labs, receive uniforms and naval science textbooks, and become full participants in the Naval Battalion. The Commanding Officer will then nominate qualified sophomores for selection to continue in the program as juniors and seniors, which is known as \u201CAdvanced Standing.\u201D In addition to the Basic benefits, an Advanced Standing College Program student receives a monthly stipend of $350 their junior year and $400 their senior year, but still receives no money for tuition or books. College Program students attend only one four-week summer training event which occurs between their junior and senior years. All scholarship awards are performance-based. Navy College Program students enjoy significant advantages over scholarship students such as the ability to choose any major (i.e. College Program students are not subject to a Tier system), no requirement to take Calculus and Physics and they are never obligated to their respective service while in college (e.g. a graduating College Program student may decline his or her commission without penalty up until they sign their Oath of Office after graduation). College Program Applications here Presidential Naval ROTC Preparatory Scholarship The Tuskegee University Presidential Naval ROTC Preparatory Scholarship provides economically and\/or academically disadvantaged applicants with a unique opportunity to earn a commission in the United States Navy. This scholarship provides an extra year of academics and military orientation focused on preparing students for NROTC success.
