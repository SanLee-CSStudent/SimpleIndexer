Many other students agree: In the past six years, enrollment in the Department of Computer Science has increased 318% and reached 920 undergraduates and graduate students in spring 2022. ANDREA MABRY | University RelationsEveryone knows that a computer science degree is a ticket to a bright future. The researchers at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics make the numerical argument: They note that software development, one common computer science career option, has a current median national pay of $110,140. And the BLS foresees 22% growth in openings \u2014 more than 400,000 new jobs \u2014 through 2030. Carlos Rivas-Valencia, a senior in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program in the UAB Department of Computer Science, sums up the appeal in terms of possibility. \u201CIt opens so many doors and opportunities,\u201D he said. \u201CI can dive into medicine, business, education or any other sector and go from building computer programs that help doctors better diagnose patients to working on the new self-driving cars.\u201D Rivas-Valencia is interested in becoming a software engineer. Even before he graduates, he will have completed internships at two big-name companies. Last summer, he had a software engineering role at Khan Academy, the open-education company, working alongside full-time engineers on the Frontend Infrastructure team, where he built new user-interface components, fixed bugs and wrote documentation on his changes. This summer, he will again be working as a software engineer at the San Francisco offices of Lyft \u2014 one of several companies that has made a major investment in self-driving cars. But not everyone starts out knowing they might be interested in a future in computer science. Amalee Dianne Wilson, a two-time UAB computer science grad (B.S. 2016, M.S. 2018) now pursuing her Ph.D. in the heart of Silicon Valley at Stanford University, started off in that group. \"I ended up taking a programming class, almost by accident, and was hooked. It was the most fun, challenging and interesting class that I had ever taken.\" \u201CA lot of people in computer science started programming when they were in their teens, but I was an adult-onset programmer,\u201D Wilson said. \u201CI was studying biochemistry and wanted to go to med school; but after my experiences in the emergency department, I realized that medicine wasn\u2019t for me. I ended up taking a programming class, almost by accident, and was hooked. It was the most fun, challenging and interesting class that I had ever taken.\u201D 300-plus percent growth You will hear similar adjectives from many computer science students and alumni. \u201CI like problem-solving and optimizing, and you get that a lot in this field,\u201D said Sonia Grzywocz, who graduated from UAB\u2019s Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science program in 2021 and now works as a full-stack software engineer for fintech\/cybersecurity company NXTsoft in Birmingham. \u201CI wanted something that would challenge me from the beginning and for the rest of my career.\u201D Chris Rocco, a 2019 graduate of the B.A. program, started out as an intern and then a full-time employee at Google and now works for YouTube, a Google subsidiary. Rocco has known that he was interested in software engineering since his early teens, and even considered a coding bootcamp program instead of getting a university degree. \u201CBut it\u2019s always better to have a college degree,\u201D he reasoned. \u201CAnd it\u2019s good to be around other people interested in the same thing.\u201D There are more students than ever in the UAB Department of Computer Science, notes Chair Yuliang Zheng, Ph.D. In spring 2016, soon after Zheng arrived to lead the department, there were 220 students enrolled \u2014 175 undergraduates and 45 graduate students. By spring 2022, there were 920 \u2014 568 undergraduates and 362 graduate students, enrolled across four undergraduate and four graduate programs (see \"Degree offerings\" box below). That is a 318% increase over six years. Related story The four Frees brothers, all dual bachelor\u2019s\/master\u2019s graduates of the Department of Computer Science between 2008 and 2021, illustrate the job options available to computer science graduates in Alabama. Jeffrey (B.S. 2008, M.S. 2010), the oldest, is a senior consultant at a global information technology consulting firm; Eric (B.S. 2009, M.S. 2011) is a software engineer at a construction software firm; Stephen (B.S. 2014, M.S. 2019) is a computer scientist for an avionics analysis corporation; and Jonathan (B.A. 2020, M.S., 2021), the youngest, is a system programmer at a computer forensics research lab. In the most recently available data, based on the First Destination survey of recent graduates, \u201C97 percent of our undergraduates have a job within six months of graduation \u2014 basically full employment \u2014 and I believe that is the highest rate at UAB,\u201D Zheng said. Most of these students work at Alabama companies, Zheng adds, although as the graduates above demonstrate, they can compete for positions at the country\u2019s elite companies and institutions as well. Of course, the same hot job market for students applies to faculty, who could make far more money in the private sector. \u201COur faculty are top-notch educators and leaders in their fields, and their efforts in particular over the past years as enrollment has grown are remarkable,\u201D Zheng said. But to keep up with enrollment, the faculty needs to expand, Zheng points out, and the department recently celebrated a landmark in this regard \u2014 its first endowed faculty position. A gift from alumnus David Brasfield (B.S. 1984), founder of NXTsoft, and his wife, Phyllis, has created the Phyllis and David Brasfield Endowed Faculty Scholarship in Computer Science. Endowed positions are common in medical schools, where recruitment has long been fierce, and the competition is heating up in computer science departments as well, Zheng notes. \u201CEndowed positions give us an edge when recruiting new faculty, and this gift is an important step forward as faculty are in high demand nationwide,\u201D Zheng said. Story continues below box Scholarships support future leaders, economy Sanjay Singh, Ph.D, and his wife, Dora (center), established the Dora and Sanjay Singh Scholarship for Computer Science in 2019. The Singhs are pictured above with scholarship recipients and computer science Chair Yuliang Zheng, Ph.D. (right).KeDarius Knight graduated with a B.A. degree in computer science in 2020 and now works as a software engineer in Birmingham with financial technology company FIS. While at UAB, Knight received the Dora and Sanjay Singh Scholarship for Computer Science, established by Birmingham tech entrepreneur and former Collat School of Business faculty member Sanjay Singh, Ph.D., and his wife. \u201CFor students who want to go to school but don\u2019t have the money, I want to help them see a pathway,\u201D Singh said. Scholarships \u201Chelp attract more talented students into our programs to learn from world-class experts who have state-of-the-art knowledge and skills in cybersecurity, machine learning, data science and mobile computing, all of which are indispensable to the economic development of the region and the state,\u201D said department chair Yuliang Zheng, Ph.D. In 2021, two undergraduates in computer science \u2014 Mamoudou Barry and Ayusha Khadka \u2014 received support with a gift from the Cadence Bank Computer Science Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program. \u201CWhen I moved to the United States in 2017, I faced many challenges, such as learning English and working double shifts; but my dream to become a computer scientist and the first in my family to graduate from college gave me the courage not to give up,\u201D Barry said. \u201C[Cadence Bank\u2019s] generosity is helping me to make my goals and dreams a reality.\u201D Scholarships give students an opportunity to expand their horizons as well. Fast Slow Motion, a Birmingham-based company founded by alumnus John Burdett (B.S. 2000), established the Fast Slow Motion Endowed Scholarship in Computer Science in February 2020. The first recipient was Isabelle Brown, a student in the B.S. in Computer Science program with plans for graduate study in computer science. \u201CThe Fast Slow Motion scholarship will allow me to take additional classes to further explore computer science ideas and topics,\u201D Brown said. \u201CThat will allow me to gain more skills to help both my future academic endeavors and my career goals.\u201D \u201CThis scholarship demonstrates our dedication to the advancement of Birmingham\u2019s technology ecosystem,\u201D Burdett said. \u201CFast Slow Motion is pleased to partner with UAB to recognize exceptional computer science talent and encourage them to begin their careers here.\u201D \u201CProgramming is becoming a new literacy\u201D An academic career has many kinds of rewards, says Professor John Johnstone, Ph.D., who was regularly cited by the alumni in this story as a standout educator. \u201CPerhaps the main reason I am drawn to teaching is the opportunity it offers to immerse yourself in a subject and to understand it deeply,\u201D Johnstone said. \u201CIt is indeed true that, to understand something, you should teach it. Teaching is also about trying to light the spark in someone else by clearly showing the beauty of a subject \u2014 and I always see a lot of beauty in the topics I teach.\u201D The combination of intellectual stimulation and the prospect of financial remuneration is a powerful attractor for students. \u201CThat is one of the unique things computer science offers \u2014 with a lot of four-year degrees, you don\u2019t necessarily have any guarantees that you will be able to support yourself; but computer science is lucrative,\u201D Wilson said. It is also ubiquitous. \u201CProgramming is becoming a new literacy. My colleagues who do research in biology, neuroscience and chemistry all use Python [a popular programming language] on a regular basis. Programming experience is a huge resume-booster across disciplines, and it\u2019s arguably crucial for doing research in most scientific fields. Enrollment is booming because people understand these benefits of a computer science degree.\u201D \"I like problem-solving and optimizing, and you get that a lot in this field. I wanted something that would challenge me from the beginning and for the rest of my career.\" The B.S. degree still has the highest enrollment in the department; but the B.A. degree, launched in 2016, is gaining quickly. The B.A. program was designed to allow students to combine a broad-based liberal arts education with a strong foundation in computer science, so that they become so-called T-shaped professionals. Students in the B.A. program must complete a minor to give them significant exposure to a second discipline. The program\u2019s core curriculum also fulfills typical computer science graduate school course prerequisites, so students can pursue graduate-level studies if they choose. (The department\u2019s Bioinformatics and Digital Forensics undergraduate programs are similarly interdisciplinary in focus and prepare students to start careers or move into graduate education. See box, \"Exciting and impactful.\") Rocco chose to minor in mathematics, both \u201Cbecause it is incredibly interesting by itself but also because it supplements computer science very well,\u201D he said. Grzywocz minored in social media strategies. \u201CI figured it would give me a better understanding of the target audience and how to make a product desirable,\u201D she said. \u201CI have already seen that benefiting me at work.\u201D Both alumni say they were attracted to the B.A. program because of its flexibility. \u201CThere are a lot of different careers out there, and the B.A. allows you to tailor your studies to fit your goals and aspirations,\u201D Grzywocz said. \u201CI appreciate being well-rounded and not having to take courses that are just related to your major,\u201D Rocco said. Founders and innovators One of the ways Rocco spent his time while at UAB was as part of the university\u2019s Student Accelerator program, where he received funding and support to launch his own web development company. That experience gave him \u201Ca lot of the necessary ingredients in developing a professional skillset,\u201D such as \u201Clearning to network and meeting new people who are also ambitious,\u201D Rocco said. \u201CAnd however you do it, if you start your own business, you are going to learn a lot no matter what happens. Fulfilling contracts with real companies is invaluable experience.\u201D UAB computer science alumni are no strangers to startup success. The group includes Adam Aldrich (B.S. 2007), president and founder of mobile app\/software development company Airship; Julie Hanna (B.S. 1987), founder of Scalix, an early innovator in open source email and calendaring software and current special adviser to Google\u2019s Moonshot Factory; James Wu (Ph.D. 2003), CEO and co-founder of DeepMap, which creates high-definition maps for autonomous vehicles; Stephen Brossette (Ph.D. 1998), co-founder of health-tech ventures MedMined Inc. and MedSnap LLC; and Darmesh Shah (B.S. 1994), co-founder and CTO of marketing and customer relationship management service HubSpot. Wilson\u2019s doctoral research at Stanford is focused on algorithms for parallel SMT solving (a type of automated reasoning), but she did not start out with an interest in an academic career. \u201CI started doing research as an undergrad because I thought it would make my resume look good when I started applying for software engineering jobs,\u201D Wilson said. But as she began working on compilers for high-performance computing with faculty Puri Bangalore, Ph.D., and Peter Pirkelbauer, Ph.D., the intellectual interest and challenge drew her in. After finishing her master\u2019s degree at UAB, she took a research position at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and now has a Department of Energy Computer Science Graduate Fellowship to help fund her doctoral studies. Her choice of Stanford University for her Ph.D. was strategic, Wilson adds. \u201CI want to start a company,\u201D she said. \u201CThe Bay Area is the best place for that.\u201D Degree offerings The UAB Department of Computer Science offers four undergraduate degrees: B.S. in Computer Science B.A. in Computer Science B.S. in Digital Forensics, a joint program with the Department of Criminal Justice B.S. in Bioinformatics, a joint program with the Heersink School of Medicine and Department of Biology that launched in 2019 The department has four graduate degrees: M.S. in Computer Science M.S. in Data Science M.S. in Cyber Security Ph.D. in Computer Science \u201CExciting and impactful\u201D In addition to the B.S. and B.A. programs in computer science, the department offers two interdisciplinary undergraduate programs: the B.S. in Digital Forensics, a joint program with the Department of Criminal Justice, and the B.S. in Bioinformatics, a joint program with the Heersink School of Medicine and Department of Biology. \u201CSome of the most exciting and impactful jobs are now in the field of computer science,\u201D said Professor John Johnstone, Ph.D., who co-directs the Bioinformatics program. A digital forensics major is a gateway to a cybersecurity role, one of the most in-demand tech-oriented jobs in Alabama and nationwide. And as modern medicine becomes more computational, programs like Bioinformatics serve as excellent pre-med disciplines, Johnstone adds. \u201CBioinformatics attracts a student who is interested in a broad education not only in computer science, but in the sister disciplines of biology and chemistry, with the goal of learning how to work computationally with the genome,\u201D Johnstone said. These students are \u201Cexcited about the application of computation and algorithmic thinking in computer science to the biomedical realm,\u201D he said. \u201CThis reflects a trend in modern science, where an interdisciplinary background is necessary to succeed in certain areas, with medicine being a perfect example.\u201D Published in Programs & Curricula back to top Programs & Curricula New summer program preps UAB freshmen for a budding doctor\u2019s biggest test: Bio 123 PEER-BUDS will counter COVID disruptions and school inequity by prepping 24 new biology majors with skills crucial to success in the lab and classroom.
