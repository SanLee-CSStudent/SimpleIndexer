We are just beginning to grasp how these determinants impact, and are impacted by, our environment, which in turn affects gene expression and individual susceptibilities to both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Read more from Dean Erwin Make a Difference How many times have you or someone else said that somebody should? We live in a world full of challenges.
