Mira WalkerTwo pianists studying at the University of Alabama at Birmingham will perform with the Alabama Symphony Orchestra on Saturday, April 16. College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 Department of Music alumna Mira Walker \u201920 and graduating senior Dina Kasman, both expert pianists, will each play a different piano concerto by Sergei Prokofiev. This inaugural ASO\/UAB Music Concerto Winners concert will be conducted by ASO Assistant Conductor Kevin Fitzgerald. The 7 p.m. performance will be in UAB\u2019s Alys Stephens Performing Arts Center. This is a free concert with general admission seating; no advance tickets are required. In the spring of 2020, ASO Principal Conductor Maestro Carlos Izcaray and Maestro Fitzgerald auditioned UAB Department of Music students for the opportunity to perform a concerto or aria with the ASO. Walker, then a senior, and Kasman, then a sophomore, were the winners of those auditions, and were scheduled to perform in April 2020. The performance was canceled. Walker went on to the Master of Music program in piano performance at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University. Dina KasmanWhen Fitzgerald reached out to Department of Music Chair Patrick Evans, D.M., about reviving the concert, Evans and Distinguished Professor in Music Yakov Kasman, DMA, worked together with the ASO staff to realize it. Kasman, a Van Cliburn silver medalist who directs UAB\u2019s piano program, is Dina Kasman\u2019s father. Fortunately, both Dina Kasman and Walker were working on different concerti by Sergei Prokofiev: Kasman on Piano Concerto No. 2 and Walker on Piano Concerto No. 3. Both pieces are among \u201Cthe most challenging and thrilling in all of the piano\/orchestral repertoire,\u201D Evans said. \u201COf all the lost opportunities we faced as a Department of Music over the last two years, this was one of the most disappointing, because of the professional performance these two exemplary students were forfeiting,\u201D Evans said. \u201CWe are grateful to Maestro Fitzgerald and the ASO to be able to present an even more exciting repertoire than it had originally programmed, and to bring Mira back to campus in the month that Dina is giving her senior recital and graduating.\u201D Walker was, and Kasman is, in the UAB Honors College. Kasman will graduate from UAB Saturday, April 30. Dina Kasman has announced she too will pursue her Master of Music degree in piano with Professor of Piano Norman Krieger at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music and has accepted an associate instructor position there. \u201CI am so unbelievably grateful for my time at UAB and in Birmingham,\u201D Kasman said on her announcement made to social media. \u201CI am so overwhelmed by the support I have received and am thankful for the people and opportunities that made UAB the best place for my undergraduate degree. A special thank you goes out to my dad for the past 11 years of endless hours and support as my teacher and mentor.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
