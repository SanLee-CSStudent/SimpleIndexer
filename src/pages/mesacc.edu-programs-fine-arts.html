Field of Interest People with an artistic eye tend to view the world differently than the average person and seek to communicate a new understanding through meaningful, visual messages. If you need to express yourself through art and want to go to art school to explore a range of art techniques, we\u2019ve designed our Fine Arts program to help you cultivate and hone your skills as an artist. Our exceptional, experienced instructors can inspire and teach you in different areas of specialization such as painting, ceramics, textiles, jewelry, sculpture, metals, photography, and drawing. With an associate degree in fine arts, you can pursue a career as a practicing artist or possibly work in a related field such as graphic design and eventually become a creative director. Going on to complete a bachelor\u2019s or graduate degree in fine arts at a university also allows you to pursue a career in museums, galleries, community-based art organizations, or art instruction. Make your art school dreams happen and join the Fine Arts program today. The Right Pathway for You MCC offers Certificates of Completion, Associate Degrees and Transfer Degrees for this program.
