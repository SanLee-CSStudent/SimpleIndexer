We believe in tackling the greatest global challenges of today and tomorrow through action-oriented, community-based inclusive excellence. Our institutional strength is fueled by the rich cultural tapestry made up of every member of our campus community that brings their true, authentic selves to Thrive, Excel, and Achieve at the University of Arizona! A Vision for Our Campus Responding to our Community Consistent with the University of Arizona\u2019s values of compassion and inclusion, the Office of Diversity & Inclusion (ODI) supports transgender Wildcat students, faculty, staff, and other community members. ODI understands that the impact of unequal treatment on transgender community members can be severe and dangerous. When one Wildcat is excluded, we are all implicated in the cost to human dignity. ODI encourages members of the University community to learn more about the experiences of our transgender colleagues and students and how they are impacted by discrimination. Please support student-led initiatives and projects aimed at strengthening the visibility, belonging, and safety of LGBTQ+ Wildcats. To learn more about transgender inclusion and ways to get involved write to inclusion@arizona.edu.
