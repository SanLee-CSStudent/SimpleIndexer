North Arkansas College is committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for our students, faculty and staff. To accomplish that goal, the college has established the Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT), which is charged with upholding policies and maintaining a safe environment for the college community. Being a college student presents a host of challenges. Sometimes those challenges can result in a student needing help in difficult times. The BIT works with students who need assistance with issues ranging from behavioral problems to threats of self-harm or harm to others. The BIT provides confidential, respectful, proactive support; while offering resources and balancing the educational needs of students with the mission of Northark. The BIT reaches out to students who seem to be hurting or struggling, and to help maintain a safe campus by intervening when potential red flag behaviors are identified. Reporting the issues of concern can assist the BIT in connecting students with the appropriate resources.
