A player of a team that forfeits out of a league without having played a game, may join another team. Any team that allows an ineligible player to participate shall forfeit the game(s) in which the ineligible player participated. Students whose names appear on an official intercollegiate athletic roster list shall be ineligible to compete in that sport, or any related sports. Playoff eligibility will be determined by the names on the roster. All players must play in at least one regular season game before being eligible for the playoffs. Both team captains must sign the scoresheet used at the end of each game played, in order to verify the final score recorded. Drug and alcohol will not be permitted at any activity. Playing or beingsuspected as playing under the influence of alcohol or another drug is cause for immediate ejection and removal from activity location. Sport Club Participants Definition: Any person who is listed on the roster, practices, or competes with a sport clubwhich is sponsored by the Student Government Association. Once a person is on a roster and\/or participates in a practice\/game that person is considered a member of that sport club for the entire academic school year. Eligibility rule: Intramural sports that consist of a playing field of 1-4 players are allowed 1 club player per team for that respective sport 5-8 players are allowed 2 club players per team for that respective sport 9-11 players are allowed 3 club players per team for that respective sport CLOTHING\/ACCESSORIES Jewelry: No jewelry or any other item deemed dangerous by the intramural staff may be worn during play. Any player wearing exposed permanent jewelry (i.e. body piercing) will not be permitted to play. There will be no hats, bandanas, or hard barrettes worn during play. Cloth (elastic) bands may be used to control the hair. Players may wear soft, pliable pads or braces on the leg, knee, and\/or ankle. Braces may not have any exposed metal and\/or screws. Braces made of any hard material (including plastic) must be covered with a padded sleeve or at least one-half inch padding for safety reasons. Under no circumstances will a player wearing a cast or splint be permitted to play. Eyeglasses: If eyeglasses are worn, they must be unbreakable. Each player is responsible for the safety of his\/her own glasses. A player with blood on his\/her clothing or body must leave the game immediately. The bleeding must be stopped and the open wound covered. If there is an excessive amount of blood on the uniform, it must be changed before the athlete may participate any further. FORFEITS, DEFAULTS Game time is forfeit time. A team not fielding the minimum number of players at game time for a contest shall receive a forfeit loss. If both teams fail to field the minimum number of players for a contest, both will receive a forfeit. One forfeit will result in a team being dropped from their league. The team will also pay a forfeit fee. NEW FORFEIT FEE -If a team fails to appear for a contest or forfeits a game, they will receive a notification from the intramural staff. The first forfeit in any season results in a $10 forfeit fee. This fee must be paid no later than 24 hours in advance of their next scheduledgame, in order for the team to be eligible to come back into the league or tournament. If payment is not made by the deadline, the team will be dropped from the league or tournament. Payments for forfeit fees can be made at the Campus Recreation Center inthe form of cash, check or credit card. Captain is responsible for forfeits and will be suspended in IMLeagues for any future leagues\/IM sports until forfeit fee is paid. To avoid forfeit fee, a team captain must default the game as explained below. After paying initial forfeit fee to be reinstated into the league, any future defaults or forfeits in the same league will result in an additional $10 fee. Campus Recreation encourages the use of defaults instead; to communicate when a team knows in advance they will not be able to field enough players for a game. Teams may request to default one contest during the regular season, provided the request is done by 2:00pm the day of the contest. The team will still receive a loss, but not a forfeit. If there are additional defaults\/forfeits after the second default, the team will be taken out of the league. CANCELLATIONS If a disagreement should arise between a player and an official\/supervisor concerning the interpretation of the rules, or a question on a participant\u2019s eligibility, a protest may be made by the team captain to the supervisor. All protests must be made at the time the dispute arises and before play is resumed. The captain must complete the protest form and submit it to the Coordinator of Competitive Sports (This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. ) no later than 5pm the next day. The protest fee is $10 and will be returned to the team\/captain if the protest is upheld, and the game will be replayed from the point of protest. Misapplication of the rules and participant eligibility are the only elements of the contest that may be protested. Officials\u2019 judgment calls may not be protested. In case of a disagreement between players in matches without officials, a re-match will be scheduled and an official or supervisor will be assigned if needed. PLAYOFFS Playoff tournaments will be single elimination and may be scheduled at different times than league play took place. Teams will be seeded based on regular season records and sportsmanship ratings. Please see IMLeagues.com for more details. A team must have at least a \"B\" average to be eligible for the playoffs. Winning percentage and sportsmanship will be the two factors taken into consideration when teams are selected for playoffs. SPORTSMANSHIP The intramural staff will assign a sportsmanship rating to each team, following the conclusion or each game. Sportsmanship ratings will be used to determine playoff eligibility and standing. The following scale will be used to determine rating: \u201CA\u201D= Excellent conduct and sportsmanship \u201CB\u201D= Good conduct and sportsmanship \u201CC\u201D= Average conduct and sportsmanship \u201CD\u201D= Below average conduct and sportsmanship \u201CF\u201D= Poor conduct and sportsmanship A team must have at least a \u201CB\u201D average or better during the regularseason to be eligible for playoffs. A team winning a game by forfeit or default will receive an \u201CA\u201D rating. A team losing a game by forfeit or default will receive no rating. FRATERNATY\/SORORITY LEAGUES Only one team from a fraternity\/sorority will be allowed to participate in the Fraternity\/Sorority Leagues. All remaining teams must compete in the independent leagues. Players may not participate on more than 1 men\u2019s\/women\u2019s and co-rec team.
