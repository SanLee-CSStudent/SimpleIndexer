UAF\u2019s plan was established to assist students with the greatest need, in accordance with federal guidelines. Awards have been broken into two separate categories: UAF CARES Relief Grant Students who were identified as having the greatest need were selected based on Estimated Family Contribution(EFC) range from information provided on the FAFSA and the number of face-to-face classes that were switched to online in March. A total of $1,025.805.00 (99% of the CARES initial allocation) has been awarded to 2011 students who qualify for this category. Students need not apply for this award, it has already been posted to student accounts and refunds will occur starting April 30. Recipients of this group were notified directly via email and text message. UAF CARES Additional Relief Grant $7,521 (<1% of the CARES initial allocation) has been awarded to 5 students as Emergency Scholarships. This provided a mechanism, for those students who did not meet the greatest need criteria, to apply for assistance with qualifying expenses due to the coronavirus disruption. Students awarded from either category were met the following criteria: Enrolled in in-person spring 2020 semester course Admitted as a degree-seeking student to UAF Completed a valid 2019-2020 FAFSA Eligible for Title IV funding Maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP) * This serves as acknowledgement that the institution signed and returned to the Department the Certification and Agreement and the assurance that the institution has used, or intends to use, no less than 50 percent of the funds received under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act to provide Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students. The estimated total number of students at the institution eligible to participate in programs under Section 484 in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, and thus eligible to receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants to students under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act, is 2011.
