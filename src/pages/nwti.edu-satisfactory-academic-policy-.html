These standards are applicable to recipients of the following programs: Federal Pell Grant, Arkansas Workforce Improvement Grant and the Go! Opportunity Grant Regardless of what type of financial aid assistance a student is receiving. All students are required to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards. Satisfactory academic progress is evaluated at the end of each semester during the regular academic year. Students attending summer sessions are evaluated at the end of the summer session. Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards apply to all work attempted at NWTI even though a student may not have been receiving financial aid. Minimum Standards of Progress QUALITATIVE: A minimum 2.0 cumulative grade point average (GPA) is required for all coursework at NWTI. QUANTITATIVE: The pace of progression to ensure completion within the 150% maximum time frame is a cumulative completion of 67% of all hours attempted. Attempted hours include withdrawals, repetitions, test outs, and transfer credits. Test outs and transfer hours also count as completed hours. Credit hours completed are: \u201CA\u201D through \u201CD\u201D grades \u201CS\u201D satisfactory Credit hours attempted but not completed are: \u201CF\u201D grades \u201CW\u201D withdrawal \u201CI\u201D incomplete The number of credit hours a student may attempt while continuing to receive financial aid cannot exceed 150% of the number of credit hours required for completion of the program of study. Transfer students will be assumed to be making satisfactory progress for the first disbursement of financial aid funds. Cumulative GPA for transfer students is based on NWTI academic work only. However, credits transferred from other institutions will be used to evaluate program completion within the 150% maximum. A student may change to a different major and continue to receive financial aid if satisfactory academic progress is maintained. Credit hours taken in the initial program will count against the maximum hours allowed in a subsequent program. Academic\/Financial Aid Warning A student aid is placed on Academic\/Financial Aid Warning when he\/she fails to maintain a 2.0 cumulative grade point average or fails to complete at least 67% of all hours attempted in a term regardless of whether he or she is receiving financial aid assistance. A student on warning status continues to receive financial aid. Academic\/Financial Aid Termination Academic\/Financial Aid Termination means termination of all financial aid and suspension from NTI. If a student does not meet the minimum standards of progress by the end of the warning period, the student is considered to be making unsatisfactory progress and is placed on Academic\/Financial Aid Termination. Following suspension, a student may return to warning status when he\/she regains a 2.0 cumulative GPA and completes at least 67% of all hours attempted within a term. After returning to warning status, a student must continue to maintain the appropriate cumulative grade point average and completion rate or he\/she will return to suspended status. Warning status remains with a student through subsequent terms even if he\/she continues to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. A student who withdraws from NWTI and re-enrolls at a later date will return with a financial aid status as determined at the end of the last semester attended. A student who receives financial aid and who does not meet the minimum Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards will be notified by the Financial Aid Office by letter mailed to the most current address on file. Academic Probation A status granted only after the student has had their appeal approved by the Academic Progress Appeal Committee. The Academic Probation can either be for one semester or multiple semesters, deemed by the Appeal Committee. At the end of the probation period, the student must meet SAP standards to maintain Pell eligibility. Financial Aid Probation A status granted only after the student has had their appeal approved by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee.
