The Executive Board is composed of a president, vice-president, secretary\/treasurer, and chief justice. Senators are selected by quorum with three senators from each college, two senators with undeclared majors, and two freshman senators. Associate justices are appointed by the chief justice with the approval of the president. In addition to presenting concerns and recommendations from the student body to the colleges and administration, SGA is actively involved in the coordination of homecoming activities and community service. The justices serve to resolve parking appeals and supervise student government elections. Elections are held in the spring to select executive board members for the following school year, and freshmen senators are elected the following fall. SGA meets each Monday at 4 p.m. in Reynolds 210. Meetings are open to the student body. Parking ticket appeals may be brought to the Office of Student Life in Reynolds 101 for review by the justices.
