Faculty Contact Jacob Williams EMT\/Paramedic Program Director (870) 391-3125 jacob.williams@northark.edu Program Goals Recognize a medical emergency, assess the situation, and manage emergency care and extrication, if necessary. Establish rapport with the patient and his\/her significant others to alleviate their state of crisis. Assign priorities of emergency treatment and record and communicate data to the designated medical command authority. Coordinate efforts of agencies involved in the care and transportation of the patient. Initiate and continue emergency medical care under medical control, including the recognition of presenting medical conditions and initiation of appropriate non-invasive and invasive therapies. Exercise personal judgment in case of interruption in medical direction caused by communications failure or in cases of life threatening conditions using protocols specifically authorized in advance. Learning Outcomes Graduates of the EMT Program will distinguish the nature and seriousness of the patient\u2019s medical condition and extent of traumatic injuries, and treat the patient within the scope of our-of-hospital emergency medical care. EMT graduates will demonstrate proper lifting, moving, positioning and otherwise handling of the patient to minimize discomfort, prevent further injury, and perform safely and effectively the expectations of the EMT job description. Graduates will exhibit operational knowledge in such areas as communications, transportation, keeping records and laws related to EMS and healthcare practice. Graduates will exhibit cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills in out-of-hospital care dealing with environmental safety of the accident\/trauma patient. Licensure and Certification The student must pass the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) exam. Students graduating from Northark\u2019s EMS programs meet the requirements to take the NREMT exam and are eligible to apply to states that require the NREMT for state licensure. Upon the successful completion of the NREMT exam, the student becomes Nationally certified. This is a National certification but not a state license. After graduation, EMT and paramedic students must apply to the desired state to become state-licensed. We are unsure of other specific licensure qualifications that some states may require. Some states specify more stringent requirements and it would be up to the student to look up the requirements for those states. Medical Responder Course The medical responder is a 2-credit class that is completed in one semester. In Arkansas, there currently is not a certification exam for the medical responder. If you\u2019re not sure you want to work on an ambulance then try taking the medical responder course. This course will provide you skills that you can use to help your community or your family. This Department of Transportation course will provide you training that will cover those medical responder tasks that are so vital early in the EMS response. Many area rural fire departments use medical responders to assist the local EMS services to provide that life-saving care before the ambulance arrives. There is no certification exam. Single Course Requirement EMS 1022 Emergency Medical Responder 2 credit hours Sample costs for Medical Responder tuition for 2 hours: Boone County - $166 (includes mandatory fees) In- State - $216 (includes mandatory fees) Out of State - $362 (includes mandatory fees) Text - $76 (average cost) This program is not financial-aid eligible.
