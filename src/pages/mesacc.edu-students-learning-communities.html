In learning community courses, students work closely with one another and with their instructors. Student success is elevated because course content is integrated and presented in a meaningful way. MCC offers two types of learning communities: partially-integrated and integrated academic support. Enroll TODAY! Use the MCC course search tool to filter learning community courses. Partially-Integrated Learning Communities In a partially-integrated learning community, students enroll into two linked courses that share complementary learning objectives. Instructors teaching the courses spend time integrating concepts across both courses, and there is at least one shared assignment. Even though students are enrolled into these course concurrently, the grades for each course are independent. If you would like to enroll into this type of learning community, use the course search feature and select \"Learning Communities.\" Find a course with the note: \"This course is half of a partially integrated learning community with XXX###(Section), with which it shares some topics and assignments. Students must enroll in this course and its co-requisite.\" Spring 2022 Partially-Integrated Learning Communities COURSE CODE COURSE TITLE SECTION LOCATION INSTRUCTOR COURSE CODE COURSE TITLE SECTION LOCATION INSTRUCTOR ARH102 Renaissance through Contemporary Art 27613 Live Online Th 10:30AM-11:45AM Lindsey Pedersen SOC101 Introduction to Sociology 27937 Live Online Tu 10:30AM-11:45AM Paul Harasha COM100 Introduction to Human Communication 29138 On Your Own Time Online Puvana Ganesan PHY101 Introduction to Physics 28689\/28690 SD Campus MW 9:00AM-11:45AM Leann Thompson Integrated Academic Support In an integrated academic support learning community, RDG100LL: Disciplinary Literacy Lab is linked to an academic content course.
