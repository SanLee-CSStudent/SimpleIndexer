I know I'm building a friendship that will last long after I graduate from JBU.\u201D \u201CEvery week we get together, drink coffee, eat dinner, and we study the Word together. I've learned so much and I'm so thankful for this kind of community in my life.\u201D \"Worshiping God with my fellow students is amazing. The teaching not only helps me dive into the scriptures, but it also helps me apply them to my world and the world around me.\" \u201CMy friends and I love to walk to downtown Siloam and grab our favorite coffee at Pour Jon's. It's one of my favorite places to hang out.\u201D \u201CAfter a long day of classes, my friends and I love to hit the gym. Working out together is such a great way to unwind and connect. We leave feeling awesome and positive.\u201D Get involved \u201CAs a resident assistant, I love coming home from school and hanging out with the girls on my hall. It's in the midst of those everyday moments, that they will often share their struggles, and I can encourage and pray for them.\u201D \"What's fun about being part of the Cathedral Choir is that it's made up of students from every major, and I've become best friends with people I probably wouldn't have met otherwise.\" \u201CIn the Red Steps, we create together, write our own music, and plan setlists that fit the group we are leading in worship. And then we get to be the hands and feet of Jesus \u2013 listening to people and hearing their stories.\u201D \u201CBecause English is my second language, I can relate to kids in our community who are learning English for the first time. Through friendship, mentoring, and tutoring, our goal is to show them that college is a real possibility\u201D \u201CWhen I help these kids express themselves through their art, I'm fueling their artistic passion, as well as my own. I grow in my own creativity because I'm helping kids develop theirs.\u201D \u201CAs part of the Great Abandon Dance Ministry, I get to share the message of the Gospel through dance. Performing has deepened my relationship with Jesus, and it's incredible to watch our audience respond in powerful ways.\u201D \u201CFor me, there's nothing like the thrill of performing live. I love giving the audience a chance to journey with the cast through a story, and to be changed by the performance.\u201D Have fun and enjoy life \u201CThey have all of these llamas and turtles and snakes and we get to come and take a break from studying for finals and hang out with them. It's just a really fun time.\u201D \"Owning a hammock at JBU is almost as important as textbooks. Where else are you going to do your homework, take an afternoon nap, or hang with your friends?\" \u201CI was able to show off my God given skills for a huge crowd of friends and fellow students and receive feedback from judges that are actually working in the recording industry.\u201D \u201CIt's awesome to know that JBU recognizes the stress that we're under, and gives an opportunity for us to just relax and have a fun time before finals begin.\u201D \u201CThe guys I play with are like my brothers. We work so hard, and we grow together on and off the field. It's really been an incredible experience to be on this team.\u201D \u201CMy friends and I play on an intramural team, and we have loved being able to take a break from studying to have fun, and be active, while competing in different sports that we love.\u201D Explore #jbulife on Instagram Get an authentic glimpse into life at JBU. #jbulife is reserved for real students to post candidly about life as a JBU student.
