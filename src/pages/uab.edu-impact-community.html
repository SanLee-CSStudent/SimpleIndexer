The institutions themselves partake in a number of activities that support local businesses and nonprofits to be successful. The following are a handful of the community activities in which UAB engages with the immediate as well as broader communities: UAB Benevolent Fund \u2013 The UAB Benevolent Fund, established and governed by employees, recognizes the importance of supporting the community.

Diversity at UAB Consistently ranked by The Princeton Review as one of the most diverse universities in the nation (with faculty, staff and students from more than 110 countries), UAB provides an inclusive environment for the pursuit of excellence in education, research, health care, outreach and economic development. Because of its commitment to diversity and inclusion in all aspects of its mission, UAB is able to bridge cultural boundaries through the transmission of knowledge and ideas, the provision of health and human services, and the shared experience of art. For example: The UAB Office for Equity and Diversity provides effective leadership in the development, coordination, implementation and assessment of a comprehensive array of programs to promote diversity and understanding of differences at UAB. UAB Student Multicultural and Diversity programs serve the UAB community, especially students, by developing programs and resources that promote multicultural and social justice awareness, education and appreciation.
