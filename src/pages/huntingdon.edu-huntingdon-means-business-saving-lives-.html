In neighboring state Alabama, six-month-old Davis Boswell\u2019s parents, tried and true Auburn Tiger fans, waited and hoped as their son\u2019s condition worsened, in desperate need of a heart transplant. And that\u2019s how the heart of one little tiger became the heart of another little tiger. The two families later united over the football rivalry that divides many in the two states and continue working together to inspire others to donate life through organ and tissue donation. In healthcare, the business of organ, eye, and tissue donation and transplantation is somewhat a high-wire act: tiptoeing on a tightrope between one family\u2019s worst nightmare and despair and another patient\u2019s only hope for survival or normalcy. In the United States, there are 57 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) approved by the federal government, and 83 eye banks. Four Huntingdon alumni work on the staffs of two of those organizations, Advancing Sight Network and Legacy of Hope. Both organizations are based in Birmingham. Teresa Carver Ham \u201985 serves as the chief administrative officer for Advancing Sight Network, overseeing accounting, human resources, marketing, and education. She also serves the donation community at large as the secondary team leader and treasurer for Donate Life Alabama, a collaboration of Advancing Sight and Legacy of Hope to educate the community on the importance of organ, eye, and tissue donation; as chair of the Eye Bank Association of America\u2019s Donor, Partner, and Community Relations Committee; and as vice-chair of Donate Life America\u2019s Advisory Committee. \u201CMy favorite story is from a cornea recipient who is also a member of a donor family,\u201D says Teresa. \u201CKim tells the story of her mom being a huge supporter of organ donation who encouraged her family to become donors. Kim remembers feeling disappointed when, following her mom\u2019s death, she could only donate her mother\u2019s corneas due to her mom\u2019s medical condition. Kim didn\u2019t understand how significant that gift was until years later when she unexpectedly needed a cornea transplant. A serious eye injury left Kim blind in one eye. [Because of the transplant] her vision is restored. She says, \u2018My cornea donor\u2019s selfless gift means everything to me and my family.\u2019 Kim is a wife, a mother of six, and an artist.\u201D All four alumni who work in the donation field arrived in their roles from far different paths traveled after graduation from Huntingdon. Teresa, a marketing major, Chi Omega, Student Government Association public relations chair and Huntingdon Ambassador at HC, graduated with no idea what she wanted to do professionally, so she stayed put, serving as an admission counselor. \u201CI wanted to share with other potential students what it was like to be a Huntingdon Hawk,\u201D she says. After marriage to her Huntingdon sweetheart, James Ham \u201985, and working in a few other sales positions, she transitioned to human resources and then, in 2002, to the nonprofit world with Advancing Sight Network. \u201CAdvancing Sight Network\u2019s mission is to provide sight to the visually impaired through transplant and research,\u201D says Teresa. \u201CEvery day I get to be a part of the miracle of helping someone see. It\u2019s really a gift of hope. The stories that I hear and the donor families and recipients that I have the privilege of meeting give extraordinary meaning and purpose to the work that I do. One of my personal values is to be a light to others. My work at Advancing Sight allows me to literally be a part of the process of bringing light into the lives of others!\u201D Dima Pacha McCuiston \u201999 joined Advancing Sight Network recently after nine years as a pharmaceutical representative and work in the nonprofit sector for the cause of diabetes. A human performance and kinesiology major at Huntingdon, Dima was the number one player on the tennis team for three of her four years (most valuable player and senior captain, as well), a member of Alpha Omicron Pi, vice president for College Republicans, and chair of the Panhellenic Council. Always having a heart to help, she cocreated and hosted SuperSports Saturdays with Dr. Lisa Olenik Dorman, teaching children with disabilities play and movement through wheelchair tennis, wheelchair basketball, and swimming. Today, in addition to her work as vice president of partner relations with Advancing Sight Network, she has served as a health, fitness, and Zumba instructor for the YMCA. \u201CI love working for a mission to help others with the gift of sight and to find cures for those struggling with eye disease in Alabama and all over the world,\u201D she says. Jarryd Keene \u201912 and Cindy Smith Stoffregen \u201992 work with Legacy of Hope, where he is a partner services liaison, and she is the regulatory compliance coordinator. Jarryd is responsible for building relationships with key hospital personnel while helping to define, shape, and guide individuals\u2019 roles in the donation process. Cindy ensures that the organization maintains compliance with federal regulations and sustains accreditation through the American Association of Tissue Banks by managing the internal audit program. \u201CLegacy of Hope is a nonprofit organization that is the federally designated organ procurement organization for the state of Alabama,\u201D says Jarryd. \u201CWe coordinate organ and tissue donation for transplant and research. Legacy of Hope is a mission-driven organization that builds broad-reaching alliances to educate people about the importance of organ and tissue donation. As an organ procurement organization, we are an entity legally permitted to recover organs from deceased donors and provide support to donor families. We also play a role in identifying potential organ donors, requesting authorization from donor families, procuring organs, working closely with other agencies to identify potential transplant recipients, and coordinating the transfer of recovered organs to transplant hospitals. Legacy of Hope consists of a leadership team, administrative team, multiple clinical teams, public education, family care, professional education, and a quality team that all play vital roles in our daily success as an organization.\u201D \u201CThere are currently more than 100,000 people in the U.S. waiting to receive a life-saving organ transplant, 1,233 of whom are in Alabama,\u201D says Cindy. \u201CThe United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) maintains a database of all potential organ recipients nationwide. Before an organ is allocated, all transplant candidates on the waiting list who are incompatible with the donor because of blood type, height, weight, and other medical factors are automatically screened from any potential matches. Then the computer application determines the order the other candidates will receive offers, according to national policies maintained by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). Blood type and other medical factors weigh into the allocation of every donated organ, but there are other factors that are unique to each organ type, such as waiting time, medical need, and distance from the donor hospital. Once the gifts are placed, Legacy of Hope\u2019s procurement transplant coordinator arranges for the procurement and typically within 48\u201372 hours the gifts are transplanted into the recipients.\u201D For eye and tissue donations, there are fewer medical restrictions. Once a potential donor is identified, Advancing Sight and Legacy of Hope share a call center that screens the patient\u2019s medical history to determine if they are medically eligible to be a donor, explains Teresa. \u201CEye donation is not as restrictive as organ donation in that there is no match necessary for age, gender, race, blood type, etc. If a patient is eligible and is a registered donor, the family is notified and the recovery logistics are coordinated.\u201D \u201CTo comply with federal regulations all OPOs must be non-profit organizations,\u201D says Cindy. \u201CThere is no financial cost to any family to donate their loved one\u2019s organs, eyes, or tissues, and current legislation regarding donation does not allow an OPO to provide any type of compensation to the donor family heroes who selflessly give the gift of life to others.\u201D \u201CI had absolutely no knowledge of the organ procurement world when I graduated from college,\u201D says Jarryd, who majored in athletic training\/sports medicine, was an athlete on the men\u2019s soccer team, and shadowed the College\u2019s Certified Athletic Trainers with the intention of following that career path. But he needed a job as he planned marriage to his Huntingdon love, Noele Mathis \u201912, and through direction from the Center for Career and Vocation he matched with Motivated Movers, where he advanced from driver\/crew chief to general manager during the next seven years. He then joined the staff of Allyalign Health as a client services advocate, and then moved to Legacy of Hope in October 2020. \u201CI will say my career plan when I graduated versus now is far off from what I had expected. However, I believe my personal goals and values have stayed consistent. I have always had intentions for my career to be focused on service to others, while working in some capacity of health and safety.\u201D Like Jarryd and Teresa, Cindy also married her Huntingdon sweetheart, Edward (Trey) Stoffregen III \u201992. She says, \u201CTo this day my college friends are still my best friends, including my husband.\u201D A psychology major, Cindy was active in the Environmental Awareness and Action Club and the Behavioral Sciences Club, and a Jan Term course that took her on a trip to Big Bend National Park in Texas led to a continuing friendship with emeritus English professor Dr. Richard Anderson. \u201CI loved my classes, my professors, the dorm experience, and my friends. I was challenged academically at Huntingdon, and I grew intellectually and emotionally during my time there.\u201D After graduation, Cindy worked in behavioral health, earning a master\u2019s degree in rehabilitation counseling, licensure as a professional counselor (LPC), and an Education Specialist degree. Work in the quality improvement office of a psychiatric practice opened the door for her entry into the field of healthcare compliance. She joined Legacy of Hope in 2017. \u201CIn looking back, I realize my personal and professional growth was only possible because I took advantage of opportunities as they arose, even if they didn\u2019t exactly follow what seemed a \u2018normal\u2019 career path given my licensure,\u201D says Cindy. \u201CI think a liberal arts education simply nurtured my natural tendencies to be curious and open-minded, and to not let fear or uncertainty hold me back.\u201D \u201CI have no doubt that my liberal arts education at Huntingdon helped me prepare for the professional world,\u201D agrees Jarryd. \u201CIt allowed me to understand the importance of thinking outside the box. In the professional world I believe you must be well-rounded and always willing to adapt to the environment around you. A lot of the important skills I learned at Huntingdon aren\u2019t taught at most colleges.\u201D \u201CI loved that I had the freedom to explore lots of academic interests unrelated to my major [at Huntingdon],\u201D says Teresa. \u201CI grew up in a faith-based family and was active in my small-town church. The \u2018required\u2019 religion classes taught me so much more! In addition, I was able to explore interests in political science, art and philosophy. It gave me a chance to spread my wings and see what my true interests and passions really were.\u201D Dima says she loved the diverse curriculum, allowing her to explore history, religion, psychology, literature, and art in addition to her major. \u201CI loved the small campus, loved my teachers \u2026 classes outside on the Green \u2026 the computer I got when I started, and the travel and Jan Term opportunities!\u201D For all four alumni, the Huntingdon motto, \u201CEnter to grow in wisdom, go forth to apply wisdom in service,\u201D has either served as a cornerstone or put words to a belief they held before coming to Huntingdon. \u201CI think it is so important to take all of life\u2019s lessons (wisdom) and find a way to share them with others (service). I have tried to make that a hallmark in both my personal and professional life by mentoring and coaching and giving back to the community in which I live and work,\u201D says Teresa. \u201CGod blessed me at a young age with the drive to always listen and learn in everything I do and every encounter I experience in life,\u201D says Jarryd. \u201CI believe I have always been prepared to go into things with the mentality of gaining wisdom. I do believe that once the Huntingdon motto became a part of my everyday life it played a huge role in helping me actually understand the importance of how to truly apply my wisdom in service. This has definitely helped me excel in my professional career and beyond.\u201D To each of these alumni, their work is a mission that brings hope, inspired by the selfless acts of the donors and donor families. \u201CI can\u2019t say enough about our donor families,\u201D says Cindy. \u201CIn the moment of utmost despair they choose to focus on the legacy their loved one could leave behind.\u201D One of Cindy\u2019s favorite stories is of Jan Jones, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 8. At 37 her kidneys began to fail and she needed a transplant. \u201CJan was blessed with a kidney-pancreas transplant on May 18, 2011, and she has never looked back. She lives a life full of gratitude for her donor. Since her transplant, she started her own business, has gotten married, and spends much of her free time advocating for organ, eye, and tissue donations.\u201D Teresa shares the story of Danny, an 18-year-old man who was diagnosed with a disease that causes vision to worsen rapidly. \u201CWithin a week, Danny was on an operating table receiving a corneal transplant in one eye, and he would later undergo another transplant in the other eye. His vision was saved by two generous donors who made his sight-saving transplants possible. Later, when Danny\u2019s father-in-law needed a kidney transplant, he felt called to give back. He was a match, and gratefully agreed to be a living kidney donor. His father-in-law\u2019s surgery was successful, and Danny says the decision to donate was easy. He said, \u2018You never lose in life when you make the choice to give.\u2019\u201D April is National Donate Life Month. Becoming an organ, eye, and tissue donor in Alabama is as simple as visiting www.registerme.org, registering on the health app on your iPhone, or making the designation when obtaining or renewing a driver\u2019s license. Be sure to share your donation decision with your family. For questions about organ or tissue donation, contact Legacy of Hope at www.legacyofhope.org or (800) 252-3677.
