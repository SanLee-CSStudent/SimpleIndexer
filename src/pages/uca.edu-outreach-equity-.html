The first part of the series (Diversity & Belonging) was held in the fall. The next part (Inclusion & Equity) will start in March. Each session will be approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. The College of Education has adopted the Diversity, Belonging, Inclusion and Equity (DBIE) model to guide how equity and social justice will be centered and advanced in education and the community. Following that model, the Fall 2021 focused on diversity and belonging; the Spring 2022 series will focus on inclusion and equity. The series is geared toward those working in education, community organizing, social justice advocacy, social services, and leaders of organizations with social missions. The series will culminate with a pre-conference capstone session on Wednesday, May 11, 2022. (Note the time change for the capstone session.) The Centering Equity Conference will be held on Thursday, May 12, 2022.
