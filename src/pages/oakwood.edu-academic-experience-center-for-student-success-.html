Program Give UNCF Golf Select Page Center for Student Success Blessings & Breakthroughs: Highlights of the October 2021 Board Meeting The mission of CSS is to help students thrive at Oakwood University and beyond, by providing academic and transitional support. Utilizing a holistic approach, we develop services that empower students to take responsibility for their learning. Programs and Services Academic Advising The goal of academic advising is to help each student follow an individualized path through the curriculum, allowing that student to meet his or her personal, professional, and academic goals. Advisers also serve as a primary point of contact with the University. Students should always inform their Advisers if they are experiencing particular problems in class, suffering health issues that interfere with their studies, or are encountering other unforeseen events that pose a challenge to their academic success. Advisers work with their students to resolve the issues, often seeking assistance from administrators or partner offices, as necessary. Beyond academics, Advisers also provide guidance on achieving personal and professional goals. They often advise students on pursuits outside of the classroom and help students coordinate their academic choices with emerging career goals. Academic & Financial Challenges click here Disability Services Disability Services empowers students with disabilities to realize their academic and personal potential by facilitating equal access and coordinating accommodations and support services for eligible students. This approach is consistent with the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and places an emphasis on a student\u2019s ability and independence.
