North Arkansas College (NAC) students can now enjoy a seamless pathway to earn Missouri State University degrees. Missouri State Provost Dr. Frank Einhellig and Northark President Dr. Rick Massengale Sr. met in Harrison today (March 4) to sign a new articulation agreement. Under this agreement, the two institutions will work together to develop transfer plans for NAC students who want to complete their bachelor\u2019s degrees at Missouri State \u2013 either online or at the Springfield campus. It promotes the completion of bachelor's degrees within 120 credits. \u201CThis is the first of what we hope are many more future partnerships with MSU,\u201D Dr. Rick Massengale commented. \u201CTransfer partnerships with universities such as MSU are gateways to furthering one's education and help prepare our students for life after NAC.\u201D About transfer 2+2 plans The transfer 2+2 plans offer a clear pathway to a bachelor\u2019s degree and ensure students meet program requirements. Students will also be assured of course transferability for all programs through this agreement. Ultimately, students can save time and money with these transfer 2+2 plans. \u201CAt Missouri State, our goal is to offer a quality, affordable higher education to students who want a degree,\u201D Einhellig said. \u201CThis new partnership reflects that commitment and we\u2019re excited to welcome more NAC students to Missouri State.\u201D North Arkansas College is committed to providing an educational and work environment for its students, faculty, and staff that is free from sexual discrimination including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and sexual violence.
