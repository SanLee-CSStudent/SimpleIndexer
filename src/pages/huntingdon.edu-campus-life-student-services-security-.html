The Campus Security office is located in the Wilson Center, Room 112. Security officers may be reached by telephone at 334-324-6565. Emergency Management Plan Security Phones Security phones are located outside each residence hall and in the Searcy and Narrow Lane parking lots. Escort Service Campus Security provides an escort service for those who are traveling across campus at night and for those who have mobility challenges, whether temporary or permanent. You may call (334) 324-6565 to request security assistance. Register Your Vehicle During the first week of classes, register your vehicle and obtain a parking permit in the Security Office (Wilson 112). You will need to know your driver\u2019s license and license plate numbers, along with the make and model of your vehicle. Parking permits are issued at no charge. Security Measures Campus Security has the authority to detain suspects and to make arrests within certain guidelines under the provisions of state law. Should any criminal activity occur at an off-campus event recognized by the College, Campus Security will be notified. Student Identification Safety Tips Building Security To maintain security, academic buildings are locked at 10:00 p.m. and unlocked at 6:00 a.m. weekdays with the exception of the Wilson Center, which is open 24 hours during the academic year. Academic buildings are closed on Saturday and Sunday except during scheduled activities. Students who need access to non-residential buildings after hours must present to Campus Security written permission from an authorized faculty or staff person. Campus Security will not permit less than two people at a time inside a building after hours and on weekends. Please note that the front gates of the campus are closed at 5:30 p.m. each night and remain closed during College breaks. Please do not leave vehicles parked inside the front gates after 5:30 p.m. Criminal Activity Off-campus Huntingdon College enjoys and strives to maintain constructive, harmonious relationships with the residents of Montgomery and neighboring communities. Students must respect the rights and property of those who live and work in these communities. Students who violate this principle and\/or whose behavior jeopardizes the College\u2019s positive relationship with local communities may, if applicable, be subject to criminal\/civil prosecution. The College will also take disciplinary action separately from any civil or criminal proceedings and will not be subject to challenge on the grounds that criminal charges involving the same off-campus incident are in litigation or have been dismissed. Campus Crime Report Form In compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, Huntingdon keeps and reports information about crimes on or near campus. If you have witnessed, been a victim of, or heard about a crime that occurred on or near campus, please use the Campus Crime Report Form to report what you know. Your identity may remain anonymous.
