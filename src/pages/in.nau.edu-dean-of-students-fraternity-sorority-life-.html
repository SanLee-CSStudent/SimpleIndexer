Recruitment Information University \u201CRecognized\u201D vs. \u201CUnrecognized\u201D Fraternities and Sororities Accordion Closed It is important for students and families to understand the differences between University \u201CRecognized\u201D and \u201CUnrecognized\u201D fraternities and sororities: A \u201CRecognized\u201D fraternity or sorority is one that is in good standing with the university. University-recognized fraternities and sororities are also recognized by one of the three Greek governing councils \u2013 the College Panhellenic Council, Interfraternity Council, or the United Greek Council. Recognized fraternities and sororities receive many privileges from the university including the ability to apply for funding, host\/sponsor events on campus, utilize University facilities, and many others found here. An \u201CUnrecognized\u201D fraternity or sorority is not associated with the university. The organizations and their members do not receive any support or advisement from the university. Unrecognized fraternities and sororities may not participate in any university-sponsored activity and may not utilize any property owned, operated, leased or managed by Northern Arizona University. In some cases, the university may have severed its relationship with these organizations due to significant and serious concerns over the health and safety of our students and university community or the organization did not follow the proper procedure to become a recognized organization on campus but chooses to continue to operate as an organization without the recognition of the university. In either case, the university would strongly discourage maintaining or seeking membership in these organizations. The following fraternities and sororities are unrecognized by Northern Arizona University: Tau Kappa Epsilon (may be operating as \u201CThe Club\u201D) For a list of our recognized fraternities and sororities please visit our List of Chapters Highlights 10,601 hours of community service during the 2021-2022 academic year. $358,158.50 raised for various local and national philanthropies during the 2020-2021 academic year.
