A number of scholarships and federal and state grants are available to prospective or continuing students who have shown academic proficiency and have demonstrated a financial need. Part-time employment opportunities also are available to students but are dependent upon the availability of jobs, available funds, and student\u2019s skills. PCCUA offers a variety of scholarships and grants. Complete your applications early! To Apply for Federal Financial Aid Create a new Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID.

No one is authorized to create a FSA ID on behalf of someone else, including a family member. Misrepresentation of identity to the Federal government could result in criminal or civil penalties. The FSA ID serves as an electronic signature and provides access to personal records, so never give a personal FSA ID to anyone. Be sure to keep the FSA ID in a safe place, as it will be needed to access federal Student Aid records online to view or make changes to records.

CRRSA Application Form Federal Pell Grant This is the basic grant available to undergraduate students who have demonstrated an exceptional financial need on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and have not earned a bachelor\u2019s or professional degree. The Department of Education determines a student\u2019s eligibility based on a students\u2019 answers to the FAFSA. Students must also meet other eligibility requirements to remain eligible for this award. The maximum award for the 2021-2022 academic year is $6,495, if students are enrolled full-time. The award amount is reduced for students enrolled less than full-time. A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid except under certain circumstance. Students must remember to complete and submit a FAFSA application every year as soon as possible, beginning October 1. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) FSEOG funds are limited and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis and are awarded with preference given to Pell Grant recipients who demonstrate exceptional need. Students must be enrolled at least half-time (six credit hours) to be eligible to receive FSEOG funds. Federal Work-Study Program (FWS) The Federal Work-Study program provides jobs for undergraduate students and enables them to earn money toward their college expenses by working on- or off-campus. Students are paid bi-weekly based on the federal or state minimum wage, whichever is more. Eligible students must have a financial need as determined by their FAFSA results. A separate FWS request must be completed and submitted to the institution\u2019s Work-Study Coordinator. Satisfactory Performance Standards for Financial Aid Eligibility Federal regulations governing all Title IV federal and campus-based programs (Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, and Federal Work-Study) require the institution to measure a student\u2019s progress toward a degree or certificate program. Students must complete requirements for a degree or certificate program within a reasonable length of time (150 percent\/three years) and maintain a minimum cumulative 2.0 grade point average. Total Credit Hours PCCUA students may attempt up to a maximum of 100 credit hours while pursuing their two-year degree. All courses attempted at PCCUA, including repeated and incomplete courses, courses with a grade of \"F\", \"W\", \"EW\" and \"I\", and all hours pursued at any other college, will be counted in the determination of hours attempted. Students required to enroll for remedial course work will be allowed to attempt up to 30 hours of remedial work, which will be counted toward the maximum 100 credit hour limit. Students must successfully complete at least 67 percent of all credit hours attempted each semester, including remedial courses, with a grade of \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", or \"D\". An evaluation will be made each semester to determine an individual student\u2019s progress. Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) Students, including those enrolled for remedial coursework, must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 to be in good standing. Evaluations will be made at the end of each semester to determine the student\u2019s progress for meeting cumulative GPA requirements. Probation Any student whose cumulative completion rate and\/or cumulative GPA falls below the minimum requirements will be placed on financial aid probation\/warning for one semester. During the probationary semester, students will be required to enroll in classes recommended by their advisor and may be required to report for tutoring. Students on financial aid probation must meet the requirements at the end of the probationary semester or their financial aid will be terminated. Termination of Aid Student whose financial aid has been terminated for failure to meet satisfactory academic progress standards (SAP), may make an appeal in writing to the Financial Aid Exceptions Committee. The student should explain any mitigating circumstances related to the individual\u2019s academic problem and be prepared to provide supporting documentation.
