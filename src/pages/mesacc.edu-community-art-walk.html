The Welders Richard H. Dyer, Jr. 2010 BP 43A - West Welded - Steel sculpture The sculpture was created by MCC welding student and Mesa Independent Managing Editor Richard Dyer, who donated it to the college. Soleri Bells Paolo Soleri 1968 LB 11 - Lobby The Soleri Bells were created by Paolo Soleri. This original bell sculpture is anchored on a one-of-a-kind cast aluminum spine and is a rich part of MCC's history as a gift from the class of 1968. The cast bronze bells were refurbished and reinstalled in January 2010. The absence of the artist's inscription indicates that the piece was made before Soleri began signing his art. Linkage Barbara Gryutis 1999 LB 11 - Lobby A series of interlocking ribbons intersecting at a column create imagery connecting the pathways of the college campus. Linkage was designed by Barbara Gryutis in 1999. The artist integrates art with architecture, incorporating the imagery of interlocking ribbons throughout the sidewalks and walkways leading to the Paul A. Elsner Library, to express the relationship between the college, its environment and the community. Big OU Hiroki Tanaka 1987 LB 11 - South According to the artist, this kinetic sculpture challenges viewers perception of science and reality because the cables are stressed to their limits to support the geometric forms. Together the \"O\" and the \"U\" represent stillness and calmness of the yin and yang forces. A view from the library's third floor Southwest Reading Room provides an amazing view of the sculpture as well as MCC's campus and clocktower. Donated by Tempe Art Center, 2000. Tree of Life James Schwarz\/Barry Unitas Barnes 2017 LS 12 - South MCC alumnus James Schwarz captures the beauty of science. The hanging triangles of the sculpture represent the categorization of biological organisms, which can be traced to larger bodies of organisms. The more organisms found in a group, the larger the tile. Numbers on the tiles also represent their placement within the classification. Artist Barry Unitas Barnes created the support sculpture. Dance of the Chromosomes Reece Grissom 2018 LS 12 - 2nd floor In these three life drawings, the artist, Reece Grissom, uses human figures to represent the chromosomes during mitosis. A cell\u2019s life cycle consists of two major stages: Interphase and Mitosis. In Interphase, where the genetic material exists as a very thin network throughout the nucleus, called chromatin. During this stage, the DNA is replicated. In mitosis, the \u201Cmother\u201D cell produces two \u201Cdaughter\u201D cells that contain the same genetic information and number of chromosomes as the original \u201Cmother\u201D cell. In humans, there are 46 chromosomes in each cell but the number varies, dependent on the species. Mitosis results in growth, development and repair. Artist Reece Grissom taught biology at GateWay Community College for 29 years and retired in 2013. The idea for this series of drawings came from a description of mitosis, often used in textbooks, calling it \u201CThe Dance of the Chromosomes.\u201D Grissom has taken dance classes at MCC for more than 35 years and used her experience in dance to help her visualize the biological process with the movements and poses of dancers bodies. Single Hex Star 2004 MC 5 - East Metal wind sculpture. Single Helix 2004 MC 5 - East Metal wind sculpture. Double Helix Horizontal 2004 MC 5 - East Metal wind sculpture. AllisOneenOsillA Geoff Coppola, Madeleine Chowdhury, Robert Holmes 2017 MC 5 - West MCC alumnus Geoff Coppola's AllisOneenOsillA, a palindrome for All is One, One is All, was created in collaboration with MCC mathematics faculty Madeleine Chowdhury. The live-edge steel frame was crafted by MCC welding faculty Robert Holmes with assistance by Merri Stafford, a former welding student. Geometrically, it represents a dodecagonal quasicrystal similar to four other murals at MCC. Composed of 2,600 ceramic blocks, the piece weighs 1.1 ton. All is One, One is All infers the dynamic interconnection and co-evolution of a community, both holistically and individually. It symbolizes the unity and dedication of students and educators to innovation and creativity in science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM). \"Tawhid\" (Making One) Linda M. Speranza and Madeleine Chowdhury 2008 MC 5 - North A clay mural on cement backing incorporating both the art and math disciplines. \"Ummah\" (Community) Linda M.

The Future Is Indigenous 2021 Alyssa \"Aly\" Masaquaptewa 36N - American Indian Institute This mural combines many elements of the Arizona landscape, as well as an homage to the diversity among Native people, all coming together under the MCC Thunderbird mascots. The mascots are separated by an image of the traditional I\u2019itoi (pronounced EE-toy), also known as the Man In The Maze, a prominent motif within the culture of the O\u2019odham people of Arizona, which symbolizes ones journey through life, experiences along the way, and an eventual ending. The artist's talent with the paintbrush was heavily influenced by her family of Hopi artists, none more important to her than her grandfather, the renowned Anthony Honahnie from Tuba City, AZ. Her work is focused on bringing together both traditional and urban Native American lifestyles. Stained Glass Thunderbird - 1978 1978 36N - North Originally constructed for $8,200, the T-bird was designed as a landmark for a then fledgling community college campus. Now standing in the eastern shadow of another campus icon\u2014the clock tower\u2014the MCC Thunderbird greets those coming and going from the athletic fields to the student center along the main east\/west pedestrian walk that runs across most of the campus. Generations Mural 2016 ST28 - West This student-designed 60\u2019 x 20\u2019 mural on the west side of Studio 28 incorporates many themes highlighting the heritage of the Southwest. Women\u2019s rights, the cultural gap between generations, urbanization, water rights and the concept of past, present and future are all interwoven into the design, which seeks to bring awareness to the good and bad consequences of expansion. The project involved months of student research, design and execution and included a Community Paint Day, which drew over 70 participants from MCC and the community. Completed in Spring 2016 under the direction of artist Hugo Medina. This collaborative project was overseen by a cross-disciplinary team and made possible through a 2015-16 Maricopa Center for Learning and Instruction grant and MCC contributions. Elevated Desert Laurie Lundquist 1992 TH 29 - North Elevated Desert was designed by Laurie Lundquist, whose concept was to raise the desert floor up to eye-level. The artwork provides passersby shade and a place to rest. The tree that grows through the center of the structure was not part of the original design, but during construction she decided to keep it. This exhibit is part of MCC's Art in Public Places program with a purpose to add environmental art to the campus that would be both functional and visually appealing. Sentinels to the East Joan Waters 2004 Art Gallery - East A watchtower that watches over the campus with a leafy top that suggests growth.
