The search committee was large and included alumni, all tasked with finding both a music faculty member and a choir director. At the time of the search in 1992 and 1993, Seigel was an adjunct professor at the College and was already leading the choir \u2013 adding a curveball for the hiring committee in how he would proceed in the interview process, which included observed direction of the choir, without any advantages. While other candidates led the choir with the music Seigel taught them, Seigel led them in music they had learned with the legendary Dr. J. Hugh Thomas \u201933 earlier that year. Seigel got the position and has led the choir ever since \u2013 the Concert Choir and Hilltop Singers being two of the most important parts of his job. The impact of world-class musician and beloved professor Hugh Thomas did not end with Seigel\u2019s interviews either: Seigel was later named the inaugural Hugh Thomas Professor of Music in honor of the longtime faculty member and Seigel\u2019s own former music teacher. \u201CHe was fiercely musical and fiercely dedicated to teaching,\u201D Seigel says about Thomas. \u201CHe lived and breathed music. He was a composer, he was a mentor, and an inspiration to students, just by being himself.\u201D For more than 30 years, Seigel has taught music courses to majors and non-majors, conducted the College\u2019s choirs and operas, and led music competitions and other performances on the Hilltop. Though he did not expect to end up teaching at his alma mater, Seigel says BSC has played an important role in his own story as a musician, including his high school lessons with Thomas. Seigel was first introduced to the Department of Music in high school when he drove to campus every other Friday for two-hour piano lessons. He graduated high school and attended Oberlin College in Ohio before he \u201Ctransferred to \u2019Southern for a girl,\u201D Seigel\u2019s now wife of more than 40 years Jane Sisson Seigel \u201979. Seigel earned his master\u2019s degree and Doctor of Musical Arts in orchestral conducting and literature from the University of Colorado \u2013 Boulder and returned to Birmingham to serve as Temple Emanu-El\u2019s music director and organist, a position he held for nine years before becoming a full-time faculty member at BSC. Like Thomas \u2013 who founded the Alumni Choir and Hilltop Singers \u2013 Seigel has led the choir through challenging and inspiring music and continued its many traditions during his time in the department. Choir and his courses \u2013 like the introductory music course he teaches every year \u2013 also allow him to introduce all BSC students outside of his department to music and its importance. \u201CI never like to conceive music in a vacuum \u2013 the liberal arts connection and how music fits in is vital,\u201D he says. \u201CAll of the great performers that I respect believe that. If you are insensitive to the world and music\u2019s ability to reflect the world, you\u2019re missing out. It\u2019s the interior game that matters, and that\u2019s what moves people. That\u2019s why music endures.\u201D Seigel enjoys collaborating with different departments through performances and other events, most often with the Department of Theatre, and he is always impressed by the productions they create with the talent from their students. He thinks back to collaborating with Professor Emeritus Michael Flowers and the late Professor Emerita Mildred Allen during \u201Cthe years we lost our minds\u201D between 1999 and 2003 and staging several difficult productions between musical theatre and opera, including \u201CSweeney Todd\u201D and \u201CLa bo?hme\u201D in the same year and \u201CPassion\u201D and \u201CCompany\u201D in the surrounding years. Seigel thinks back to Thomas often and his years at the College, and he knows Thomas would admire the growth and changes made throughout the department. He is enhancing Thomas\u2019s legacy directly through the honored professorship and leading role in the choirs and represents the best ways music adds to a Birmingham-Southern education. \u201CI\u2019d like to think that Hugh motivates the best of what I do,\u201D Seigel says. \u201CIf you major in what you\u2019re passionate about at a place like Birmingham-Southern, you will get the best undergraduate education.\u201D This story was included in a special fine and performing edition of From the Hilltop, Birmingham-Southern\u2019s alumni email newsletter.
