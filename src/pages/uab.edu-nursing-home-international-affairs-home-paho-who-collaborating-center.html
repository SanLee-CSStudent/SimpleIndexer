A PAHO\/WHO Collaborating Center (WHOCC) is an official designation given by the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizing the School's sustained involvement and interest in developing the global nursing workforce. The UAB School of Nursing first received this designation in 1994. We are in the Region of the Americas, so we partner closely with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and are active members of both the Pan American Network of Nursing & Midwifery Collaborating Centers (PANMCC) and the Global Network of Nursing & Midwifery Collaborating Centers (GNWHOCC). WHAT DOES IT MEAN? The WHO designation indicates that the academic, research and clinical programs in UAB's School of Nursing are recognized nationally and internationally, and that UAB has superior scientific and technical leadership in nursing education. This is of value to the World Health Organization with whom we collaborate on various projects with impact for nursing education in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our Terms of Reference (2019-2023) In March 2019, the UAB School of Nursing received redesignation as a PAHO\/WHO Collaborating Center on International Nursing for another four year period (2019-2023). As a WHOCC, we must fulfill \"Terms of Reference\" with agreed-upon Activities that support PAHO\/WHO in their efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC): Support PAHO\/WHO's efforts to strengthen the quality of nursing education and practice based on Universal Access to Health, Universal Health Coverage and Primary Health Care.
