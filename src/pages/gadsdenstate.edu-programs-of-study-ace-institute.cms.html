Who are eligible students? Students must be sophomores, juniors or seniors. What GPA is required for ACE Institute\/Dual Enrollment? Students must have a minimum cumulative (unweighted) grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale for approved programs only. What courses are offered for Dual Enrollment credit? An extensive list of academic and career technical courses are offered for dual enrollment students. Students should speak with an Enrollment Specialist for the entire course list, including career technical courses. \"Special Topics\" courses are not eligible for ACE Institute scholarship funding. Developmental courses may not be taken by dual students. How does a Dual Enrollment class meet high school requirements? Typically, students must complete three semester credit hours at the postsecondary level to equal one credit (Carnegie unit) at the high school level in the same or related subject. Each course must be crosswalked by the Local Education Agency (LEA) before high school equivalency credit can be determined for named academic courses. Each LEA must crosswalk the secondary course of study and the post-secondary syllabus. High school crosswalks are not required for courses counting as elective credit (career technical courses, fine art courses, etc.) What are the costs associated with Dual Enrollment courses? Students are responsible for the cost of tuition, fees, textbooks and materials\/supplies as required in the syllabus of each course unless covered by alternative funding sources, such as the ACE scholarship. Some dual enrollment students may qualify to participate in the tuition repayment plan. Students not enrolled in the tuition repayment plan, who fail to pay tuition and fees by the end of the drop\/add period are not considered enrolled and may be dropped from course rolls. View the current tuition rate here: Tuition, Fees and Refunds Is financial aid available for Dual Enrollment courses? Dual enrollment students are not eligible for federal student aid (such as Pell grants). Students wishing to enroll in certain high wage, high demand Career and Technical Education programs may be eligible for a dual enrollment scholarship through Gadsden State's ACE Institute. Students awarded the ACE scholarship may be awarded tuition and fees. ACE scholarship funds may also be used to cover costs of general education courses (math, science or English) in the eligible CTE program of study if the courses are taken concurrently with CTE course(s). Scholarship applications will be available March 1 annually, with an application deadline of May 1 annually. Applications still will be accepted after the priority deadline and will be awarded based on scholarship availability. Do high school students have to travel to the college to take Dual Enrollment classes? If a high school teacher meets the credentialing requirements of the college and is employed as an adjunct instructor by the college, the course may be taught by the high school teacher at the high school. With permission from parents and school administrators, students may travel on their own to college campuses to take classes. Students may also take dual enrollment courses online, however it is suggested that students taking an online course be recommended by their high school counselor, due to the discipline required. Dual enrollment students are encouraged to take summer classes to shorten their time toward a degree. As a current dual enrollment student, how can I request my Gadsden State transcript be sent to another college? Dual enrollment credit is contingent upon high school graduation. Official college credit for dual enrollment courses will not be finalized on the student's Gadsden State transcript until proof of high school graduation is submitted to Gadsden State. Request that your high school send Gadsden State your graduated transcript as soon as it is available after graduation. Once Gadsden State receives your graduated high school transcript, you may request that we send your Gadsden State transcript to the college of your choice.
