Throughout your time in SOPH you are encouraged to meet with your academic advisor at least once every semester to ensure that you are on track to graduate as planned.

I've worked in several different areas but have spent the majority of my time in the School of Public Health. I am a two-time UAB graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology with a concentration in social psychology and a minor in communication management and a master\u2019s degree in clinical mental health counseling. I am a National Board Certified Counselor. What I love most about being an academic advisor is getting to know my students and watching them grow and change as I help them navigate UAB and progress towards their degree and ultimately their career. When I am not on campus you can most likely find me on a trail in the woods in my Jeep. I enjoy exploring new places, and just finding joy in the journey, no matter where it takes me.\u202F Nicole Gravitt This email address is being protected from spambots.

(205) 975-9272 I first came to UAB in 2006 as a faculty member in the Department of Sociology. After a few years I realized that I wanted to work more directly with communities experiencing health disparities, so I went to work for the Department of Veterans Affairs on studies addressing Veteran homelessness. During that time I also earned my MPH degree online, and was excited to return to UAB to teach in the new undergraduate public health program in 2015. As Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, part of my job is to make sure that our undergraduate program prepares students for employment or additional schooling after graduation. I also advise students who are considering graduate school \u2014 as someone who applied to graduate school multiple times in various fields AND has served on Graduate Admissions Committees for years, I know all the tricks for finding and getting accepted to the perfect program!
