Communication Method: WebinarMessage Types: Town halls Quarterly updates Educational lectures Learn More: Zoom Webinar Listservs Audience: Manually Updated List of Faculty\/Staff\/External Recipients Listservs are used for a defined, static audience of information recipients and are necessary for lists that include recipients outside of UAB. The audience can be determined through self-subscription, or a list owner can add and remove recipients. Listservs may be set up as a one-way distribution outlet or as a virtual discussion community to which all members can post information. To request a Listserv, contact the AskIT Help Desk at 996-5555. Once the ticket is generated, you will need to attach an email from your supervisor stating approval. Allow seven business days for the request to be processed.

Each use of these services constructs its list of recipients in real-time. To request a distribution list, contact the AskIT Help Desk at 996-5555. Time required to setup a dynamic list will vary based on the selection criteria; typically seven days should be sufficient.
