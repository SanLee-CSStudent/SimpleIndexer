The industry is increasingly characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity. Combining a business degree with a medical degree can help future healthcare leaders learn to manage through rapid change and traverse the uncertainties of management with flexibility. Students who choose the MD\/MBA option often plan careers with both clinical and administrative responsibilities. MD\/MBA holders can operate their clinics more efficiently, manage a healthcare organization, head a research project, or advocate for their patients and work to improve the healthcare system. Students successfully completing the program will understand how to use innovation and strategic thinking to solve healthcare problems. They will become fluent in the languages of medicine and business, putting them on the fast track to career advancement. Why UAB's MBA Program?
