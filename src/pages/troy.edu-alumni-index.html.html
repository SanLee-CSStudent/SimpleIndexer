The TROY Alumni Affairs Office is conducting an alumni survey to learn how the University can better serve the needs of Trojans, both before and after graduation. Your response to this survey will help TROY plan for future alumni classes and to stay in contact with you. TROY Alumni Survey Dear Alumni, Donors and Friends, The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting our lives in ways we could never have imagined only a few days ago. For example, more than a million U.S. workers are expected to lose their jobs by the end of March. Almost 300,000 workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, a 33 percent increase over the previous week, so the situation is dire indeed. Our hearts go out to the friends and families of those impacted. Please allow me to share ways we can help our Trojan family during this extraordinary time. Supporting small businesses with a TROY connection. Please shop locally and help our TROY family businesses continue to serve our communities. Support our students, faculty and staff. Many Trojans will need emergency assistance and we will establish a fund to help them. In fact, we still have students on campus who need assistance to get home. With student debt at an all-time high, many of our students can still benefit from scholarships. And just a few days ago, I heard from a Trojan who is facing homelessness due to a family financial crisis. If you are able to support the critical needs of our students, faculty or staff, please make your checks payable to the TROY University Foundation for the COVID-19 Annual Fund and mail to: 301 Adams Admin., Troy, AL 36082. If you\u2019d like to make a donation online, please do so by going to donate.troy.edu\/Troy_Annual_Giving and designating to the Troy Annual Fund with the notation COVID-19. During this challenging time, I hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. I want you to know we are thankful for your unwavering support and generosity. I am confident we will emerge from this crisis a stronger, more unified, Troy University.
