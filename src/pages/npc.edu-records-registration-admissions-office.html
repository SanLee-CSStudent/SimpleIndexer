The same cumulative GPA standards outlined above apply. Each year, NPC selects five students, one from each degree area (AA, ABus, AS, AGS, AAS) to honor as Outstanding Graduates. These students are selected based on the highest cumulative GPA from students who attended classes that are open to the general student population eligible to receive a specific degree. In the case of a tie in GPA\u2019s, the student with the most credits earned at NPC is awarded the recognition. Students who utilize any transfer credits from other colleges to meet the degree requirements at NPC are not eligible for this recognition. Students must have all degree requirements either completed or in progress to be eligible for Outstanding Graduate consideration. Students must not have any documented current or prior disciplinary infractions. Northland Pioneer College uses the following grading system: Grade Points Explanation A 4.0 Excellent B 3.0 Good C 2.0 Average D 1.0 Below Average F 0 Failing I 0 Incomplete. Not computed in GPA. Course work must be completed in allotted time or grade of F assigned. P 0 Pass. Credit awarded, but is not computed in GPA. W 0 Withdrawal. No credit awarded, not computed in GPA. AU 0 Audit. No credit or grade awarded, not computed in GPA AS 0 Assessed Credit. Not computed in NPC Grade-Point Average IP 0 In Progress. Appears on transcript when currently enrolled in a class and stays until a final class grade has been given for semester. NPC does not use plus or minus grades. A student with a grade of less than \u2018C\u2019 in any subject should not expect to continue advanced work in that field unless there is other evidence indicating possible success. See Instructions on how to calculate your grade-point average. National Exams Transcript Notations Carry 0 points, not computed in GPA AP Advanced Placement Exam CI Cambridge International Exam CL CLEP \u2013 College Level Exam Program DS DSST \u2013 DANTES Subject Standardized Tests IB International Baccalaureate Incomplete (\u2018I\u2019) Grades An incomplete grade may be given to support student success when extenuating circumstance exists (but not to delay a final grade when a student is performing poorly). To award an incomplete grade of I,' the student must be passing the course with at least a C' or otherwise demonstrating satisfactory performance as determined by the instructor. A student receiving an incomplete grade has the responsibility of completing all work as outlined in an Incomplete Grade Agreement for removal of the incomplete grade. Once all work is completed and graded, the instructor will submit a Change of Grade form with a copy of the Incomplete Grade Agreement. If an incomplete is not removed within one semester (Fall or Spring) from the end of the semester in which it was awarded, it is automatically converted to a grade of 'F.' Withdrawal (\u2018W\u2019) Grades A student or an instructor can initiate a grade of \u2018W.\u2019 The grade of \u2018W\u2019 will appear on the student\u2019s transcript for each class withdrawn from AFTER the end of the second week of the semester. Withdrawal from classes during the first two weeks of the semester (for semester-length classes) will not be reflected on the student\u2019s transcript. All nonsemester-length classes (usually identified as short-term classes) will show a \u2018W\u2019 regardless of when the withdrawal occurs after the class begins. Any student wishing to withdraw from ALL their classes on or after the first day of class must speak with an academic adviser in order to complete the process. Audit (\u2018AU\u2019) Grades A student may choose to enroll in a course for an Audit grade which allows a student to fully participate in all aspects of the course, without graded assignments, without affecting the student\u2019s grade-point average. The Audit grade does not count for credit and does not count as successful completion of the course for prerequisite purposes nor for any degree or certificate program requirements. Students may not switch from a letter grade (including \u2018P\u2019) to an Audit grade for a course once they have registered for a letter grade. Students registering for an Audit grade may not file for a change of grade to a letter grade at the end of the course. When a student registers for an Audit, Records and Registration assigns the final grade as \u2018AU.\u2019 Courses taken for an Audit grade do not appear on official transcripts. Students are cautioned that courses taken for an Audit grade will not be accepted for transfer at other postsecondary institutions. Students taking courses for Audit grades pay regular tuition and fees for audited courses. The Audit grade option is not available for one-day workshops, dual or concurrent enrollment or College and Career Preparation (CCP) courses and all course offered through Community Services (typically courses with a 099x designation). To register for an Audit grade for a course, a student must take the following steps: Beginning with the first day of the semester or summer session, obtain a course Registration Form and an Audit Request Form from an NPC Academic Adviser who can also determine whether there is available space in the course. The student signs the Audit Request Form indicating that the student understands the limitations of auditing a course. The student then checks with the instructor to see if the instructor will allow the student into the course as an auditing student. If so, the instructor signs the Registration Form and the Audit Request Form. Take both forms to the campus\/center front office at any NPC location to complete the registration process. They will check to see if the course still has open seats available and, if so, register the student for the course. The student will be given a copy of the Registration and Audit Request forms and copies will also be sent to the Records & Registration - Admissions Office. Pass (\u2018P\u2019) Grades If a student wants to take the \u2018P\u2019 grade option in a class where the option is available, the student must make a written request to the instructor to take the course on the \u201Cpass\/fail\u201D basis prior to the second class meeting of the semester. If the instructor agrees to the request, they will sign and date the written request and forward to the Records & Registration - Admissions Office. Once the request is made, it may not later be rescinded. Students should consider the following point when deciding to take a class for a 'P' grade: A \u2018P\u2019 grade is NOT available in any courses designated as general education courses. A \u2018P\u2019 grade MAY not be accepted for transfer credit to postsecondary institutions, nor does NPC accept \u2018P\u2019 grades from other institutions for credit at NPC. No \u2018P\u2019 credits are allowed for the following degrees: AA, AAEC, AAEE, ABUS or AS. For AGS or AAS degrees, the maximum number of \u2018P\u2019 credits allowed by NPC is 12. Because \u2018P\u2019 grades will satisfy course prerequisites as a \u201C\u2018C\u2019 or better,\u201D the minimum requirements for a \u2018P\u2019 grade are those regularly required for a \u2018C\u2019 grade in any class in which the \u2018P\u2019 grade option is allowed. A \u2018P\u2019 grade cannot be later changed to a letter grade, nor can a letter grade be later changed to a \u2018P\u2019 grade. Grading Procedures The instructor is responsible for assigning grades. Grades are based on academic performance, class participation and attendance. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. An instructor may lower a grade based on academic dishonesty or other forms of student misconduct. Academic dishonesty or other forms of student misconduct may also be referred to the Vice President for Learning for further action. Instructors post final grades after each semester. Students may view their grades by logging into the MyNPC website. NPC does NOT mail grades to students unless a special request is made to the Records & Registration office. Grade changes can be made ONLY by the instructor with approval of the dean and\/or the Vice President for Learning. Changes must be submitted within one semester from the end of the semester in which the grade was awarded. After that time, the student must follow the Appeal of Grade process. Students who disagree with a grade may file a grade appeal as outlined in the Students Rights & Responsibilities section of the college catalog. Students must contact their instructor FIRST to start the appeal process. The Records & Registration office cannot change student grades. A student may repeat a course to raise a grade. The higher grade will be credited and counted in computing the student\u2019s grade-point average. The lower grade will not be used, but will still appear on any transcript. Students receiving financial aid are limited on the number of times a class may be repeated for funding purposes. Credit courses at NPC may only be counted once toward fulfilling the credit requirements for any degree or certificate, except in the case of music performance, art studio or HPE courses, which can be repeated up to four times for graduation credit. A student may repeat, without limit, any course offered by NPC to meet the mission and institutional goals adopted by the District Governing Board and listed in the current college catalog. President's & Dean's List Honors The President\u2019s List recognizes students who achieved a perfect 4.0 grade-point average during a specific semester. The Dean\u2019s List honors those with a 3.5 to 3.99 grade-point average during a specific semester. To be eligible for these distinctions, students must have completed 12 or more credits in 100-level or above courses. Students will receive letters of recognition and the honor will be noted on their transcripts.
