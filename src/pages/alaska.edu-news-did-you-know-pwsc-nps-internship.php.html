Did you know that Prince William Sound College (PWSC) and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve partner to offer an internship program that helps students and the community? Did you know that Prince William Sound College (PWSC) and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve partner to offer an internship program that helps students and the community? Every summer, a PWSC Outdoor Leadership student has the opportunity to work closely with park staff to learn about park planning, interpretation of law and policy, and basic land management principles. Joe Kay, a graduate of Prince William Sound College, was an intern in the program in the summer of 2020. \u201CWe went out towards Slana in the North District of the park and conducted a condition assessment of an Off-Road Vehicle (ORV) trail,\u201D Kay said. \u201CWe were using a handheld Trimble GPS unit to collect condition data along the trail.\u201D Kay now has a job as a lead guide with Alaska Guide Company, where he uses skills he developed as an intern including what it takes to maintain trails and appreciate the environment. PWSC and the National Park Service (NPS) also work together throughout the year on local community initiatives with the college\u2019s Copper Basin Extension Center. This collaboration includes other local area governmental organizations, non-profits, and tribal organizations, and provides opportunities for youth and community members. \u201CWe all care about this amazing place we call home,\u201D said Carrie Wittmer, the team lead for the Division of Interpretation & Education at Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. \u201CIt takes work to keep this place beautiful, wild, and thriving. No one organization has the staff, money, or time to do everything that needs to be done. The way we get things done is by sharing ideas, working together, and leveraging the resources we can contribute.\u201D (Joe Kay, a graduate of Prince William Sound College, helps trail maintenance staff during his internship with the Wrangell St. Elias National Park and Preserve in 2020.
