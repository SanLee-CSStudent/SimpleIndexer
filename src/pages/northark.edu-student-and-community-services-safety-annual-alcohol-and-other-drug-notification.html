Sanctions North Arkansas College: The above prohibition applies equally to students, employees, and visitors to the college. Such reviews will consider the severity of the individual\u2019s action(s), academic\/employment record and previous offences, if any. Northark reserves the right to place students\/employees on probation for a period of time determined appropriate by the institution. Subsequent offences could result in suspension from school\/employment or termination of school attendance or employment. Initial sanctions are not restricted to probation and Northark reserves the right to suspend individuals on the first offense if the circumstances indicate such a sanction is appropriate. Northark also reserves the right to require an individual to complete a rehabilitation program before reinstating that individual in school or for employment. Local, State and Federal: Students and employees understand that sanctions are not restricted to those imposed by North Arkansas College. Individuals are subject to the penalties imposed by local, state, and federal law. The penalties for possession of and\/or trafficking in illicit drugs vary, depending upon the substance(s) involved and quantity, and previous offences, if any. Fines can range from the thousands of dollars into the millions, while imprisonment can be for as long as life. Health Risks of Drug and Alcohol Use Illicit drugs as well as alcohol and other drugs have various effects on the body and mind. The initial, short-term effects may be positive feelings like alertness, optimism, self-confidence, energy, or stress relief. However, the secondary, long-term, negative effects far exceed the initial positive effects. The use of alcohol impairs reasoning and clouds judgment. Long term drinking can lead to alcoholism and liver and heart disease. A person who begins drinking early in life is more likely to become a heavy drinker during adolescence and to experience alcohol abuse or dependence in adulthood. Effects of drug and alcohol use on the body: mood swings\/impaired judgment depression\/mania sleep disturbances and irritability increase in aggressive or combative behavior heart and\/or breathing difficulties\/death increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections liver damage Signs that indicate a person is becoming dependent on a substance: Increased tolerance. It takes more and more to get the desired effect. This increases the risk of overdose. Changes in relationships with friends and family. Withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, shakiness, headaches, convulsions, or hallucinations. Psychological dependence \u2013 thinking that using a substance will help him or her get through the day.
