The Global Final, originally scheduled for December 2021, was postponed until March 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Learn more about their tool below. Two Arizona State University students will represent the United States in Turkey in the Red Bull Basement Global Final on Dec. 13\u201315. Brinlee Kidd and Sylvia Lopez were selected from 182 applications across the country to pitch their automated note-taking tool, Jotted. The Red Bull Basement program was created to empower student innovators in all areas of study to kick-start their ideas using technology to drive positive change. \u201COur goal with Jotted is to empower students and prepare them for the academic challenges they will inevitably face,\u201D Lopez says. Like other popular note-taking apps, Jotted lets students type notes and organize them into digital notebooks. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. The software automatically creates flash cards from the notes for future studying. It also includes a resource-finding feature. For example, if a student is confused during a lecture and the professor moves on too quickly, the student can mark that portion of the notes. Jotted will conduct a search and suggest additional resources to increase understanding. Before an exam, Jotted will even create practice tests based on the lecture notes. The idea for Jotted grew out of personal experience. \u201CIt kind of came to a head when I had a test in my computer information systems class,\u201D says Kidd, a first-year student majoring in informatics with a minor in film and media production. \u201CIt took me 11 hours to study for this test. But by the time the test came, I realized that I spent more time just trying to find information than actually learning it.\u201D Kidd brought up the topic with her roommate, Lopez, a first-year student studying industrial engineering with a minor in human systems engineering. Their dorm-room discussions evolved into the idea for Jotted. While the tool can help with late-night cram sessions like Kidd\u2019s, she and Lopez hope it will also reduce the need for them, as well as \u201Ctake the intimidation factor out of exams.\u201D \u201CWe think it could really help people learn better study habits. I mean, as you\u2019re taking notes, giving you the option to create flash cards \u2014 that\u2019s going to get you thinking about the test that\u2019s coming up. Now you\u2019ve just finished a lecture and you already have study resources. You already have a practice test. You already have all these resources, and the test is two weeks away,\u201D says Kidd.

Earlier this semester, they joined ASU\u2019s Luminosity Lab, a student-driven, interdisciplinary research and development lab. \u201CLuminosity is about reimagining the traditional university model of student engagement,\u201D says Mark Naufel, executive director of Luminosity Lab. \u201CWe train students of all academic backgrounds with a core set of 21st-century skills that allow them to lead the development of cutting-edge technologies. This is done irrespective of age \u2014 and Sylvia and Brinlee are proof that with the right skills and motivation, our students can perform at the highest levels of excellence and compete on the world stage.\u201D \u201CI\u2019d found an ad on Snapchat for Red Bull Basement,\u201D Kidd says. \u201CI brought it to Mark, saying maybe some of the older, more experienced lab members would be able to put something together to submit. And he just looked at us and said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do it?\u2019\u201D The Luminosity team supported Lopez and Kidd throughout the process of developing Jotted. \u201CWe had enough coding knowledge to build out the foundation for an idea like this and to know that it was achievable, but once we advanced in the stages, we had a lot of late-night sessions with the people in the lab. They were incredibly supportive and efficient in creating this team around us,\u201D Kidd says. She adds: \u201CIn the past month or so I\u2019ve learned so much about natural language processing, which is one of the main features in our app, and predictive analytics, things I never would have had the chance or connections to learn without the lab.\u201D As finalists, Lopez and Kidd receive additional resources and support through Red Bull Basement. Finalists are selected by a panel of judges who consider the feasibility, creativity and impact of the entries. Each finalist team \u2014 one from each participating country \u2014 receives access to a workspace, one-on-one sessions with international mentors and connection to a global network of innovators. \u201CWe have been set up with countless mentors from around the globe and within the U.S. Red Bull headquarters network. Already we\u2019ve been able to talk with some incredible people,\u201D Lopez says. Kidd adds, \u201CWe\u2019re grateful for this opportunity from Red Bull Basement. It\u2019s really incredible what they\u2019re doing, creating a global community of young innovators that truly just want to change the world and make it a better place.\u201D In December, Team Jotted will spend three days in Istanbul immersed in workshops, mentorship sessions and more, culminating in the final pitch and the announcement of the 2021 global winner from among the 44 national finalists. The winners will receive a custom package of resources to realize their unique idea. All of the finalists will forge business relationships and networking connections with some of the world\u2019s most visionary thought leaders. Lopez and Kidd offer some advice to other students with promising ideas who aren\u2019t sure if they can turn them into reality. \u201CThere\u2019s no shame in asking questions,\u201D Lopez says. \u201CIf you have an idea, ask around, see what your friends think. Ask about things you don\u2019t know or things you want to learn.\u201D \u201CI\u2019m also an Edson E+I FellowThe Edson E+I Fellows program is a cohort-based program for first-year students to explore the possibilities of entrepreneurship.

Orin Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute, and their catchphrase is \u2018just start,\u2019\u201D Kidd says. \u201CI think there\u2019s no better way to describe it. If you have an idea, ASU is such an innovative university. If you just take a little bit of time to research, you can find people who want to help you bring your idea to fruition.\u201D Lopez adds: \u201CWith Jotted, our goal is to empower students. We want to see anyone who even has an inkling of an idea give it a shot.\u201D Top photo: ASU students and roommates Sylvia Lopez (left) and Brinlee Kidd have been named the U.S. finalists in the Red Bull Basement Global Final for their innovative note-taking tool, Jotted.
