Specialist\/Sec. Ed Missouri State University, Springfield, Missouri North Arkansas College finished the 2020-21 season with a record of 12-12 losing by 1 in the Region 2 semifinals to SAU Tech who finished 6th in the NJCAA National Tourney. Returning no starters from the previous campaign, the young squad faced many hurdles navigating the COVID modifications that impacted everything from academic instruction to a delayed and shortened schedule. The Pioneer season started in late January and Northark won 9 of their first 12 contests. Playing 12 games in the month of March, the lack of depth and strong Region 2 competition took its toll and the result was a .500 season. Offensively, the Pioneers averaged 96ppg and were led by All-American Trent Lippoldt (6\u20197 sophomore) 19.7ppg & 11.1rbpg. Also contributing, were Elliott Brooks (6\u20193 sophomore) 14.3ppg 77-180 42.8% from 3(1st in NJCAA D2) and Dontae Taylor (6\u20190 freshmen) 9.5ppg 174 assists (7.3pg)1st in NJCAA D2! With an NJCAA eligibility waiver, the 2021-2022 Pioneers return Lippoldt, Brooks, and Taylor along with starters Cyrus Alexander (6\u20195 sophomore) 10 ppg and Chris Hill (6\u20193 freshmen) 12.1ppg. Transfers Tahj Patterson (6\u20191 freshmen), Jacob Hudson (6\u20193 freshmen),Yohana Del (6\u20196 freshmen), and Ricardo Sutton (6\u20191 freshmen) will bring additional size and quickness to the transition-minded Pioneers. Nine talented freshmen join Tanner Oetting (6\u20191 sophomore) and Uziel Muteba (6\u20192 freshmen), who both missed last season to injuries, to round out the Pioneer squad. On January 27, 2019, Coach Hunter was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. Coach Hunter and his assistant, Jordan Hunter, will look to improve on their 139-73 (.66%) record heading into their 8th season. The Pioneers will again utilize the services of former Pioneer, Mitch Closser, as a student assistant. Coach Hunter completed a highly successful coaching career at the high school level spanning Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. His overall record of 536-254 (.678 winning %) spans 28 years including a Missouri State Championship in 2003 and five other Final Four Appearances. Hunter was a 2009 Missouri Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame Inductee and Missouri Coach of the Year in 1996 and 2003. Steve and his wife Julie have been married for 40 years and have three adult children; Jordan (8th year North Arkansas Assistant), and wife Janissa; Spencer, and wife Laura Ashley; and daughter, Hayley.
