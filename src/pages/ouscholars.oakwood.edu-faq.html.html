Is it okay to scan the printed page to a PDF file? When I copy and paste abstracts into the Submit form, some formatted text reverts to plain text. What's going on? How do I include accents and special characters in the abstracts and titles? How do I revise a submission? How can I submit a multi-part file, such as multiple chapters for a book? Can I post related files (sound clips, data sets, etc.) alongside the published article? Can I post a reprint from a journal? A working paper in our repository site has been published in a slightly revised form in a journal. What should I do? I don't have electronic versions of old working papers that I'd like to include in the repository. Is it okay to scan the printed page to a PDF file? Yes--scanning printed pages is a great way to create PDF files for inclusion in the repository. There are two ways to scan a page: using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or scanning the page as an image. Making OCR scans requires careful proofreading and loses the original formatting of the documents. Image scans cannot be searched. The best solution takes advantage of both of these methods. Many software applications allow for the OCR capture of image scans. When documents are scanned this way, users see the image scan but search the full-text of the document. This is the preferred method for scanning documents for the repository. { back to top } When I copy and paste abstracts into the Submit form, some formatted text reverts to plain text. What's going on? When copying abstracts from a word processing file or a PDF file, and pasting the text into the submission form, you are taking text from an environment that supports fonts and text style changes. Because the abstract is intended to be presented on the web, text styles must be specified using HTML codes. If submitting an abstract in HTML format, please be sure to select the corresponding option on the submission form. The following HTML tags are recognized by the system and may be used to format an abstract (use lowercase tags): <p> - paragraph <br> - line break <strong> - strong\/bold <em> - italics\/emphasis <sub> - subscript <sup> - superscript { back to top } How do I include accents and special characters in the abstracts and titles? The repository software supports the worldwide character set (Unicode, utf-8). Accents, symbols, and other special characters may be copied and pasted into the abstract or title field from a word processing file or typed in directly. Windows users may also use the Character Map to insert these characters. Macintosh users may use the Character Palette (available via Edit > Special Characters in the Finder). { back to top } How do I revise a submission? To revise a submission that has been posted to the repository, contact the repository administrator with the new version. If the submission has been submitted, but not yet posted, you may revise it via your My Account page: Locate the article on your My Account page, and click the title. Click Revise Submission from the list of options in the left sidebar. Enter your changes in the Revise Submission form, and click Submit at the bottom of the page to submit your changes. (You only need to modify the portion of the form that corresponds to the changes you wish to make.) { back to top } How can I submit a multi-part file, such as multiple chapters for a book? Combine all the sections together as one Microsoft Word file or PDF file and submit that. To make one PDF file from multiple files, open the first PDF file, then choose Document>Insert Pages from Acrobat's menus to insert the second file (indicate it should go after the last page of the first file), and repeat for all documents. The result will be one compound PDF file which may then be submitted. If you feel that the one large PDF file might be too large for some people to download, we suggest that you submit the consolidated file as the full text of the article, and then upload the separate chapters or sections of the document as Associated Files. These files will appear on the web page alongside the complete document. For more information about uploading associated files, see \"Can I post related files...\" below. { back to top } Can I post related files (sound clips, data sets, etc.) alongside the published article? Yes. The bepress system refers to these supplementary items as Associated Files. You will be prompted to submit Associated Files when you upload your submissions. The name of the files you upload will appear on the web site along with your short description of it. Viewers must have the necessary software to open your files; that is not provided by the bepress system. Please be sure that there are no permissions issues related to use of the associated material. Sometimes, especially with images, you must write a letter seeking permission to use the material before it can be posted. Also note that where possible, items such as images, charts and tables that are referenced in the document (or otherwise an integral part of the document) should be included directly in the article itself and not posted just as associated files. { back to top } Can I post a reprint from a journal? It depends on what the journal allows, which is usually specified in their agreement with the author. If it would not violate copyright to post the reprint on your repository site, you're welcome to do so. Permissions for many publishers can be found at SHERPA RoMEO. { back to top } A working paper in our repository site has been published in a slightly revised form in a journal. What should I do? Many journals do not have any restrictions on working papers that preceded an article, especially if substantial revisions were made. You should check your author agreement with the journal to confirm that there is no problem with leaving the working paper on the site. The repository would constitute noncommercial use. Assuming the working paper does remain on posted in the repository, it is a good idea to include the citation to the published article on the cover page of the repository working paper. Please contact the repository administrator to request this change. { back to top } Browse Collections Disciplines Authors Search Enter search terms: Select context to search: in this repository across all repositories Advanced Search Notify me via email or RSS Author Corner Author FAQ Submit Research LINKS Eva B.
