Standards for Religious Representatives and Guests Lyon does not dictate or restrict a student's religious exploration; therefore, there are times in which it invites various groups or representatives to its campus on behalf of the Office of the Chaplain with the understanding that the guidelines below are followed: Religious groups and representatives shall respect the right of students to maintain privacy; to accept, question, or reject religious faith; and to affiliate with, decline to affiliate with, or disaffiliate themselves from any religous organization on campus. While Lyon College recognizes that appropriate expressions of evangelism may be integral to a group's religious convinctions and activities, it holds that behaviors are unacceptable. Those behaviors include, but are not limited to, the following: Door-to-door or other organized campaigns within residence halls (where students rightly expect their privacy to be respected) Visual displays or organizational announcements in classroom space Literature or survey campaigns where individuals cannot easily or comfortably avoid being approached by those distributing literature or surveys Persisting personal invitations of any kind to a group's meetings or activities after the invitee has clearly indicated a desire not to participate in that group's life or activities Religious groups and representatives shall follow all campus rules and regulations as well as policies from the Chaplain's Office, which specify the purpose for which the purposes for which these groups function on campus. Religous representatives are not permitted in Residence Life Facilities. Religious groups and representatives shall not engage in actions which have an adverse impact on the academic\/vocational pursuits or the emotional\/physical well-being of students or in actions, which by force or coercion (phsyical or psychological) cause students to be absent from campus activities which are a regular aspect of a liberal arts education (e.g., study abroad).
