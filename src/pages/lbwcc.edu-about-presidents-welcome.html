Wallace Community College has a long history of excellence. The College has served the people of South Alabama for over 50 years with affordable academic, technical, and workforce programs. We offer a variety of programs on each of our campuses as well as virtual options which allow for flexible scheduling. Our mission is to provide high-quality education, training, and cultural enrichment to the citizens of our service area. All students benefit from the expertise and dedication of our caring faculty and staff. Each year the College offers scholarships to qualified students in the areas of academics, athletics, leadership, performing arts, and service. In addition to the traditional scholarships offered by the College, scholarships are also available through the Lurleen B. Wallace Community College Foundation. Personally, LBWCC holds a special place in my heart as I am a product of the Alabama Community College System. I grew up in Opp and graduated from LBWCC. During my time at LBWCC, I was a member of the Saints Baseball Team before transferring to Troy University to extend my playing career. I know first-hand how the two-year college system can change the lives of students. Post-Secondary Education and success looks different for each of us. Contrary to popular belief, college is for everyone. It is our goal at LBWCC to help design a personalized career pathway that works for each individual and his or her schedule. LBWCC is here to help our students meet their educational goals no matter their situation. The College serves high school students, traditional and non-traditional college students, veterans, and incumbent workers. We provide world-class, affordable education and training for our diverse community. LBWCC is actively involved in addressing the ever-changing educational, economic, and cultural needs of the state. The College offers dual enrollment, technical training, 2-to-4-year transfer, adult education, and community education that prepares students for Alabama\u2019s growing workforce. We work closely with our community leaders to produce the skilled workers needed in today\u2019s economy. The College is committed to economically changing the region in which we serve by innovative technology and progressive thinking. We are committed to our mission of Teaching. Learning. Growing.
