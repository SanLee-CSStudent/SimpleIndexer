This is an entirely new policy that will apply to all NIH-funded projects that generate scientific data. As a PI on a current NIH award (or an active applicant for NIH funding), we want to make you aware of this coming change and encourage you to begin preparing for it. University Libraries and Research, Innovation & Impact are actively developing resources to support you in this endeavor. Next steps Please review existing resources and preliminary guidance to prepare your current NIH grant(s) and any new proposals for the policy change. Under the new NIH policy, researchers are required to include detailed plans on how data will be managed and shared during the entire funded period, including: Data storage Access policies and procedures Preservation Metadata standards and distribution approaches You must submit a Data Management and Sharing Plan to comply with the new policy. Compliance with the submitted DMS plan will become a term of condition during the award funding period. More information For more information, please review the NIH DMS Policy resource webpage. For questions or to request a consult, email the Library Data Management team. We will provide ongoing updates to assist researchers and research assistants with this transition. COVID-19 Update \u2013 Research Restart Plan Phase 6 Link: Friday, March 25, 2022 Dear Colleagues, With the recent update to the face covering guidance and FAQ, we will transition to Phase 6 of the Research Restart Plan. Under this final phase of the plan, all types of on-site research are allowed. It is important, however, that we all remain vigilant in protecting the University community and continue to follow campus recommendations for testing, vaccination, and work arrangements. Face Covering Guidance The Research Restart Plan follows University's face covering guidance. Based on current public health conditions and aligned with CDC guidance, masks are recommended, but not required, in most indoor spaces including classrooms. We will continue to require that surgical masks or higher-grade masks be worn: in any building\/facility that is operated by or affiliated with the University where patients or human research subjects participating in clinical research are seen in person; in locations where personal protective equipment (including masks) has always been required to maintain safety protocols for situations with high hazards, such as areas where regulated chemicals are used or stored and other laboratory settings; and inside a Cat Tran shuttle or any other public transportation provided by the University, as recommended by the CDC and TSA. Surgical masks are three-ply disposable masks. Higher grade masks include KN95 or KF94 masks. Locations and\/or environments that require the use of respiratory protection (N95) must be enrolled in the University Respiratory Protection Program. Researchers are responsible for ensuring their staff \u2013 including employees, students and DCCs \u2013 and visitors use the appropriate face coverings and\/or PPE for the setting. Voluntary use of N95 Respiratory Protection Use of self-supplied N95 respirators continues to be allowed, but individuals choosing to use an N95 must follow the UArizona Voluntary Use of Respiratory Protection During COVID-19 guidelines. Although employees voluntarily choosing to wear an N95 mask are not required to have their N95 mask fit tested, the University will offer N95 fit testing for faculty, staff or students who voluntarily choose to provide and wear their own N95 respirator. Contact Risk Management Services at 520-621-1790 or risk@arizona.edu to request an N95 fit test. RII will continue to monitor conditions and changes to University protocols and communicate the most updated information to this group. I am grateful for your thoughtful approach to continuing research as we mark the two-year anniversary of navigating the pandemic response. Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Cantwell Senior Vice President for Research and Innovation Updated UAccess Research (UAR) System Now Available Link: Tuesday, January 25, 2022 UAccess Research (UAR) has been updated and is now available for proposal routing, and other sponsored project modules. Thank you to the campus research community for all the cooperation and patience in completing three major system implementation projects in close succession! Thank you, especially, to the UAR Campus Experience Advisors for diligently representing the campus user perspective and providing support for campus users along with volunteer Campus Ambassadors. For information on using UAR, please consult the following resources: Video demos, instructional materials, and support contacts: See the Resource page for the UAccess Research Update (NetId required). Training and office hours: See UAR Update Training (registration required). Zoom training followed by virtual office hours: Days and times vary through Feb. 4 In-person office hours: Mondays from 10-11 a.m., Feb. 7 through Mar. 28 In-person office hours: Wednesdays from 2-3 p.m., Feb. 9 through Mar. 30 Zoom office hours: Alternating days and times, February through March As always, please check with your individual department and college Research Administration team for additional guidance and support. How will the UAR update affect you? New UAR location: The UAccess portal will be updated with the new UAR system at 9 a.m. on Jan. 25. To access the system now or update saved browser bookmarks, use the new URL: https:\/\/arizona.kuali.co\/dashboard. Fully re-route proposals in the new UAR system by 5 p.m. on March 4 if the temporary Smartsheet proposal routing tool was used for approval and sponsor submission during UAR system conversion. Immediate updates: The University will receive security updates and new system features on a continuous basis. No more VPN: Say goodbye to your VPN woes. You will be able to log in with your UA NetID, password, and NetID+ authentication without having to connect through VPN. This is great for traveling faculty or those places where VPN access is blocked. Fewer routing stops: Lead unit pre-approval will no longer be required. Proposals will route simultaneously and immediately to investigators and department approvers. Convenient dashboard: The new dashboard will increase transparency by providing greater visibility to work in progress. The \u201Cproposals not routing\u201D feature enables reviewers \/ approvers to see which proposals include them in the route path and will be routed to them, whether they are the Lead Unit or not. Search everything: Searching for what you need just got a whole lot more flexible. The dynamic Search Records feature scours all available fields for your specified words or numbers. For questions or more information, contact Sponsored Projects Services at sponsor@arizona.edu or UARHelp@arizona.edu. All Announcements FAQs Researchers ask great questions. We've done our best to answer them. Below is a random sampling of a few of these. Are companies or nonprofits involved in the project? Answer this question \u2018Yes\u2019 if this proposal involves companies or non-profits as partners if they are not already listed as a sponsor or prime sponsor. This would be the case for proposals where a company or nonprofit is a subrecipient, consultant, advisor, etc. If the answer is \u2018Yes\u2019 then it is required in the UAccess Research (UAR) proposal to list the full name(s) of any company or non-profit organization that will be involved as a partner, separated by commas. Answer this question \u2018No\u2019 if the partner is already captured in the UAR proposal as the sponsor or prime sponsor. Company and non-profit information helps RII to identify researchers, companies and non-profits interested in partnerships to strengthen responses to future sponsorship opportunities Contact Research Development Services (RDS) at ResDev@email.arizona.edu(link sends e-mail) for additional guidance about this question.
