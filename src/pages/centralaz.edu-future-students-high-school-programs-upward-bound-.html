CAC Upward Bound is a FREE pre-college, academic support program that prepares high school students in grades 9 through 12 to become successful college students. Upward Bound is a federally funded program. Upward Bound is one of the original TRIO programs founded through the Educational Opportunity Act of 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty initiatives. Eligibility To be eligible, a student must: \u2022 Have the desire and motivation to pursue further education after high school. \u2022 Have completed 8th grade but not yet enrolled in 12th grade and attend one of the target schools \u2013 Coolidge High School, Casa Grande Union High School or Vista Grande High School. \u2022 Be a permanent resident or US Citizen. \u2022 First-generation college students (neither parent should have received a bachelor\u2019s degree at the time of application) and\/or meet the federal family income guidelines set by the U.S. Department of Education. Student Application TEACHER Recommendation Form COUNSELOR Recommendation Form What to Expect While Upward Bound can be hard work, it\u2019s also a great deal of fun where students are encouraged to be themselves, work hard, play hard, and make friends from different area schools. Students are given the opportunity to experiment with different classes than the ones at their high schools, which enables them to discover talents and interests they didn\u2019t know existed. The students learn the benefits of team-work through group activities and open discussions with their peers, program instructors and administrators. They also discover that although they come from different schools and different situations, they\u2019re all heading in the same direction \u2014 Toward Higher Education. Academic Year and Summer Programs CAC\u2019s Project Upward Bound operates in two sessions: academic year and summer program. Academic Year During the academic year, students report to Upward Bound sessions on your HS campus and at CAC\u2019s Signal Peak Campus. Summer Academy During the summer, students participate in the six\u2013week academy, which allows them to experience college on a smaller scale. For one week the students will participate in a residential experience at CAC: \u2022 Reside in one of the residence halls \u2022 Eat their meals in the cafeteria \u2022 Attend classes during the day \u2022 Receive tutoring \u2022 Participate in structured evening activities, and \u2022 Attend various trips and college visits The other 5 weeks of the summer academy will take place during the day only. Transportation assistance will be available. Students enroll in courses they will take in the upcoming school year, such as: \u2022 Biology \u2022 Chemistry \u2022 Algebra \u2022 Geometry \u2022 Calculus \u2022 English \u2022 Foreign languages, and \u2022 A variety of other Electives \u2022 Students who have completed 10th grade have the opportunity to take college level courses at CAC once they have passed placement tests. Services Tutoring Tutorial services are available to all UB participants. Students who have difficulty in a particular class will be required to attend tutoring but students who are doing well and wish to remain ahead in their classes are also encouraged to receive tutoring. Assessment and Advising Students work individually with the administrative staff and instructors on areas such as personal inventories, career searches, high school course selection, resume writing, and study skills. Exposure to Various Events Students will have the opportunity to attend special activities in the community such as plays, museum trips, art exhibits, workshops and community service activities. Financial Advising The administrative staff in conjunction with CAC\u2019s financial aid office works with the students and their parents to complete federal financial aid forms and search for scholarships. SAT or ACT Prep Each year junior and senior students are provided a prep course to help them with the college entrance exams In addition, Upward Bound provides students with fee waivers which relieve students and their parents from the financial responsibility of having to pay for the SAT or ACT College Tours Students visit a number of institutions of higher ed. Students tour campuses, meet with students and faculty, and make direct contact with the college or university\u2019s admissions department. College Application and Selection Staff will assist students with college applications and scholarships. Scholastic Advising Our staff maintains contact with students\u2019 guidance counselors and teachers to ensure each student is obtaining courses necessary for college enrollment. FAQs What does participation CAC\u2019s Upward Bound program cost? Zero. There\u2019s no monetary cost to participate in Upward Bound. It is a free, federally-funded program. The only investment is one of time, commitment, and dedication. Will I fit in? If you want to go to college, but don\u2019t really know all the steps it\u2019ll take to get there, then Upward Bound is for you. Our students don\u2019t have all the answers either, but they know enough to ask questions in order to get the right answers. Also, if your grades are good, but can be better, or if they\u2019re great but you want a challenge, then you\u2019re in the right place. What kinds of classes can I take at Upward Bound? Upward Bound offers students the opportunity to enroll in classes usually not offered by their home high schools. If you find you have academic areas where you need a little extra assistance, you can enroll in supplemental courses in English and Math that can help you raise your test scores and polish your skills. If I enroll in CAC\u2019s Upward Bound, does this mean I have to attend CAC once I graduate from high school? No, not at all. While CAC is a great option to start your post-secondary education the program will assist you with the enrollment process at any school you choose to attend. Interested?
