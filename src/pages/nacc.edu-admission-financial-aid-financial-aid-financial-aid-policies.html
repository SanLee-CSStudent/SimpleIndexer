Also, a student must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.00. Please refer to the Student Handbook for detailed Financial Aid Policies and Procedures. Beginning Fall 2020: Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy According to 34 CFR 668-16(e), there are two major components of satisfactory academic progress: the qualitative component (cumulative in-program GPA) and quantitative component (timeframe of completion). Qualitative \u2013Grade Point Average (GPA): Financial Aid recipients must maintain the following grade point averages (GPA) according to the number of hours attempted. This includes all hours attempted, whether or not financial aid was received or courses were successfully completed. Grades for developmental courses, incompletes, and periods where academic bankruptcy was applied must be factored into the GPA calculation. Grades of \u201CW\u201D will not be calculated into the GPA. Repeated Courses: The first repeat shall not be factored into the GPA calculation; however, all additional attempts shall be factored into the GPA calculation. GPA is only calculated using coursework taken at NACC. GPA requirements for long-term certificate and degree seeking students If the student has attempted 0-21 hours, they must maintain a 1.5 GPA. If the student has attempted 22-32 hours, they must maintain a 1.75 GPA If the student has attempted 33 or more hours, they must maintain a 2.0 GPA. GPA requirements for short-term certificate (24-29 credit hours) students If the student has attempted 0-12 hours, they must maintain a 1.5 GPA. If the student has attempted 13 or more hours, they must maintain a 2.0 GPA. Quantitative \u2013 Pace of Progression Requirement (PACE): All credit hours attempted by the student will be calculated in the completion rate which includes: Transfer courses accepted by the institution, developmental course, incompletes, periods where academic bankruptcy was applied, and forgiven courses. Completion rate (attempted class hours) required by long-term certificate and degree seeking students If the student has attempted 0-21 hours, they must maintain a 58% completion rate. If the student has attempted 22-32 hours, they must maintain a 62% completion rate. If the student has attempted 33 or more hours, they must maintain a 67% completion rate. Completion rate (attempted class hours) required short-term certificate (24-29 credit hours) students If the student has attempted 0-12\u2026 hours they must maintain a 58% completion rate. If the student has attempted 13 or more\u2026 hours they must maintain a 67% completion rate. Quantitative \u2013 Maximum Time-Frame (MAX): The maximum timeframe for the completion of an undergraduate degree program is defined as no more than 150 percent of the normal timeframe required to complete the degree program. Example: For a degree programs that require 64 credit hours to graduate, maximum timeframe is 96 attempted credit hours. All attempted courses, to include transfer credits accepted by the institution, incompletes, periods where Academic Bankruptcy was applied, forgiven courses, and developmental courses, must be factored into the calculation for Maximum Time Frame.
