The office fulfills this mission through: Providing newly hired tenure-track faculty with a solid base and introduction to the college through the on-boarding program, Providing professional development opportunities to all faculty \u2013full and part-time, Providing in-house training and resources to support faculty in the classroom to increase student retention and success. Faculty have access to a number of resources through the Faculty Community in Blackboard. This community brings together all faculty at Calhoun, full and part-time. Housed here is information about professional development opportunities (internal and external), instructional best practices, faculty resources and support services for students. Faculty are encouraged to check the community often for updates and opportunities. The community is accessed through the instructor\u2019s Blackboard account. Beginning Fall 2021, a NEW model for faculty professional development is being introduced. The goal is for each faculty member to achieve 12 professional development hours annually. This change will allow for the pursuit of professional development that is relevant and of interest to each individual faculty member. Professional development hours can be acquired both internally and from external sources. Each professional development hour is equal to 60 minutes. Professional development credit for internal activities will be granted through registration and attendance at events. To submit verification of external professional development hours, please use this form. Please note that documentation is required to support external PD hours. This documentation could include completion certificates, conference programs, etc. Professional development offerings will be planned a year in advance. To view the catalog of offerings for Fall 2021, please click here. A new catalog of offerings will be shared each semester. This information is also available by clicking on the monthly calendars above under \u2018Resources\u2019. To register for an activity or workshop, click on the title (highlighted in blue) in either the catalog or calendar and you will be taken to the registration page. Complete the required information and you\u2019re all set! When the workshop is held, there will be digital sign in so that you get credit for attending the activity or workshop. Tracking and reporting will be handled by the Faculty Development Office. The Faculty Development Advisory Committee provides suggestions on professional development needs for faculty. Minutes from committee meetings can be found on Calhoun\u2019s Personnel Webpage. As director, I welcome and encourage feedback and suggestions related to professional development.
