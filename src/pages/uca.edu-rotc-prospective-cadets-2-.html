Facts about enrolling into UCA Army ROTC Enrolling in ROTC does not mean you are joining the military. You may not have to attend Basic Training if you take military science courses. You do not have to be advanced in fitness to join. UCA Army ROTC offers a physical fitness class to UCA students who would like to work out with us without an ROTC commitment. You will have plenty of time to participate in extra curricular activities; we encourage them! You do not need to purchase any uniforms or equipment; we will provide them. Not everyone in ROTC is pursuing a military career. You are able to study abroad while enrolled in Army ROTC. Not all commissioning cadets have to serve Active Duty. You can also serve as a Reserve or National Guard officer. Contact Us Meadors Hall 201 Donaghey Avenue Conway, AR 72035 501-852-2384 uca_rotc@uca.edu Stay Connected ? ? ?
