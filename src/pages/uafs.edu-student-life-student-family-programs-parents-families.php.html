The college exploration process is an exciting and important time for your family. The University of Arkansas \u2013 Fort Smith recognizes that family plays an important role in a student's college selection and their success throughout their college career. One of the goals of the Office of New Student and Family Programs is to introduce new students and families to services and programs available on campus. The most important role you can play in this process is listening to and supporting your student. Help them through the application process and in applying for financial aid including scholarships. At the same time, encourage them to remain focused on high school academics. Questions? Contact New Student and Family Programs by email at LionFamily@uafs.edu or by phone at 479-788-7319. We are located in the Smith-Pendergraft Campus Center 111A and are open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

The size of our university, just over 6,000 students, fosters a sense of belonging that isn't easily replicated at larger institutions. Our faculty take a personal interest in our student's lives and their academic and career goals. This tight-knit community gives UAFS students the confidence to roam, explore, and achieve amazing things for themselves and their families. For those who want to live in the heart of campus life, UAFS offers two residence halls with a full-service dining hall along with an apartment complex for upperclassmen. Who will advise my student? Each student is assigned a professional advisor, college advisor, or faculty advisor depending on their major. We want students to have contact with their advisor to plan their career goals, long-term academic plans, monitor their academic progress, and assist with the registration process. Students must contact and work with their advisors. Students need to know and follow their degree plans and understand the university policies and programs. If my student needs additional help in a class, are resources available? There are a variety of services available to help students succeed in the classroom. The Gordon Kelley Academic Success Center (ASC), located in the Vines Building, provides a variety of free services including math labs, a writing center, group tutoring, and computer support programs for a wide range of courses. The ASC provides many academic support services from mini academic workshops such as note-taking, time management, and study skills to individual and group tutoring to assist students with specific challenges of the course content and the student's overall college experience. Do I have to pay all my student's tuition and fees at registration? Payment is due by 5 p.m. on the published payment deadline date before classes begin. Payment deadlines can be found on the Registration Calendar. Payments may be made by debit card, credit card, or personal check. For a nominal fee, students have the option of setting up an installment plan during the fall and spring semesters. Installment plans are not available in summer. What is an Academic Early Alert? We want your student to be successful in their courses, so we have implemented an Academic Early Alert Program! Faculty can initiate an academic early alert if a student is having academic problems in a course such as missing classes, poor test scores, needing additional skills support such as note-taking, etc. Students will receive an academic alert providing feedback on their progress and will be encouraged to see their faculty or advisor for additional help. Do you provide job placement services? Yes. Career Services provides UAFS students and graduates with a full range of job placement guidance. The professional staff will advise students on a variety of areas such as coordinating internships, full-time and part-time employment, and providing job search assistance with resumes and interviewing workshops. My student has special needs. Who can we contact about this? UAFS makes every effort to offer equal educational opportunities for all students. To ensure a total university experience for students with disabilities, we seek to provide reasonable accommodations and services for students who have physical, emotional, or learning disabilities. The underlying philosophy of the program is to provide support, where possible, that will maximize each student\u2019s opportunities for academic success. Visit the ADA Services page for more information. Do you offer online classes? UAFS is one of Arkansas's largest providers of real-time, web-based courses. We offer a variety of alternative delivery methods to meet the growing needs of our diverse student population, including online, evening, and weekend courses. Many of our general education classes are offered online. Please note, however, that alternate delivery classes are often the first to fill, so students should register as early as possible. Are there graduate assistants in the classroom? No. All of our classes are taught by professional faculty. Our professors maintain scheduled office hours so they can assist students outside the classroom. And since we\u2019re a learning-centered rather than research-driven institution, the number one priority of faculty is to ensure that UAFS students receive a quality education. Is there housing available? Yes. The Office of Housing and Residential Life is committed to creating a residential community that supports a vibrant learning experience at UAFS. The university currently offers two on-campus housing options: Lion\u2019s Den Residence Hall \u2014 Home to primarily first-year students, the Lion's Den is a sustainable design and features Living and Learning Communities focused on student success and civic engagement. Residents enjoy a variety of suite-style room options including one-, two-, and three-bedroom floor plans with four to five people in each spacious suite. Amenities consist of fully furnished rooms, \"loftable\" extra-long twin beds, community lounges, safety and security features, and residential programming. The on-site dining facility accommodates students with flexible meal plans in a setting that is both convenient and comfortable. The dining hall is a buffet-style facility with several healthy options. Sebastian Commons Apartments \u2014 Sebastian Commons is an exclusive apartment community that offers a unique student housing experience for upperclassmen who wish to reside on campus. Apartment layouts include one-, two-, and four-bedroom floorplans. Amenities include all basic utilities paid, full kitchen, individual rooms, queen-size beds, gated parking, a sand volleyball court, and basketball courts on-site. All rooms are equipped with extended basic cable as well as internet service. Laundry facilities are located on-site in both Sebastian Commons and the Lion\u2019s Den. For information on either facility, contact the Housing Office at 479-788-7340. Is the campus safe? Officers of the University Police Department patrol campus buildings and parking lots 24 hours a day, including weekends and holidays. UPD also provides, by request, a security escort for students who are walking alone on campus at night or a jump start should students need assistance with their vehicle. Both services are available free of charge. What events or activities are available for my student on campus? Whether students choose to take in a show, watch a battle between two nationally ranked athletic teams, or just relax with friends at a movie, campus life at UAFS offers something for everyone. Our athletics program features men's baseball, women's volleyball, and men's and women's basketball, cross country, tennis, and golf. UAFS has more than 100 student organizations including an active Campus Activities Board and Student Government Association. Our students perform throughout the semester in the jazz band, concert chorale, vocal jazz, symphonic band, and drama productions.
