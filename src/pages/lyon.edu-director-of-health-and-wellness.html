The state of Arkansas requires an official copy of your immunization records showing proof of 2 MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) immunizations. The records may come from your physician, clinic, hospital, health department, or any Arkansas school. Records from out of state schools cannot be accepted per state law. A copy of serological test showing immunity to these diseases can also be accepted. Official means that the record contains a header, logo, physician or other medical professional signature, embossed stamp, or the name of the school to indicate the record\u2019s source. These documents are due prior to the start of classes in the fall or spring semester, and must be in the Health and Wellness office no later than JULY 31st., for fall semester and December 31st for Spring semester. If these are not submitted by the specified time a hold may be placed on your account until the requirements are met unless other arrangements have been made prior to classes starting.
