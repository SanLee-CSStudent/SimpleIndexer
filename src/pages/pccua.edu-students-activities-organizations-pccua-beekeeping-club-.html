Unlock The Mystery! We are excited to announce our East Central Arkansas Beepers Association! As you may know there has been a significant reduction in our bee population, and we are forming a club in our area to educate the community and help with this problem. If you are interested in joining our group, come and attend our meeting. You do not need to have bees to participate, just an interest in beekeeping and what they do for us. Additional information may be found at Arkansas Beekeepers Association.
