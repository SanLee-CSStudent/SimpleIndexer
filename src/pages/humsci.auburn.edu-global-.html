BRUNO ITALY STUDY ABROAD FAQ Previous Next Office of Global Education In our increasingly globalized society, it is critical for Auburn University graduates to enter the workplace with a full appreciation and understanding of the differing values and customs of world cultures; how the world\u2019s markets, goods, and services are interconnected; how hunger and food insecurity are addressed; and how environmental sustainability issues affect quality of life worldwide. The College of Human Sciences is committed to educating socially responsible global citizens who thoroughly understand the value of working across borders, analyzing information from a variety of perspectives, approaching problem solving in non-ethnocentric ways, and understanding the complexity of issues facing individuals, families, and communities. To that end, the College of Human Sciences offers a wide variety of international opportunities, to allow both undergraduate and graduate students the ability to add value to their educational credentials.
