However, if they have not completed College Algebra and Comp I, they must submit ACT scores to determine whether they must take developmental courses. Unconditional Admission Beginning students who have ACT scores of 19 or higher on the English, mathematics, and reading parts of the ACT examination and who have, upon graduating from high school after May 1, 1997, completed the core curriculum with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale will be admitted unconditionally to Southern Arkansas University. Conditional Admission Beginning Students who do not qualify for unconditional admission but who have received a composite ACT score of 16 or higher will be conditionally admitted to Southern Arkansas University. Students admitted with conditions may take a minimum of 16 credits during their first regular semester. In addition, students admitted with conditions are required to meet with an assigned academic advisor at least twice a semester to assess their academic progress. Students admitted conditionally must take developmental courses in the subjects in which they scored lower than a 19 on the ACT examination. The four developmental courses are Fundamentals of Reading, Fundamentals of Writing, Fundamentals of Mathematics, and Intermediate Algebra. These students must successfully complete in a regular and consistent manner all developmental courses that they are required to take. Successful completion in a regular and consistent manner means that required developmental courses be taken each semester the student is registered. If two or more developmental courses are required, the student must register for at least two developmental courses (Fundamentals of Mathematics and Intermediate Algebra cannot be taken concurrently). The student will not be permitted to register for a fourth semester until all developmental courses are successfully completed.
