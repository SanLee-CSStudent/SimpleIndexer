South, for short. Home to nearly 14,000 students and more than 125 academic programs, South is a dynamic community of leaders and learners who support and challenge one another to be actively engaged citizens who advance the Gulf Coast region and the world. Founded in 1963, South\u2019s vision is to foster an environment that couples engaging learning experiences with high-level research, enabling our faculty and students to be leaders in their disciplines. The unique and beautiful Gulf Coast region is a catalyst for discovery and innovation, and South\u2019s 1,200-acre campus has been transformed over the past decade with new facilities and resources for teaching, housing and recreation, health sciences, the arts, engineering, computer science and athletics. Jaguar athletes compete in 17 NCAA Division I sports, including baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The coastal region is healthier because of the USA Health system. Through its five components \u2014 Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Hospital, University Hospital, Mitchell Cancer Institute, USA Health Physicians Group and the College of Medicine \u2014 and supported by the College of Nursing and the Pat Capps Covey College of Allied Health Professions \u2014 USA Health provides care to hundreds of thousands of people, and is a training ground for future physicians and healthcare professionals. The University has implemented a strategic plan that is organized around five major priorities: Student Access and Success, Enhancement of Research and Graduate Education, Global Engagement, Excellence in Health Care, and University-Community Engagement. These priorities are the guiding influence in developing a strong, consistent vision for the future of the University. USA is a place where students discover and strengthen their career passions, and form connections that result in lifelong relationships. At South, we look at the world and see things that we have the power to change, affect and shape \u2014 together. So that\u2019s exactly what we do, every single day. We are South!
