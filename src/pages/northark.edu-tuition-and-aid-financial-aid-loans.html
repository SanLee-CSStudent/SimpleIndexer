William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program \u2014 Loans made through this program are referred to as Direct Loans. Eligible students borrow directly from the U.S. Department of Education at participation schools. Direct Loans include subsidized and unsubsidized Direct Stafford Loans. Direct Subsidized Loan \u2014 The loan is based on financial need and you will not owe any interest on them before repayment. The federal government \u201Csubsidizes\u201D (or pays) the interest while you\u2019re in school at least half time, for the six months after you leave school (your grace period) and during a deferment (a postponement of loan payments). Award amounts vary based on grade level in school, dependency status and other financial assistance received. Direct Unsubsidized Loan \u2014 The loan is not based on financial need and interest is charged on the loan from the time it is disbursed until it is repaid in full. Students have the option of paying the interest during deferment periods and during the grace period, or they may capitalize the interest. Capitalizing interest means that it will be added to the principal amount of the loan and it will increase the amount to be repaid. Award amounts vary based on grade level in school and dependency status. Failure to repay a student loan will result in the student being in default status. Consequences of defaulting can include a negative impact on a student's credit score, additional fees, garnished wages and\/or tax returns, and being ineligible for additional federal aid. Northark's 2017 Three-Year Official default rate is 14.6%. This rate can be compared with others schools at https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/offices\/OSFAP\/defaultmanagement\/cdr.html During the 2018\/2019 Academic Year 10% of Northark\u2019s students borrowed Federal Direct Student Loans.
