Award recipients will participate in leadership activities including service opportunities, seminars and networking events with university administration, community leaders and campus student leaders. In addition, recipients will receive a $1,000 scholarship.* To be considered for the award, students must meet Ouachita\u2019s minimum requirements for unconditional admission: 2.75\/4.0 high school GPA and 20 ACT\/1030 SAT. They must also be nominated by a Ouachita alumna\/alumnus. An alumna\/alumnus cannot recommend an immediate family member (child or sibling). The number of awards presented each year varies based on funds available. Awards are funded in part by the Ouachita license plate program. Alumni can recommend up to four students for consideration. NEW FOR 2021-22 Students cannot apply for the Tiger Network Leadership award without first being nominated by an alumna\/alumnus. Once a nomination form is received, the nominated student will receive an e-mail with the link to apply for the award. Once both of these are received, the nomination and application process is complete. Please ask a Ouachita graduate that you know well so he or she can speak to your leadership experience and be patient and respectful as they may receive multiple requests for nominations. If you receive multiple nominations, you only need to apply once. If you receive additional e-mails asking you to fill out your application, simply disregard. Applications for students entering Ouachita in the Fall of 2022 are due by 5 p.m., Dec. 1, 2021. The selection committee will review applications, and recipients will be notified in January. Applying for this award does not substitute for the regular scholarship application process. For questions about the Tiger Network Leadership Award Program, e-mail alumni@obu.edu. *$500 will be awarded for the student's first semester and $500 will be added for the Spring semester if recipients attend the events required in the fall. Alumni Nomination Form OUACHITA LICENSE PLATES The Tiger Network Leadership Award Scholarship is funded in part by the purchase of Ouachita license plates through the Arkansas DMV. The more alumni and friends who drive with Tiger pride, the more students we can help attend Ouachita. Plates are $35 in addition to regular renewal fees. See a revenue office representative or visit the specialty plates site here for further details. Tiger For Life Tiger for Life is a reflection of something as old as Ouachita itself. This campus, this experience, this family finds a place in your heart and stays for life! A Tiger for Life is thankful to those whose support preserved Ouachita in the past, celebrates and promotes the Ouachita of today, and joins with others to guarantee Ouachita's existence for future students. The Tiger for Life brand was created in the spring of 2010 by a group of 13 Ouachita students working on a class project. This became much more than an assignment to these students. It became their \"gift\" to Ouachita's future. The Tiger For Life initiative is now led by members of the Ouachita Student Foundation. They host various activities throughout the year to encourage students to live a life of thankfulness and philanthropy. That includes appreciation for those who helped make their educational experience at Ouachita possible, but also engagement with non-profits and ministries that connect with each student\u2019s passions. All incoming students receive a Tiger for For Life t-shirt during WOW (freshman orientation) and the flagship OSF philanthropy event is Tiger For Life week which is hosted each spring with various philanthropy-focused events. The Podcast The Tiger For Life podcast launched in April of 2020 as a way to connect and engage alumni during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Alumni Relations Office plans to continue to produce regular content in the future hearing stories and updates from Ouachita alumni and friends. You can listen here or on the following podcast platforms: Apple Podcasts Google Podcasts SoundCloud Spotify Stitcher Overcast iHeart Radio Training Up Tigers legacy program The Ouachita community is a family and the Ouachita Alumni Relations team works hard to connect our circle.

Signature Events The Office of Alumni Relations hosts various events throughout the year to help alumni stay connected to each other and to their alma mater.
