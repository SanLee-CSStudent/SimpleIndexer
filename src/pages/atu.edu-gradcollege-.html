Here are a few examples of the hands-on experiences you can expect to take part in as a student at Arkansas Tech. INTERNSHIPS \"The internship experience at ATU helped me gain valuable experience in the field of Strength and Conditioning, and built connections that will last a lifetime. I was fortunate to be selected to complete an internship at the University of Michigan in Olympic Sports Strength & Conditioning in Fall 2017. Through the internship I gained hands on experience with elite athletes and coaches in multiple sports. Less than one year after finishing my degree at ATU I received a call to explore a possible opportunity at Michigan because the internship allowed me to make an impression on the coaches where they could evaluate my abilities and desire to be in the field. I was ultimately selected for a role with Michigan Medicine working on concussion research as a Research Strength and Conditioning Coach and allocate part of my time in the weight room assisting the strength coaches with all Olympic teams.\" Kaitlin Burgess, MS Strength & Conditioning PRACTICUMS \"Arkansas Tech University provided the opportunity to enhance my education through experience. The Graduate Assistantship program utilized my academic pursuit by allowing me the chance to share what I've learned with others as an instructor in the English and World Languages department. The writing lab environment engendered a flurry of international peers, colleagues and pupils, to work with from across the globe.\" Dustin Freeman, MA English-TESL RESEARCH \"I\u2019ve been fortunate to receive individualized attention from faculty at ATU, even those in departments outside Behavioral Sciences. My thesis chair, Dr. Rebecca Goldstein, has gone above and beyond in directing and refining my skill set and knowledge base. Outside of my own lab, I\u2019ve been fortunate to be exposed to several different research methods used in other labs via my coursework and faculty involvement. The willingness to help is both within Behavioral Sciences and without, as other departments have been willing to support interdisciplinary learning. I have been encouraged and the faculty demonstrate a sense of involvement in my accomplishments both now and in the future. At ATU, it\u2019s not about where you come from, it\u2019s about what you do with it.\" Taylor Rigsby, MS Psychology Ready to get started?
