We believe that students should be responsible for their personal conduct, practice civility and ethical decision making, and understand that they are ultimately responsible for the consequences that their decision may bring. Through student conduct, we are responsible for enforcing student conduct and university guidelines as outlined in the SAU Student Handbook for individuals, campus activities, and student organizations.
