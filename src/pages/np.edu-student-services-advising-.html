The advisors can help you choose appropriate classes that fit your degree plan, advise you on academic decisions, and perform degree audits. You must consult with an advisor when you first enroll in classes at NPC. You should also consult with an advisor at any time during the semester when you feel it is necessary, and especially when you are making decisions about registration (adding, dropping, or withdrawing from classes). Transfer Degrees NPC has developed over 90 transfer degrees for specific program areas. These degrees allow you to complete your freshman and sophomore courses at NPC and then transfer into your degree program as a junior at our partner institutions. And, all courses are guaranteed to transfer. If one of these transfer degrees aligns with your education goals, it will be a better option for you than the Associate of Arts (AA) degree. Let the faculty mentor shown in the catalog for your selected degree or an academic advisor know the transfer degree you select so they can help you understand the degree plan and graduation map. Associate of Arts Degree If NPC does not have a transfer degree that meets your academic and career goals and you are planning to transfer with an AA degree, it is especially important to work with an academic advisor. The advisor can help you understand which classes on the AA will fulfill degree requirements at the transferring institution and which ones may not. Contact an Advisor You may contact one of the following advisors by visiting Enrollment Services, emailing npc.advising@np.edu, or calling 501-760-4159 or 1-844-806-8752 (toll-free). You can also schedule an appointment online.
