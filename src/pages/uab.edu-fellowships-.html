About Faculty Resources Student Resources Featured Fellowship Recipients Ophelia Johnson Wells It is largely because of the help and support of the UAB Fellowships Office that I graduated from UAB and Imperial College London with three degrees, debt free. The tireless efforts of the UAB Fellowships Office truly changed my life. Ophelia majored in biomedical engineering at UAB and was selected for the UNCF Merck Undergraduate Research Scholarship, the Goldwater Scholarship, and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. As a Marshall Scholar, Ophelia studied medical device design and entrepreneurship at Imperial College London. She currently works as a device verification engineer for Merck & Co. and is pursuing her PhD in electrical engineering at Drexel University. More Recipients ¡æ Ameen Barghi Applying for fellowships helped me reflect and construct a cohesive narrative to codify the next steps that I would take to achieve my goals. I made many of my closest friends that spanned all geographies. They have been some of the most accomplished, enthusiastic, and selfless people who continue to push me to be better every day. This experience changed my life. As a sophomore undergraduate neuroscience major, Ameen was awarded the Goldwater Scholarship. He went on to receive the Rhodes Scholarship and studied public policy at the University of Oxford before completing medical school at Harvard. More Recipients ¡æ Rebecca Hyde The UAB Fellowships Office gave me the most influential mentors of my college career. With their guidance, I was selected for the Critical Language Scholarship, the William Jefferson Clinton Scholarship, and the Boren Scholarship to gain real world experience abroad while having little to no financial burden associated with it. Without their help, I would not be in the position I am today, and I recommend every UAB student visit the office. Always up for the next adventure, Rebecca studied throughout the Middle East as an undergraduate international studies major -- including stints in Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Turkey, and Nepal. Rebecca completed a masters in communication studies at UAB and is currently working as an Immigration Services Officer with US Citizenship and Immigration Services. More Recipients ¡æ Emily Jennings Everyone says their Fulbright experience changed their lives, and that\u2019s absolutely true. If you want to move your mindset in a direction that will enable you to better understand people from all walks of life, understand the culture you come from and its place in the world, and learn to bring those two perspectives together to progress your respective field(s) and\/or society as a whole, then apply for a Fulbright grant. Having spent a semester at the University of Stirling as an undergraduate neuroscience major, Emily knew she wanted to pursue graduate studies abroad. She received the Fulbright Scholarship to earn a masters of neurosciences at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and she is currently working toward a second masters program at the University of Oxford in Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics. More Recipients ¡æ Kenneth Davis My experience working with the UAB Fellowships Office has been truly phenomenal. I walked into their office looking for simple guidance but emerged with much more than that. They were 100% invested in me and my future plans. They challenged me to look deep within myself, enabling me to fully express myself and pursue my goals. A chemistry and mathematics major, Kenneth was a Goldwater Scholarship nominee and recipient of the U.S. Department of State's Benjamin Gilman Scholarship and Freeman-ASIA Scholarship to Japan. Kenneth was also selected as a Fulbright Study\/Research Scholarship Finalist to Germany. He is pursuing an MD\/MBA at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
