History INTO UAB's English Language Programs have been serving English language learners in the Birmingham area since 2001. Established as a special project of a local educational collaboration called the Birmingham Area Consortium for Higher Education (BACHE), the program was developed to provide a professionally-staffed \u201Ccenter\u201D in adult English language and cross-cultural instruction for the member institutions and the region. Named the English Language and Culture Institute (ELCI), the program held its first class in Fall semester of 2001, and BACHE housed the program through December of 2003. In January of 2004, the ELCI was relocated to the School of Education of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). In the following years, the program experienced steady growth, both in service to UAB and through meeting ESL training needs in the greater Birmingham region. In 2009, the ELCI received approval from the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama system to serve as a designated \"institute\" at UAB. In the same year, the ELCI opened its Intensive English Program to pre-degree students and short-term students needing to improve their English for academic or professional purposes. It was renamed the UAB English Language Institute (ELI) in November 2010 and became part of the UAB College of Arts and Sciences. In 2015, UAB established a new joint venture with INTO University Partnerships called INTO UAB. The ELI became a part of that partnership as the academic wing of the enterprise. The ELI \u2013 now the English Language Programs of INTO UAB \u2013 looks forward to continued growth, and it remains committed to deliver English language and cross-cultural training programs with the high standard of quality that is the program's hallmark.
