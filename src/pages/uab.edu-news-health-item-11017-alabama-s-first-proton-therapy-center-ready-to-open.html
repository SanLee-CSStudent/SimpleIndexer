Proton therapy, a highly sophisticated radiation technology for treating cancer, has come to Alabama with the opening of Proton International at UAB. The facility, begun in the winter of 2018, opened with a ribbon cutting and reception Jan. 13, 2020. The new center is a partnership between the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Proton International. Proton International at UAB is one of only 36 proton therapy centers in the United States and the first in Alabama. \u201CWith the establishment of this center, UAB Medicine has again brought one of the latest, most advanced medical technologies to our region,\u201D said Will Ferniany, Ph.D., CEO of the UAB Health System. \u201CProton therapy will be a valuable tool that our physicians and scientists in the Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine and the O\u2019Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center can employ to the betterment of thousands of cancer patients in Alabama and the surrounding area.\u201D Proton therapy uses an aimed beam of protons directed at the tumor site. The beam is configured to deliver the majority of its energy precisely at the tumor location. Healthy tissue in front of the tumor receives a minimal amount of energy, and tissue behind the tumor receives very little. This reduces the damage to healthy tissue that is common in the use of conventional X-ray radiation and is the cause of most side effects.

Proton therapy is used to treat tumors of the brain and central nervous system, spine, head and neck, lung, prostate, liver, gastrointestinal tract and colon, and some breast tumors. While it treats primarily single-site tumors, in some cases it can be used for treating cancer that has spread, or metastasized, to surrounding tissue because of its focused dose capabilities. \u201CProton therapy will allow us to treat deep-seeded cancers,\u201D said James A. Bonner, M.D., the Merle M. Salter Endowed Professor and chair of the UAB Department of Radiation Oncology. \u201CIt can be particularly efficacious in the treatment of children, who can be highly sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy. We are excited to offer this cutting-edge approach for patients and families in Birmingham, across Alabama and beyond.\u201D Proton International at UAB is on 20th Street South between Fourth and Fifth avenues. The facility consists of a three-story building to house clinical exam rooms, offices and the ProBeam proton therapy system, manufactured by Varian Medical Systems, a longtime partner with UAB in the delivery of radiation therapy. The medical staff, including radiation oncologists, medical physicists, dosimetrists, radiation therapy technologists and nurses, will be exclusively from UAB. The heart of proton therapy is a machine called a cyclotron, which produces the proton beam and delivers it to the precise location in the body to destroy tumor cells. Proton International at UAB\u2019s cyclotron, nick-named Emma, was manufactured in Germany. The $25 million, 90-ton cyclotron was brought by ship to Brunswick, Georgia, then transported to UAB last March by a specialized truck, with 20 axles, 78 wheels, and drivers in front and back. A heavy-lift crane was assembled on Fourth Avenue South to lift and deposit Emma into the facility via the roof. UAB will also be involved in clinical research studies on the use of proton therapy to discover the full utility of the therapy and produce best practice parameters on its use.
