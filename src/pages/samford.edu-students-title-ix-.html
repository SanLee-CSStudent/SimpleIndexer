Common Myths About Sexual Assault Most rapists are strangers Research statistics suggests more than 75% of victims of sexual assaults know their assailant. If victims do not fight back, they were not raped A number of circumstances could result in a victim not fighting back during an assault. In some instances, the assailant may use a drug or the element of fear to prevent the victim from using physical force against the assailant. The simple truth is that intentional sexual contact without consent of the other person constitutes sexual assault, regardless of whether the victim fights back or not. Rape requires the use of a weapon According to the United States Department of Justice, 80% of rapes and sexual assault incidents do not involve a weapon. Men cannot be raped According to national rape statistics, one out of 33 men will be a victim of rape or sexual assault in their lifetime. Perpetrators of rape are arrested and jailed after the assault Research data suggest less than 40% of rapes and sexual assaults are reported. You were sexually assaulted because you were drinking Alcohol is a weapon that some perpetrators use to control their victims and render them helpless. As part of their plan, an assailant may encourage a potential victim to use alcohol, or they may identify a person who is already drunk to victimize. Alcohol is not a cause of rape; it is only one of many tools that perpetrators of rape use to control their victims. When a partner says no, they really mean yes When a person says yes to sex, they are giving consent. Silence does not mean consent, nor does a victim giving in to sex after being subjected to consistent begging or pleading mean consent. Unrelenting pleading or begging for sex is consistent with coercion. If your partner says no or seems unsure, respect that person and their wishes.
