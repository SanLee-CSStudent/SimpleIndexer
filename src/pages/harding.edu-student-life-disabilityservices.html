DSEA Intake Form If you are in need of accommodations due to a documented learning, physical, or psychological disability, it is my desire to make sure that you get the support you need in order to access your whole potential at Harding University. I am the liaison between you and your professors, as needed. My goal is to \u201Clevel the playing-field\u201D for you in your courses, so that you have the opportunity to be successful in your college career. The first step in accessing academic accommodations is to self-identify at the beginning of the semester by coming by Room 226 in the Student Center, or giving me a call at 501-279-4019 to schedule an appointment to fill out the necessary disability paperwork. Next, you will need to provide documentation for your disability from your doctor, psychologist, or high school psychological examiner according to ADA Guidelines in order to justify the accommodations you are requesting. (Reasonable accommodations are based on your documentation.) Then, you will give your professors an accommodation letter that will provide necessary information to help you. (This will only be information about your accommodations, not your documentation.) Documentation is confidential and will be stored in a secure place in the DSEA office. I\u2019m so glad that you are here! It is my goal to support you academically and personally in any way that I can, as well as, refer you to other support programs on campus to assist you in earning your degree.

Therefore, any student with a documented disability condition (e.g. physical, learning, or psychological) who needs to arrange reasonable accommodations, must contact the instructor and the Office of Disability Services and Educational Access at the beginning of each semester. If the diagnosis of the disability occurs during the academic year, the student must self-identify with the Director of Disability Services and Educational Access as soon as possible in order to put academic accommodations in place for the remainder of the semester. The Office of Disability Services and Educational Access is located in Room 226 in the Student Center on the Harding University Searcy campus.
