Summer Is Anything but Quiet You might be tempted to think that summer is a slow-paced time of planning at Huntingdon, and I can tell you unequivocally that is not the case. There are retirements, searches and new hires, people adapting to new jobs, office moves, new spaces under construction, rooms and buildings and new academic programs being readied \u2026 you get the idea. While planning is certainly part of the mix, it is happening at the pace of the academic year. Here are a few of the things happening on campus this summer: Office of Student Development staff offices from the Hut are moving to Jackson Home. The Center for Career and Vocation (CCV) is moving to Jackson Home, second floor. Department of Religion faculty offices are moving from Jackson Home to Flowers Hall. Offices for Leanne Mallory Carroll \u201905 and Sidney Carol Hall Barnhardt \u201919 are moving to Jackson Home second floor. The Hut will be repurposed during the fall semester into a large gathering\/meeting space as it was when the building was first built. Four faculty retirements, increased needs, and other faculty moves have necessitated searches for positions in a number of academic areas, which will conclude either this summer or for the 2023\u20132024 academic year. Summer classes are underway. Summer Session II begins in July. Need a class to catch up, improve your grades, or increase your pace toward graduation? Sign up! As we announced in March, four new majors will begin in the fall: Biochemistry\/Pre-Health; Cell Biology\/Pre-Health; Exercise Science\/Pre-Athletic Training\/Pre-Occupational Therapy; Exercise Science\/Pre-Physical Therapy. New Student Development staff will begin in June, and they\u2019ll jump right into practicing and planning for 2022\u20132023 academic year orientation programming, student life events, recreation and intramurals, and new clubs and organizations. Huntingdon Plan travel-study groups will fly off to Hawaii and Alaska in June. The campus phone system for offices\/personnel is converting to Zoom phones gradually, with implementation beginning this week. During the transition some office phone numbers may be unavailable for a day or part of a day. If you call and don\u2019t reach someone, please try back or reach out by email. A new coach has been announced for women\u2019s lacrosse (see Sports Talk), and announcements are pending for assistant coaches for women\u2019s soccer, women\u2019s wrestling, and track\/cross country. Two Welcomes are Better than One The Office of Admission is planning two Home Sweet Huntingdon sessions for deposited students, June 23 and July 21, 2022. These sessions will allow incoming students and their families to view parts of the campus that may not have been open as we observed COVID precautions during the 2021\u20132022 academic year, and meet faculty, coaches, and staff who can answer all the questions as you plan to begin your college experience. Learn more, choose a session, and find the link to register here: https:\/\/www.huntingdon.edu\/admission-aid\/traditional-admission\/admitted-students\/ The Office of Student Development is planning the real, official, yay-you\u2019re here welcome to the Home We Love So Well (it\u2019s a line from the alma mater, which you\u2019ll know soon, if you\u2019re an incoming student) during Orientation, which will be held August 4\u20137, just before fall term classes begin August 8. More than 60 upper-level students are involved in orientation planning and programming this year, so you\u2019re sure to have new friends and student-led guidance as soon as you arrive in your college home. You\u2019ll hear more about orientation from Dr. Anthony Leigh, senior vice president for student and institutional development and dean of students, coming in June. Check your Huntingdon email! Summer Camps A few spaces remain for two summer camps that occur simultaneously, June 24\u201325. Both camps are overnight experiences. The Huntingdon Leadership Academy is open to rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are discerning God\u2019s call to ministry in their lives. Exploring American Democracy is a camp for rising high school juniors and seniors in which participants will relive the building of the American Constitution, taking on the roles of the country\u2019s founding fathers and debating the issues of the day. Late registrations (past the June 1 deadline) can be accommodated up to the number of spots available in each camp, so contact the appropriate folks asap. In addition, Baseball, Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Basketball, Men\u2019s Soccer, Softball, and Volleyball (Indoor and Beach) are offering summer athletic camps for youth.
