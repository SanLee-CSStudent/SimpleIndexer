Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) Are you a member of the National Guard or the Army Reserve and want to serve as a commissioned officer? If so, the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) is designed for actively drilling reservists or guardsman. Many college students and professionals are soldiers in the Army Reserve or National Guard. In uniform, they contribute to our national security. In their civilian careers, they contribute the skills they have learned and strengthened to reinforce their success. Participants earn pay for monthly drill, and cannot be federally mobilized until completion of their ROTC training and college degree. Those who successfully complete the Army ROTC program can request to become Officers in the Army Reserve or National Guard. This allows them to pursue a career in the private sector of the economy \u2013 while simultaneously serving as an Officer in the defense of our nation. SMP Scholarship Opportunities Eligible students, who wish to serve their military obligation in the National Guard or Army Reserve, may compete for a 2-year, 3-year or 4-years scholarship opportunity. These scholarships can help pay for either full tuition and fees or $10,000 for room and board, and include an annual book stipend of $1,200, a promotion to E-5, and a monthly ROTC stipend of $420.00. SMP Non-Scholarship Opportunities Eligible students, who do not wish to obligate their military career to a Reserve component, may compete to serve Active Duty upon commissioning. This opportunity will include a promotion to E-5 and a monthly ROTC stipend of $420.00.
