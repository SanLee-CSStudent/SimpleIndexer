Click here for more information about the University of Arkansas - Fort Smith's COVID-19 response and FAQs Employees and commuter students who test positive for COVID-19 or who have been contacted by Arkansas Department of Health contact tracers and advised to self-isolate are required to self-isolate off campus until they have been cleared by the Arkansas Department of Health and submitted their isolation release letter to the university. Residential students may self-isolate either in their campus residence under strict isolation protocols or temporarily relocate to a room designated for quarantine purposes. Since the university can only confirm the total number of tests and positivity rates for university-affiliated testing conducted on campus, positive cases that are self-reported or provided by the Arkansas Department of Health in which tests were administered off campus are separated above. UAFS may not be aware of all tests taken by university employees or students. 5210 Grand Avenue | P.O.
