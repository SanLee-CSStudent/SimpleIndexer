About The Program Application deadline is March 1 Radiologic technologists are critical to diagnosing a patient. It is their ability to capture images of the body that can lead to finding the source of an illness or injury. In this program, students are able to work with imaging equipment to take x-rays and even enhance their training with a mannequin with bones. After only 21 months, students in this program will receive an associate of applied science degree and be eligible to take the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists Examination for Radiographers. This examination certifies the applicant as a Registered Technologist, RT (R), ARRT. Prospective students must submit a North Arkansas College application as well as a radiologic technology program application by March 1. Only applicants who have completed or have in progress BIOL 2214 Anatomy & Physiology I, BIOL 2224 Anatomy & Physiology II, and CP 0933, MAT 1011 and MAT 1012 (or a higher level of mathematics) will be considered. Students are required to maintain a minimum grade of \u201CC\u201D in each course required in the entire radiologic technology program curriculum. An overall GPA of 2.0 is required for admission into the program and for graduation. The Radiologic Technology Program has been awarded 8 years accreditation with JRCERT. The maximum duration that may be awarded by JRCERT in this category is 8 years. The radiologic technology program is accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology, 20 N. Wacker Drive, Suite 2850, Chicago, IL 60606-3182.

Faculty Contact Suzanne Woods Radiologic Technology Program Director (870) 391-3319 swoods@northark.edu \u201CI broke my wrist once by tripping over a fence, and I broke my foot by walking off a curb. I thought that X-rays seemed cool. I like bones, and anatomy is easy for me to learn.\u201D - Robert Allen, radiologic technology student Disaster Contingency for Course Delivery In the event of a catastrophic event or pandemic in the state or the area, all Northark in-person classes may be transferred to an online and\/or blended environment in order to keep students, faculty, and staff safe and healthy. Students will be notified of this change via email and\/or text message within 72 hours if possible. It is important that students and faculty notify the department if contact information should change. In the event of a power outage, communication will resume as soon as possible. Instructors will also send messages to students via email and\/or the learning management system detailing any changes to the class and the delivery method. In the event of this change, students will need to have reliable access to both the internet and a computer to complete the coursework. Should a student not have the needed equipment to complete online assignments, they should notify their instructor and visit the Learning Resource Center to familiarize themselves with the procedures in checking out needed equipment. Course-Specific Contingencies All classes will be virtual if the situation arises. Students will be required to attend online until classes resume at Northark. All faculty will maintain FERPA in a virtual environment. Clinical will continue as scheduled if allowed. In the case that clinical sites are shut down due to a catastrophic event, students will attend clinical simulation online with the clinical coordinator. All clinical sites and instructors will be notified via email of this change. Additional instructions will be given as needed. Program Goals and Learning Outcomes Goal: Students will be clinically competent when performing entry-level radiographic examinations. Outcome: 1A) Students will demonstrate proper patient positioning skills. This will be measured by monthly clinical evaluations and a final lab evaluation. Outcome: 1B) Students will utilize safe radiation protection methods when using ionizing radiation. This will be measured by Section 7 of the monthly clinical evaluation and Section 6 of the final lab evaluation. Goal: Students will communicate effectively with patients and members of the health care team. Outcome: 2A) Students will demonstrate effective written communication skills. This will be measured by hospital inspection reports and contrast media reports. Outcome: 2B) Students will demonstrate effective oral communication skills. This will be measured by final presentations and special procedure presentations. Goal: Students will use critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. Outcome: 3A) Students will adjust positioning and procedure protocol for trauma patients (non-routine). This will be measured by lab evaluation of trauma hip exam and lab evaluation of trauma cervical spine exam. Outcome: 3B) Students will accurately evaluate radiographic images for optimal quality. This will be measured by the image evaluation section of final exam and the final exam. Goal: Students will model professionalism. Outcome: 4A) Students will demonstrate professional responsibility in the working environment. This will be measured by a weekly clinical checklist. Outcome: 4B) Students will determine the importance of continued professional development. This will be measured by a career development plan. Goal: The program will provide the community with professional and competent entry-level radiologic technologists. Outcome: 5A) Students will complete the program and graduate within 2 years. This will be measured by the graduation rate. Outcome: 5B) Students will be satisfied with their experience. This will be measured by a graduate survey. Outcome: 5C) Graduates will pass the ARRT Radiography Certification on the first attempt. This will be measured by the Registry Examination Summary Report. Outcome: 5D) Graduates pursuing employment will be gainfully employed within 12 months of graduation. This will be measured by the job placement rate. Outcome: 5E) Employers will be satisfied with graduate performance. This will be measured by the employer survey rate. Licensure and Certification Graduates of the Associate of Applied Science Degree in Radiologic Technology can apply for licensure in Arkansas. According to the ASRT website, the state of Missouri does not require a state license at this time. We are unsure of licensure requirements in other states.
