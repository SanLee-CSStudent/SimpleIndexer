Crime Prevention Programs The Central Arizona College Police Department believes that it is better to act early to prevent crime rather than react to it after it has been committed. Ultimately, we are all responsible for our own safety\/security and the safety\/security of those around us. Members of the CAC community are encouraged to participate in and be aware of the crime prevention programs that are available to them. The following is a list of crime prevention programs and services that are offered to the community: Police Department Escort Program. The Police Department Escort Program provides a personal escort for CAC students, faculty, and staff who are concerned about their safety. The program offers a walking escort from one location to another on the Signal Peak Campus from dusk to dawn, seven days a week. The escort is generally provided by a Campus Police Officer in a college vehicle. However, the escort may also be provided by a trained, radio-equipped student employee. To request an escort, call 520-836-9655 when you need the escort (advanced reservations are not accepted). Crime Prevention Presentations. Members of the Police Department are available to talk to any student or employee group on any of our campuses. These talks are designed to educate members of the campus communities about security and safety issues, and various techniques that can be used to prevent crime on campus. Rape Awareness, Education, and Prevention. In cooperation with the Office of the Dean of Students, rape awareness, education, and prevention presentations are available to members of the campus community. Facility Surveys. Comprehensive safety and security surveys of campus buildings and grounds are conducted at each campus by the Police Department. Motorist Assist Program. The Motorist Assist Program is a 24-hour service that provides jump-start services to people on campus. Found Property Program. The Police Department is designated as the official campus location for receiving and storing found property. Each year, the Police Department logs and stores property found by community members and attempts to locate the owner and return it. Property may also be taken for safekeeping by Department personnel if the owner is unable to or unavailable to secure it. If the property goes unclaimed for more than 90 days, the owner, if known, is contacted via mail and asked to pick the property up. If the owner fails to pick up their property it is turned over to the College Surplus Property Office for disposition. The Property and Evidence Section, which includes lost and found property, is open to the public from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday and closed during state-observed holidays. If you would like more information about any of the above crime prevention programs and services, please contact the Police Department at 520-494-5445, during regular business hours. Silent Witness Program Perhaps you\u2019ve witnessed a crime on campus, or you have some pertinent information about a crime or incident that could be helpful to campus police, or another law enforcement agency. We understand the apprehension about reporting crimes or incidents face-to-face with police, so we have instituted the Silent Witness Program. The Central Arizona College Police Department Silent Witness program provides a means of communication for members of the college community to anonymously provide us with information on unsolved crimes, crimes in progress, wanted fugitives, or any possible threat to the safety of our college community. If you have information you believe may help police solve a crime, please call (520) 494-5011. You do not need to leave your name, only the information you would like to provide. Leave a call-back telephone number only if you want the police to call you. You may also email cacpolice@centralaz.edu. Thank You for helping make Central Arizona College a safe place for all.
