Our entire campus community is thrilled to be welcoming you to the Charger Family. In order to be fully prepared for the exciting things this next semester has in store for you, we ask that every freshman student entering for summer or fall 2022 register and complete our New Student Orientation program. New Student Orientation Once students register for New Student Orientation, they will be added to an online pre-orientation course called Charger Building Blocks. This course can be completed before your Orientation session to provide guidance on academic advising and class registration. It will also go over the checklist of items you need to complete as you prepare to become a Charger! Orientation will begin first thing in the morning on Day One and will conclude by 1:30 pm on Day Two. Please note that students will be spending the night on campus on Day One of Orientation. Accommodation options available in the Huntsville area for parents\/guests can be found HERE.

REGISTER FOR AUGUST 10 & 11 Freshman Orientation FAQs Is Orientation required? It is highly encouraged that all new-first time students attend an Orientation session, as it is a helpful agent as you navigate the transition from high school to college! All new-students regardless of attendance, will be charged an Orientation fee. Do I have to spend the night on campus? No, spending the night is not required, but we highly suggest it! We have a lot of fun activities planned throughout the evening, and it\u2019s a great opportunity to spend as much time as possible with your new classmates! Choosing to not spend the night does not change the rate of the Orientation fee. What is the Orientation fee and what does that include? Each new student will be assessed a flat rate fee of $225 that will be added to your student account. This fee includes meals, materials, and housing for the student, and meals and materials for up to two guests. Additional guests over the age of eight will require an additional fee of $50, which will be charged to the student account. Should my parents or siblings come? We definitely encourage parents to attend! There is separate programming for parents and guests during the Orientation session. Parent, guests, and siblings must make separate accommodation plans as only students will stay on campus. You can find more information about local accommodations here. What do I need to pack? If you are planning to spend the night on campus, you will need to bring a sleeping bag\/blanket, pillow, and bath towel, hand towel and\/or washcloth. We also suggest bringing phone chargers, possibly a small fan, and anything else that you need to be comfortable! What should I wear? One thing is for sure\u2026it will be hot! We recommend dressing comfortably and bringing a light jacket in case any of the indoor spaces are chilly or the temperature drops in the evening. You\u2019ll be doing a lot of walking, so make sure to wear comfortable shoes and check the weather to ensure you\u2019re prepared! What if I have dietary or mobility restrictions?
