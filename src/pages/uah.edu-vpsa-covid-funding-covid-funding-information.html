CARES Act FAQs UAH acknowledges that it signed and returned the federal Certification and Agreement to receive CARES Act funding on May 11, 2020 and agreed to use no less than 50% of the funds received under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act to provide Emergency Financial Grants to students. What is the CARES\/Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund provided by the federal government? The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed by Congress and signed into law to provide economic relief from COVID-19. One section of the CARES Act established the Higher Education Emergency Relief fund and sent money to schools to use for emergency financial aid grants to students for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the pandemic. When will CARES\/Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds be available? UAH applied for funding from the federal CARES Act and once we receive that funding from the U.S. Department of Education, we will be able to rapidly start distributing grants to students based on their Estimated Family Contribution. These grants will be disbursed as soon as possible. Recipients will be notified via a message to their UAH email account. Who is eligible for the CARES\/Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds? Students who meet basic eligibility criteria for federal financial aid and who have an EFC between zero (0) and 19,999 have been considered for these funds. The Financial Aid and Scholarship Committee will use Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) data to determine your eligibility. Under U.S. Department of Education rules for the program, these funds can be awarded to undergraduate and graduate students pursuing degree programs and enrolled at the UAH. The student must have been enrolled Spring 2020. Unfortunately, the U.S. Department of Education does not allow these funds to be used for international students, undocumented students, non-matriculated students or students enrolled in distance-only degree programs or courses. Why didn\u2019t I receive a UAH CARES Act Relief Grant? Students who were not eligible to due a lack of processed, eligible EFC or the EFC was too high to be considered will not be awarded in the first disbursement. A subsequent disbursement may be possible depending upon the first distribution of funding for requests and valid submissions. Previous Awards: 3090 students were identified as eligible and offered an opportunity to apply. Subsequent offers made to 378 student employees and 61 residential students 2300+ students have applied. 1475 students have been awarded. $843,799 funding awarded.
