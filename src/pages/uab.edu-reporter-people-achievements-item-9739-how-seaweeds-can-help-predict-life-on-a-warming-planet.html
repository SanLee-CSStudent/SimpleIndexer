Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield There\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t see when you look at seaweeds. Those billowing wads of slightly icky algae brushing by your legs on a rough day at the beach, or the indistinguishable, ribbon-like groups stuck to rocks on a murky river bottom, are actually a mass of individuals with fascinating histories and unorthodox sex lives. Take the red seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla. Its native range is the along the coastlines of China, Japan and Russia. But decades ago, most likely beginning in Matsushima Bay, some 200 miles northeast of Tokyo, Gracilaria got wrapped up in the international oyster trade. Today, you can find this seaweed in estuaries from Chusini Cove, Alaska, to Baja California on the Pacific coast of North America, from Georgia to New Hampshire, and Morocco to Scandinavia. We know these details mainly through the field work and genetic sleuthing of UAB\u2019s globe-trotting seaweed expert Stacy Krueger-Hadfield, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Biology. As a post-doc and here at UAB, Krueger-Hadfield has tracked Gracilaria from Japan to the United States and Europe \u2014 mostly on the water, but sometimes collecting samples from museum archives. Along the way, she has documented how these successful invasions have \u201Ctorn up the life cycle\u201D of Gracilaria \u2014 and created an unparalleled opportunity. Gracilaria vermiculophylla in a tide pool in Shinori, Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan. Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield You may not think much about seaweed sex, but the National Science Foundation has. Gracilaria is what Krueger-Hadfield describes as an \u201Cecosystem engineer,\u201D capable of creating, modifying and maintaining habitats for crabs, snails and other creatures, with outsized effects \u2014 good, neutral and bad \u2014 on surrounding life. Our climate is changing, and the habits and choices of successful invading species such as Gracilaria offer crucial clues to the future of life on Earth. In January, Krueger-Hadfield received a five-year, $1 million-plus NSF CAREER award that will expand her work. CAREER awards are designed for early-career faculty with the potential to be academic role models in both research and education. Krueger-Hadfield\u2019s project will give UAB graduate and undergraduate students the opportunity to take part in her research \u2014 and contribute new knowledge about the freshwater red algae in Alabama\u2019s rivers and streams. Krueger-Hadfield sampling in Hokkaido, Japan. Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield Tracking an invasion through history Macroalgae, like humans, roses and all other eukaryotes \u2014 everything but viruses, bacteria and archaea \u2014 have a multi-stage life cycle. In one stage, their DNA is contained in one chromosome (haploid), and in another, it is in two chromosomes (diploid). For humans and other mammals, the haploid stage is short-lived and consists of eggs and sperm. Once they meet to form an embryo, the rest of the life cycle is diploid. Gracilaria vermiculophylla on a mudflat in Soukanzan near Matsushima Bay in Japan \u2013 a likely source region of the invasion of the Northern Hemisphere. Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield Register for CAREER Award training April 15 Cheng-Chien Chen, Ph.D., and Wenli Bi, Ph.D., both of the Department of Physics, and Gayan Wijeratne, Ph.D., Department of Chemistry, will lead a campuswide training for junior faculty planning to apply for an NSF CAREER Award. Two sessions will be held online, on April 15 and April 22; the second session builds on the first, so attendance at both sessions is recommended. Register by April 8. For Gracilaria, and many of the other macroalgae Krueger-Hadfield studies, the situation is more complicated: Their haploid sperm and egg equivalents live long lives and are incredibly hard to distinguish from the diploid individuals without a microscope. \u201CIt\u2019s like a human egg and sperm grow up and become complete and complex adults before they make a sperm and an egg,\u201D Krueger-Hadfield said. The cycle begins when male Gracilaria individuals known as gametophytes release sperm that cannot swim and instead float off in hopes of encountering and fertilizing the eggs that stay on the female gametophytes. Success results in the female gametophyte nurturing the resulting zygote before releasing thousands of spores, each of which can grow into a separate sporophyte, neither male nor female, with a mixture of genes from both parents. After it grows into an adult, the sporophyte produces a group of four spores that develop into four separate gametophytes, two male and two female. These grab a spot on the sea floor and the cycle starts over. A female gametophyte fixed to shell hash at Ape Hole Creek, a site near Crisfield, Maryland. The sampling trip to the mid-Atlantic in 2014 helped solve some of the riddles of this invasion and laid the foundation for work the Krueger-Hadfield lab began in 2017 along the Delmarva. Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield That is how it works in many of the populations in Gracilaria\u2019s native range, that is. But everything changed around the time of the Second World War, when Japanese oysters were introduced and cultivated in the United States. Through field samples collected in the northwest Pacific, North America and Europe, and by studying so-called \u201Cgray literature\u201D \u2014 government and media reports, mainly \u2014 as a post-doc, Krueger-Hadfield and colleagues constructed a timeline and a hypothesis of how Gracilaria invaded. Japanese oystermen would wrap their oysters in seaweed for shipment, she says, and workers on the receiving end most likely dumped this equivalent of packing peanuts over the side of the transporting ships into local waters. (Similar events probably happened in Virginia, introducing Gracilaria to the U.S. East Coast.) Krueger-Hadfield has also examined samples of pressed algae in museum collections to track the spread of Gracilaria. \u201CPeople have been pressing algae since Victorian times,\u201D she said. \u201CIt was one of the few acceptable pastimes for genteel ladies.\u201D Krueger-Hadfield sampling in northwestern France. She got stuck up to her waist in mud and required about 45 minutes to extricate herself, she recalls. Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield Seaweed sleuthing through sequencing Using a type of genetic sequencing, or genotyping, techniques she learned as a doctoral student in France, Krueger-Hadfield can make precise identifications of where a particular seaweed likely came from as well as what stage it is. \u201CIn essence, we use the same tools and analyses that commercial companies like 23andme use to determine a person\u2019s ancestry,\u201D she said. \u201CWe are just trying to figure out an alga\u2019s ancestry.\u201D Krueger-Hadfield\u2019s DNA analysis, which tracks variations in microsatellite regions and single nucleotide polymorphisms, traced the likely source of the invasion to a specific location in Japan, Matsushima Bay. \u201CHaving knowledge of the source of an invasion provides a very powerful context with which to test questions about the evolutionary ecology of biological invasions,\u201D Krueger-Hadfield said. \u201CWe now possess a large body of work on this particular alga, both from my post-doctoral work and from data we\u2019ve generated in the lab here at UAB, enabling us to address the main theme of the CAREER award: the convergence of life cycle questions (why does one stage dominate after perturbations?) and reproductive system questions (what are the effects of self-fertilization, outcrossing and asexuality in a population?).\u201D A non-native Gracilaria vermiculophylla population at Strawberry in Marin County, California. This site was sampled in Krueger-Hadfield et al. 2018 \u2013 a sampling effort from the Krueger-Hadfield lab at UAB that helped reshape how we were thinking about the ecology of this invasion. Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield An invasion\u2019s long-lasting effects \u201CHumbling, exciting and a huge relief\u201D Being selected for a CAREER award \u201Cwas humbling, exciting and a huge relief all at once,\u201D Krueger-Hadfield said. \u201CThis award is the culmination of many years of hard work, but would not have been possible without a fantastic team composed of colleagues right here in Alabama and further afield in Virginia, Japan, Germany and France. I\u2019m not sure I have fully wrapped my head around the honor, but I am incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to explore these questions with my collaborators.\u201D Once Gracilaria was introduced in North America and Europe, it began to take hold and reproduce. But not, as at home, always clinging to pebbles and shells through grippy attachments known as holdfasts. Many of the temperate, salty estuaries where Gracilaria invaded have soft-sediment bottoms, so they float freely on top of the mud and silt. Their life cycle and reproductive habits have changed as well. Gracilaria is what is known as partially clonal, engaging in both sexual and asexual reproduction. In tough times, Gracilaria can break off pieces of itself that will float away and grow indefinitely (vegetative reproduction), although they lack holdfasts. Evidence amassed by Krueger-Hadfield and others, including the lopsided ratio of diploid to haploid individuals collected at invasive sites, points to an increase in this type of asexual reproduction. In the soft-sediment sites where she finds Gracilaria in North America and Europe, \u201Cthe gametophytes get eliminated,\u201D Krueger-Hadfield said. \u201CIf we can figure out why, this gives us insight into how these different stages that look the same are not in fact the same \u2014 this will provide us with some predictive tools to expand to other seaweeds, both native and invasive, that are what has been termed \u2018isomorphic.\u2019\u201D Many eukaryotes are partially clonal, including parasites that are relevant to human disease, Krueger-Hadfield says. \u201CUnderstanding the effects of these different ways of reproducing can have broad applications.\u201D A non-native Gracilaria vermiculophylla population at Bolinas Lagoon near Stinson Beach, California. This site also was sampled in Krueger-Hadfield et al. 2018. Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield Predicting response to future conditions The differences may be due to different salinity and temperature combinations among habitats. Krueger-Hadfield will collect samples from Gracilaria\u2019s native and introduced ranges and test their responses to changing salinity and temperature at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science Eastern Shore Laboratory, where she has worked since 2014. \u201CIt\u2019s a fantastic lab space with vessels and running seawater,\u201D she said. \u201CImportantly, it\u2019s also full of great people who enrich our field work and without whom we wouldn\u2019t have generated the datasets needed to compose a cogent and competitive proposal for the CAREER award.\u201D It is not just haploid vs diploid; in previous work with a separate alga, Krueger-Hadfield and collaborators showed that changes in pH levels had stronger effects on sporophytes than on gametophytes. \u201CThat suggests that life cycle stages are not the same,\u201D she said. \u201CWe don\u2019t know, however, if one stage will be the weakest link under future conditions.\u201D The CAREER award \u201Cwill allow us to build a set of phenotyping assays that can be broadly applied to other organisms with this life cycle type,\u201D Krueger-Hadfield said. \u201CThus, we would be able to predict how all stages of a life cycle might respond to future conditions. In an age of unprecedented biodiversity loss, these types of data, all based on a firm foundation of natural history, are critical.\u201D Tufts of the freshwater red alga Paralemanea near the Easley Covered Bridge near Oneonta, Alabama. Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield Student adventures in \u201Ctheir own backyard\u201D The CAREER award also will give Krueger-Hadfield funding to bring UAB students with her to the VIMS Eastern Shore Laboratory to join in her research and contribute to related research on freshwater algae in Alabama. The Department of Biology already offers tremendous faculty-led study-abroad opportunities for marine science in the Galapagos, the Bahamas and Costa Rica, Krueger-Hadfield noted; but \u201Cnot everyone has the resources to take advantage of that.\u201D The NSF support will give \u201Cstudents an opportunity to get out into their own backyard, as well as a chance to go to a place in the Virginia shore that is a very different habitat to what they may have seen in Gulf Shores, and do real, fun science. That gives them a chance to awaken something they may want to pursue as a career.\u201D Krueger-Hadfield also will offer this new summer Maymester course in 2023, tentatively titled Forensic Phycology, that will give undergraduate biology students the chance to \u201Ccontribute to these data and work in Alabama streams,\u201D she said.

Image courtesy Stacy Krueger-Hadfield The award also will fund innovative research into the ecology and evolution of freshwater red algae in Alabama streams. \u201CThe CAREER award will allow us to generate baseline biodiversity data on these algae and work with citizen-science volunteers in the Alabama Water Watch,\u201D Krueger-Hadfield said. Her doctoral student, Sarah Shainker-Connelly, has grants from the NSF\u2019s Graduate Research Fellowships Program and the British Phycological Society \u201Cto pilot these citizen-science efforts,\u201D Krueger-Hadfield said. \u201CIf we have water-quality monitors out and about, they can cover much more water than we can alone.\u201D Published in Achievements back to top Achievements Neuroengineering Ph.D. program graduates first student Inspired by a family diagnosis and a viral video, Adeel Memon, M.D., Ph.D., is exploring the possibilities of brain-computer interfaces to treat Parkinson\u2019s and other neurological conditions. posted a while back 1241 views Achievements How seaweeds can help predict life on a warming planet With a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation and innovative genetic techniques, UAB algal expert Stacy Krueger-Hadfield, Ph.D., is uncovering clues to the success of a coastal ecosystem engineer. posted a while back 1436 views Achievements Searching for the holy grail of room-temperature superconductors with seriously big data and supercomputing With a prestigious NSF CAREER grant, physicist Cheng-Chien Chen, Ph.D., is working on a problem that could lead to a new generation of electronics \u2014 and giving UAB students a front-row seat to the action. posted a while back 1568 views Achievements Chen recognized by Association for Computing Machinery for \u2018outstanding scientific contributions to computing\u2019 Jake Chen, Ph.D., associate director of the Informatics Institute, is the first ACM member in Alabama to be honored as a Distinguished Member in this category. posted a while back 1704 views Achievements Overlooked enzyme intermediates, students are focus of new NSF CAREER award Gayan Wijeratne, Ph.D., assistant professor of chemistry, is studying versatile molecules with heme iron centers that could be useful in new cancer therapies and greener, cheaper fuel cells.
