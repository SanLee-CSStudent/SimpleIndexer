The North Arkansas College truck driving program has new options for students thanks to a donation from FedEx Freight. FedEx Freight donated a 2007 Volvo automatic transmission semi to Northark\u2019s program, which until this latest donation only had manual transmission trucks in its fleet. \u201CFedEx Freight is proud to provide this donation and support Northark\u2019s program to train the next generation of drivers,\u201D said Josh Marshall, manager of transportation for FedEx Freight. \u201CWe\u2019re not only investing in their education but also future careers, and believe this contribution is one way we can increase people\u2019s interest in joining the trucking profession.\u201D Northark Truck Driving Instructor Charlie Duggan said the donation is important because some students are hesitant to sign up for the truck driving program because they do not know how to drive a truck with a manual transmission. \u201CThis opens up another avenue for people that are intimidated by the 10-speed,\u201D he said. Duggan added students will be able to train on the automatic truck while also learning how to use a standard truck. Northark Technical Center Director Scott Howie said if a student can\u2019t competently drive a standard truck, he or she can still get a commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) with an automatic restriction. \u201CThis allows students that aren\u2019t comfortable with signing up for the program because they have never driven standard trucks and gives them the ability to sign up for the program,\u201D he said. Duggan said the need was identified after an advisory council meeting with area businesses. The council suggests ways to improve programs that lead to students having successful careers once they graduate. The council noted the need for an automatic truck and FedEx Freight stepped in to help. Duggan noted there are a lot of automatic trucks on the roads. \u201CThe industry is going the way of automatics because the technology has improved,\u201D he said. \u201CA lot of sizeable companies are going to all automatics.\u201D Northark\u2019s trucking program consists of five weeks of classroom and training time and 10 weeks of an internship with area trucking companies. Duggan said once a student graduates and gets a job driving, he or she could earn a salary of $50,000 to $70,000 per year depending on how much travel is involved.
