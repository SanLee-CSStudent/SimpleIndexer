Below you will learn about specific situations and the steps you should take. Dropping Below 6 Credits If you borrowed federal student loans while at CAC and have dropped below 6 credits, your loans have entered their grace period (assuming you have not gone into repayment before). This means you have 6 months before you begin making payments on your student loan(s) obligation. If you previously used your grace period, you will immediately go into repayment. As a borrower, you are required to complete the online Direct Loan Exit Counseling if you drop below 6 credits, graduate, or leave school. Exit counseling provides important information to prepare you to repay your federal student loan(s). Log in to Federal Student Aid using your FSA ID to begin your Exit Counseling session. Your student loan obligation is very important and how you manage it will help you to determine your future financial success. We recommend contacting your loan servicer and setting up your online account as soon as possible. For additional information, check out these sections: Repaying Student Loans and Avoiding Default.
