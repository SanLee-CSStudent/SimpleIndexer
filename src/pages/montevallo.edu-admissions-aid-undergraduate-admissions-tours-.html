Our beautiful, historic campus and vibrant campus community makes touring a memorable experience for you and your family! During a Montevallo campus tour, you will have the opportunity to explore our beautiful campus and interact with our fabulous student tour guides. You will also have the opportunity to meet your Admissions Counselor who will be your guide through the admissions process. They are a fantastic resource to discuss financial aid, scholarships, and all details to make your transition to the University of Montevallo a seamless success! Campus visits are offered every Monday through Friday at 10:00am and 2:00pm. Virtual tours and information sessions, along with self-guided tours are also available. Preview Days are also offered in person during the fall, spring, and summer. Please use the links below to schedule a weekday campus visit, virtual tour or Preview Day. Please arrive no later than 10 minutes prior to your scheduled start time to allow for parking, check-in, and to go to the restroom, if needed. On the day of your tour, be sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes as most of the tour requires walking. Individuals needing disability-related accommodations during campus visits should contact the Admissions Office as early as possible. Efforts will be made to accommodate all access requests regardless of timing, but the University cannot guarantee that requests made with less than one week\u2019s notice can be met. The Admissions Office is located in Reynolds Hall, which is the only white brick building on campus. Campus tour parking will be in front of Reynolds Hall.
