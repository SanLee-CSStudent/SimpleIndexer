Reopening Information for Faculty and Staff Tuskegee University continues to monitor conditions surrounding the pandemic, the spread of the omicron variant, and the pandemic's effects on the reopening of classes for the spring term. --- PLEASE SEE LINKS TO THE LATEST UPDATES --- Reopening Information for Faculty and Staff The policies and procedures outlined in the COVID-19 Policies and Procedures manual are necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure meeting our collective safety and health goals. As such, each member of the TU community has a critical role to play in the fight against the spread of the virus. Our success depends on every person adhering to the best practices as outlined in, including wearing masks and other protective equipment, practicing physical distancing, washing hands frequently, and so on. As everyone is expected to take responsibility for their own health, we also expect you to be considerate of the safety of others -- together we can succeed in keeping everyone safe and healthy.

Safe Return to Classrooms Statement Regarding Suspension of Fall Sports University Preparedness and Response Virtual Academic Support Resources Fall 2020 FAQs Academics Course Registration Employees' Return to Campus Enrollment Facilities and Campus-wide Health & Safety Financial Aid, Tuition and Fees On-Campus Residency Student Programs and Support Services General Campus Spaces Anyone in a Tuskegee University space (including buildings, grounds, shared laboratory areas, conference rooms, elevators, parking structures, shuttles, etc.) must wear a face covering or a mask that covers both the nose and mouth at all times, except when alone in a private room or vehicle. Residents in campus housing are not required to wear a face covering while in their own units or rooms, but face coverings must be worn in all common areas of Tuskegee University housing, buildings, and other campus facilities. Campus Laboratories & Personal Protective Equipment Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an important factor in your safety when working in laboratories. Gloves, safety glasses and lab coats must be worn as part of lab safety equipment and established experimental protocols. It is expected that anyone who enters a campus laboratory will wear the required personal protective equipment. (See the Guidelines for Laboratories & Research Spaces on page 15 for more guidance.) Hand Washing\/Hygiene All students and personnel must practice good hygiene by frequently washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or longer. Hand sanitizer is available in building lobbies and other frequented locations. When possible, use soap and water instead of hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your face and hair. If you need to cough or sneeze, please use a tissue or cough inside your elbow. Failure to Comply Students: First failure to comply with the Personal Protective Equipment Policy will result in a warning. Repeated violations of this policy will result in suspension from campus and laboratories. If a laboratorian is suspended, for those with required laboratory experiments, arrangements must be made with the Dean of the respective department or school\/college to ensure animals are cared for and\/or someone takes suspended persons\u2019 place. Students can report violations of this policy to the Office of the Dean of Students. Students may also use the student complaint form: https:\/\/www.tuskegee.edu\/student-complaints. Faculty and Staff: First failure to comply with the Personal Protective Equipment Policy will result in a warning and the employee being sent home if appropriate PPE is not immediately available. Additional disciplinary actions will follow the progressive discipline policy outlined in the appropriate handbook. Faculty and staff can report violations of this policy to the unit\u2019s immediate supervisor; the supervisor will notify Human Resources of the violation. We will attempt to preserve confidentiality to the extent possible. Contractors & Other Visitors to Campus: Failure to comply with the Personal Protective Equipment Policy will result in a warning and the contractor\/visitor being asked to leave campus if appropriate PPE is not immediately available.
