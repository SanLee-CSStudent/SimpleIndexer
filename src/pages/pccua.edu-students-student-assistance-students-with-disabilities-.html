PCCUA tries to provide services which make learning and success with life goals a reality. Philosophy PCCUA welcomes students with disabilities. As an open enrollment college, PCCUA strives to meet the needs of students with self-disclosed disabilities who wish to advance their education. Students with disclosed disabilities who work with a Disability Coordinator to obtain reasonable accommodations are more likely to experience success in a positive learning environment. Legal Policy PCCUA accommodates students with disabilities as required by the American Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act Section 504 (173). A Disability Coordinator is available on each campus to assist students in obtaining reasonable accommodations for self-disclosed disabilities. Disability Coordinators are identified in the PCCUA College Catalog and Student Handbook. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to self-disclose the disability to the Disability Coordinator. Definition The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, included Section 504, forbade discrimination against persons with disabilities by programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance, which included virtually every institution of higher education, except the U.S. military academies and a few small religious schools. A postsecondary institution must make reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities so that they can participate in programs and activities. Colleges must make \"academic accommodations\" for students with disabilities so that they can participate in the academic and extra curriculum at the institution. Academic accommodations include extended time for test taking or completion of course work, tape recording of classes, substitution of specific courses to meet degree requirements, modification of test taking, and other adjustments. Colleges do not have to provide accommodations that would \"fundamentally alter\" the educational program or academic requirements essential to a program of study or necessary to fulfill licensing requirements. http:\/\/www.ed.gov\/about\/offices\/list\/osers\/osep\/index.html The rights of students with disabilities are protected under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 (IDEA), and the Disabilities Education Act of 1997, Public Law 105017. Confidentiality Information in the student\u2019s disability file is confidential. Information pertaining to the student\u2019s disability will be maintained in a sealed envelope in the student\u2019s permanent academic record. Information about the existence and relevant limitations of a disability as well as the accommodation for which a student is eligible will be disclosed only with the student\u2019s written permission. The student must provide written permission for disclosure to secure academic and support services (parking, library usage). Appeal A student may appeal a decision concerning accommodation by first requesting an informal meeting with a Disability Coordinator, the Vice Chancellor for Instruction, and instructor if applicable. If the issue is not resolved, the student may activate the formal grievance process as outlined in the PCCUA Policy and Procedure Manual. Faculty Responsibilities The faculty is required to comply with federal and state laws requiring reasonable services to students with disabilities. Therefore, the faculty will: Comply with reasonable accommodations Identify additional accommodations which may facilitate student learning Inform the student's advisor of high-risk student behaviors Maintain confidentiality of the student\u2019s disability Student disabilities documents are kept in the Disabilities Coordinator's Office, and a sealed copy of the documents are placed in the student's official file in the Registrar's Office.
