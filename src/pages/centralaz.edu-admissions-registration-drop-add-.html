Adding Classes Students may add classes via the web or by filling out a Drop\/Add or Withdrawal Form, and submitting the form to the Records and Registration Office for processing. Students will only be permitted to register for a class that has not already met. Dropping Classes During the first week of the semester, students may drop a class that they no longer want to attend via the web or by completing a add\/drop form and submitting it to the Records and Registration Office for processing. When the transaction is processed during the add\/drop week there will be no record of the class on the college transcript. It is the students responsibility to drop the course if they no longer want to attend or the student will be responsible for tuition and fees. Waitlisted Classes Students may place themselves on the waitlist for a full class, and in the event a space becomes available, the student will automatically receive notification, through online services, informing you that a seat is being saved on your behalf. At that point, the student will have exactly 24 hours to register for that class. If the registration is not completed in the allotted time period, the seat is forfeited and the next waitlisted student is notified.

During this period a student may withdraw regardless of reason and must initiate and complete the withdrawal request through the registration office. Instructor permission is not needed. During the final one-third of the course, if there are extenuating circumstances, a student can request an official withdrawal. The approval of both the instructor and division chair or program director will be required. Open Entry\/Open Exit Courses: Students can request an official withdrawal based two-thirds of the days between the date of the registration and the last day of the semester.
