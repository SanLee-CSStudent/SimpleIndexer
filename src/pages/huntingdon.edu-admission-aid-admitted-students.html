FAQ \u2013 Deposited Students Q: How do I register for classes? A: New freshmen and transfer students are placed in classes for the first semester by the Office of Academic Affairs. After you receive your schedule you may make changes during a designated time period, if necessary. Q: What if I don\u2019t know what I want to major in? A: Don\u2019t worry! Exploring and finding new paths for your life are what a liberal arts education is all about. If you don\u2019t declare a major, you will begin as an \u201Cundeclared\u201D student. There are selected advisers who work with students who haven\u2019t yet declared a major. They will work with you to choose a major that suits your interests, goals, and talents. Q: How are roommates selected? A: Roommates are selected on the basis of your responses to the roommate questionnaire in the housing forms you complete. Q: What if I have a friend with whom I\u2019d like to share a room? A: If you and a friend have chosen to room together, you must both indicate that you would like to room with each other on your respective housing forms. Freshmen live with freshmen. Q: When will I find out who my roommate is? A: Roommates are selected by the Office of Residential Communities and communicated to students toward the end of summer. After you receive notification, you should be in touch with your roommate in order to coordinate what you will bring to the room, as well as the d?cor (if that matters to you). Q: When will I know what room I\u2019m in? A: Your room assignment accompanies the information about your roommate. You can learn about room dimensions and more about the halls under the Campus Life\/Residence Life section of the website. Q: Can commuter students purchase meals in the Dining Hall? A: Yes. Your Commuter Fee covers a basic Commuter Meal Plan, providing flex dollars for you to use in various campus dining venues. If you would like to add to your Commuter Meal Plan, consult the Miscellaneous Purchases section of the Student Financial Services information. Q: When will I get my books? A: For incoming freshmen and transfer students from 2016 forward, books and information resources are included within the cost of your student fee. Your books and information resources will be handed out during Big Red Weekend. Q: What should I bring to the residence hall\u2014and what am I not allowed to bring? A: We put together a fairly comprehensive list of what you can pack for college under the Residence Life section of the website, but each student will bring items that suit her or his interests and needs. Q: Is there special parking for students\u2014and is a permit required? A: Yes to both questions. Parking regulations are controlled by Campus Security. Previous Next Enrollment Forms Questions?
