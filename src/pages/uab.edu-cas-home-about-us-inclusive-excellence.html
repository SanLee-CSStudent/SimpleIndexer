Like many others in my role, I typically respond with talking about the important goals related to the retention and graduation of our students, the role of community engagement to serve our state and develop the career readiness of our students, as well as supporting the critical research and scholarship of our faculty. For me, accomplishing those goals means that our overarching goal must be to become a model of Inclusive Excellence. I have spent almost 30 years as a professor of industrial\/organizational psychology engaging in research and developing practices to support a variety of organizations in achieving their diversity-related goals. These organizations understood that given the complexity of the world today, we cannot truly be excellent without recruiting, retaining, and developing diverse talent. Diversity in our classrooms, laboratories, and studios helps us to be more transparent in our communication and motivates us to challenge our assumptions rather than rely on tacit knowledge and group-think that can derail and impair our decision making. Diversity also broadens the experiences, perspectives, and skills we use to analyze and solve our most pressing problems by expanding our tool kits. A diversity of talent helps us make better decisions that reflect and serve the richness of our community. Yet none of these benefits can be realized without a culture of inclusion. It is critical that our diverse college of students, faculty, and staff have an opportunity to be excellent in their roles by making sure that we have a culture of Inclusive Excellence; that is, that each member of the College of Arts and Sciences understands that they have an opportunity for voice, a sense of value and of belonging, as well as feelings of investment and ownership in our collaborative mission to serve the educational needs of our community.

Read Dr. Reginald Jackson\u2019s thoughts on his upcoming course, \u201CAfrican American Music from 1619-Present.\u201D \"I am eagerly excited to provide our students the opportunity to explore the origins of African American Music. The influence of African culture on the development of African American Music cannot be underestimated. Additionally, this course will discuss the impact of contributors who created, preserved, and continue to diffuse this music throughout the world. Although the origin was, in many ways, very dark and difficult, the triumphs and the message of hope emerged into several unique styles of music that continue to touch lives in profound ways. This course surveys 400 years of music in context and culture while highlighting the musical contributions to African American Music. During this course, students will engage with live performances and discuss the improvisational nature which is inherent in Spirituals, Gospel, Jazz, Blues, and other styles of African American Music. This course is designed to provide historical fingerprints to the depth and breadth of African American Music from 1619 to the Present.\" If you would like to learn more about other majors, minors, and courses that elevate Inclusive Excellence across the College \u2014 including the B.A. in African American Studies, Ph.D. in Medical Sociology, and M.A. in Anthropology of Peace and Human Rights \u2014 visit and explore our undergraduate degrees and\/or graduate degrees pages.
