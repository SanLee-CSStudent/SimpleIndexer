Coronavirus Resources ? COVID-19 Testing Policy and Protocol COVID-19 Testing Policy and Protocol Initial Testing | Sentinel Testing | Exposure Notification | COVID-19 Reporting Policy | Student Isolation Location | Contact Tracing In order to safeguard the campus and reduce potential spread of the COVID-19 virus, we are requiring all students, faculty, staff, consultants (regularly on campus) and third-party vendors returning to campus for the fall 2020 semester to provide proof of COVID-19 negative PCR test result. Students who have tested negative for COVID-19 and have submitted documentation to Student Health Services will be permitted to move into on campus housing; participate in classes and campus activities; and enter the campus and university facilities (within 15 calendar days of re-entry). Faculty, staff, consultants (regularly on campus) and third-party vendors who have tested negative (within 15 calendar days of re-entry) and have submitted documentation to Human Resources will be allowed to resume their normal or assigned duties. New and returning students must meet the following medical requirements before moving into campus housing or registering for classes. These medical requirements include the normally required physical exam by a medical provider, mandatory immunization requirements, a TB questionnaire, COVID-19 testing and an authorization to treat form. Initial Testing for Re-entry Faculty & staff returning to campus will need to provide a negative COVID19 test within 15 calendar days of re-entry. All new and returning students onto Tuskegee University campus will be tested for COVID-19 before within 15 days calendar days and\/or immediately following their entry to campus. All students without 8 a negative test upon arriving to campus will be quarantined in their personal living quarters until a test result can be received. If found to be positive students will be placed in isolation housing, if negative quarantine restrictions (online classes only, no participation in student gatherings of any size, no use of cafeteria facilities) will be removed. Sentinel Testing Sentinel testing of faculty, staff, and students will be implemented to signal trends, identify outbreaks, and monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 on campus. Sentinel testing would involve conducting COVID-19 tests on a randomized sample of 15% of employees and students. Testing will be voluntary for most off-campus students. Students living in on-campus residential housing or participating in university sponsored extracurricular activities will be required to participate in sentinel testing. A subcommittee has been developed to create a specific process for randomization, notification, testing, and the handling of test results. Campus Clusters\/Exposure Notification As part of campus standard protocol to manage outbreaks, a trained team will be sent where there have been multiple confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a single location, a \u201Ccluster.\u201D The team will require COVID-19 testing, outside of the sentinel process, to faculty, staff, and students who may be part of a cluster and\/or involved in university sponsored extracurricular activities. Protocols to manage groups who may be required to quarantine\/ isolate have been established. Campus plans will offer technology-facilitated exposure notification to augment exposure notification performed by monitoring the Alabama Department of Public Health and local emergency management systems. The campus team will also provide appropriate guidance based on consultation with the local or state health departments, and the CRMC. If you have a positive test result, you must meet the following conditions to return to campus: You show no evidence of a fever, cough and\/or related symptoms. Your symptoms have improved (e.g., cough or shortness of breath have improved). You received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart. If you are in the local area, you may choose to obtain a COVID-19 test at one of the below facilities: Tuskegee University will conduct testing for students, staff, and faculty. Details as to the location and process will be announced at a later date.

Reporting Requirements Policy Tuskegee will abide by CDC and Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) guidance in reporting potential and confirmed COVID-19 cases, symptoms, and contacts. Tuskegee University defines isolation and quarantine as follows: Quarantine is the process in which people who have been exposed to a person known to be positive for COVID-19, but are not themselves known yet to be positive, are to remain separate from the general community and monitored. Isolation is the process in which people who are known to have a positive COVID-19 test result, are to remain separate from the general community to prevent the disease from spreading. If students and\/or employees, consultants, third-party vendors or contractors experience one or more symptom(s) that may be related to COVID-19, you must do the following: Contact your physician or student health services Quarantine immediately Employees should contact their supervisor If students, employees, consultants, third-party vendors or contractors have been notified that they have been exposed to a person with a positive test, the student or employee must: Contact your physician or Student Health Services Notify their supervisor or Dean of Students immediately Immediately quarantine until a test result has been received and follow appropriate guidance based upon the result Report test results to Student Health Services (students) or Human Resources (employees, temporary employees or contractors) immediately upon confirmation Student Isolation Location Isolation facilities will be made available for residential students. The same comprehensive services that are available to all students will be available to students in isolation. Students living off campus should isolate at home and contact Student Affairs to ensure appropriate resources and support. Contact Tracing Student Health Services will alert the Offices of Human Resources and Student Affairs and the Cabinet regarding affected students and personnel. A Contact Tracer will trace who may have been in contact with the affected person and make the appropriate notifications. As appropriate, Human Resources will work with department heads to transition the impacted personnel to remote working and coordinate with contractors or third-party vendors. Student Affairs will work with students to ensure the appropriate resources and support. The Contact Tracer, under the direction of Student Health Services, will conduct an investigation (following HIPAA guidelines) to confirm case details and follow-up with department heads. If a positive COVID-19 test is confirmed, please follow the procedures outlined below: Student Health Services will contact: Vice President of Facilities and Construction 10 To ensure the custodial staff cleans the facility following federal standards and place appropriate signage in areas to be quarantined until cleaned according to federal standards Human Resources to address employees in the immediate area of the confirmed case To gather their belongings, leave the building and prepare to work remotely To coordinate with Chief Information Officer and supervisor regarding possible remote work computer needs Chief of Tuskegee University Police Department To secure the location, keeping additional personnel out of the facility Vice President of Student Affairs To coordinate with TU President and Cabinet members regarding messaging to the community To work with Student Health Services to notify local public health officials.
