The goal of SMREC research is to develop farm management practices that will help the region\u2019s livestock, poultry, row crop and commercial vegetable producers\u2014particularly small-scale farmers\u2014to operate more efficiently, sustainably and profitably. AREAS OF RESEARCH MANURE AND NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT \u2013 Use of broiler litter in crop production VEGETABLES, FRUITS AND BERRIES \u2013 Evaluation of new cherry and grape cultivars for north Alabama PECANS \u2013 Evaluation of new cultivars for north Alabama VARIETY EVALUATIONS \u2013 Evaluation of new varieties of tall fescue, annual ryegrass and legumes as well as different varieties of corn, soybean, wheat, barley, oats, triticale and ryegrass History The Sand Mountain Research and Extension Center (formerly known as the Sand Mountain Substation) was established at Crossville in 1929 initially to investigate horticulture and truck crops, but studies in hog and poultry production gained the increasing attention of investigators in subsequent years. The first management unit established at Sand Mountain Substation was a 96-acre farm that combined cotton production with hogs and production of the necessary hog feed crops. A cotton-dairy unit was added later. The substation served as demonstration farm in the 1940s and during the 1950s and 60s was the site for cotton mechanization work under leadership of Tom Corley. Sand Mountain Substation was the site of an innovative approach to environmental protection in the early 1990s with the design and testing of artificial wetlands to filter waste water from a swine operation at the facility. A constructed wetland was effective in reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus levels of the swine lagoon water discharge. Success of this wetlands to filter waste water from a production unit provided pioneering results for use in agriculture. Sand Mountain Substation was one of the first five substations established in Alabama by the legislature to create research facilities in five main areas of the State: Tennessee Valley, Sand Mountain, Black Belt, Wiregrass and Gulf Coast. Three of the five went into operation in 1929: The Tennessee Valley Substation at Belle Mina, the Sand Mountain Substation at Crossville, and the Wiregrass Substation at Headland. The remaining two, the Black Belt Substation at Marion Junction and the Gulf Coast Substation at Fairhope, began operating in 1930.

Tennessee Valley Research & Extension Center Belle Mina, AL The Tennessee Valley Research and Extension Center is located just north of the Tennessee River, a stone\u2019s throw from Interstate 65, right in the heart of Alabama\u2019s top cotton-producing region and directly on the cutting edge of cotton research. Though TVREC research projects frequently target corn, soybeans and wheat, cotton claims the lion\u2019s share of attention, and it is for its cotton research that the center is nationally recognized. The TVREC was an early convert to precision agriculture technologies and today has a full inventory of global positioning system\u2013based equipment that includes autosteer tractors, yield monitors and light-bar guidance systems. AREAS OF RESEARCH COTTON \u2013 Variety evaluations and long-term fertility tests; sprinkler (overhead) irrigation, subsurface irrigation and fertigation; disease and nematode management VARIETY EVALUATIONS \u2013 Cotton, corn, soybeans and wheat PRECISION TECHNOLOGY \u2013 Evaluation of geospatial navigation tools for efficient application of plant nutrients History The Tennessee Valley Research and Extension Center (formerly known as the Tennessee Valley Substation) was established in 1929 in Belle Mina and immediately began studies involving poultry, corn, cotton and truck crops. The station\u2019s later work focused on pasture development as livestock became increasingly important in north Alabama. The station was the site for dairy demonstration units in the 1940s and during the 1950s and 60s was the site for cotton mechanization work under leadership of Tom Corley. Work on irrigation began in 1986 with the installation of an irrigation facility to study techniques needed by the farming industry.

CENTRAL Alabama Black Belt Research & Extension Center Marion Junction, AL Rolling prairie land and unique soil formations make the Black Belt Research and Extension Center in Marion Junction an excellent location for research on beef cattle and forages. The BBREC\u2019s primary research focus is in the areas of grazing and animal breeding. AREAS OF RESEARCH ANIMAL HEALTH, NUTRITION AND REPRODUCTION \u2013 Projects include grazing studies as well as animal breeding experiments. Numerous cross-breeding studies at the BBREC have provided valuable information to the beef industry. Scientists are also investigating the effect of winter grazing systems on cow efficiency measures. BEEF CATTLE \u2013 Projects include grazing studies as well as animal breeding experiments. Numerous cross-breeding studies at the BBREC have provided valuable information to the beef industry. FORAGE PRODUCTION \u2013 Scientists are investigating the effect of winter grazing systems as well as the productivity, use and nutritive quality of dallisgrass. VARIETY EVALUATIONS \u2013 Commercial varieties of grain sorghum are being evaluated for their resistance to the sugarcane aphid, which is causing significant economic losses throughout the Southeast. Various insecticide treatments also are being evaluated. History The Black Belt Research and Extension Center (formerly known as the Black Belt Substation ) at Marion Junction was established in 1930 and immediately focused upon restoring soil fertility to this much-abused land in an attempt to establish pastures to encourage the livestock industry. The substation was the site for dairy demonstration units in the 1940s and for beef cattle nutrition research in the 1970s. In the 1970s, researchers at the center were the first to associate poor cattle performance with endophyte fungus in fescue. That discovery resulted in new management strategies that allowed producers to dramatically increase weight gain in their herds and, subsequently, boost their profits. Beef cattle, dairying, forages, soybeans and other crops adapted to the area continue to receive research emphasis. BBREC was one of the first substations established in Alabama by the Legislature to create research facilities in five main areas of the state: Tennessee Valley, Sand Mountain, Black Belt, Wiregrass and Gulf Coast. Three of the five went into operation in 1929: The Tennessee Valley Substation at Belle Mina, the Sand Mountain Substation at Crossville and the Wiregrass Substation at Headland.

Chilton Research & Extension Center Clanton, AL It\u2019s fitting that the Chilton Research and Extension Center is located in the shadow of Clanton\u2019s famous giant peach water tower just off of I-65, because at the CREC, peaches rule. When the center was established in 1944, its mission was to identify superior varieties and develop new management techniques that would help Chilton County\u2019s peach producers maximize their profits. And that\u2019s still its mission today. The CREC does work with other small fruits\u2014most notably kiwifruit\u2014but peaches have priority. AREAS OF RESEARCH PEACHES \u2013 Chemical thinning projects, peach rootstock evaluation. PEST MANAGEMENT \u2013 Integrated pest management of the plum curculio. VEGETABLES, FRUITS, & BERRIES \u2013 Evaluation of plum, nectarine, satsuma, blackberry, fig, Japanese persimmon, muscadine, bunch grape and an assortment of vegetable varieties; Varietal research on kiwifruit is unique in the Southeast. History Established in 1948 on a 160-acre site near Clanton, the Chilton Research and Extension Center (formerly known as the Chilton Area Horticulture Substation) allowed extension of horticultural research into the central part of the state and promoted peaches as an increasingly valuable crop for the region\u2019s farmers. Although peaches absorbed the greatest attention of agricultural scientists, blackberries, sweet potatoes, beans peas, tomatoes and watermelons were also among the research interests of the station. The Chilton Area Horticulture Substation was one of the five substations established in Alabama during and a few years after World War II: Upper Coastal Plain in 1944, Piedmont Substation in 1945, North Alabama Horticulture Substation at Cullman in 1948, Chilton Area Horticulture Substation at Clanton in 1948 and the Lower Coastal Plain Substation at Camden in 1948.

In an exhaustive, multidisciplinary long-term study of the lab\u2019s approximately 100 captive white-tailed herd, researchers will generate detailed information on deer biology and behaviors that is expected to significantly impact the scientific management of deer. AREAS OF RESEARCH WHITE-TAILED DEER \u2013 The Piedmont Agricultural Research Unit provides a controlled environment for research on the biology of white-tailed deer. In a long-term study of approximately 100 captive white-tailed deer, researchers are generating detailed information on deer biology and behaviors that is expected to significantly impact the scientific management of deer. The field lab contains a diversity of habitats, including old pastures, hardwood uplands and bottomlands, planted pines and recent clear-cuts that are naturally regenerating. History The Piedmont Research Unit (formerly known as the Piedmont Substation) was established on 1,409 acres in 1945 in Tallapoosa Country near Camp Hill, Ala., to provide additional land for pasture and forage crops research. The Piedmont Research Unit\u2019s soil types offered opportunities for research to serve a unique farming area and over the years research has been conducted on field, forage and horticultural crop production and beef cattle farming. The substation was the site for a dairy demonstration unit in the 1940s In the 1990s, results of a 13-year study produced in-depth information about more than 60 native and exotic trees. Emphasis on wildlife management in more recent years has offered support for landowners interested in cashing in on the strong demand for hunting opportunities. Research over the past 75 years has resulted in the release of six new Chinese chestnut varieties that will yield a continuous high-energy food source for wildlife. The Piedmont Substation was one of the five substations established in Alabama during and a few years after World War II: Upper Coastal Plain in 1944, Piedmont Substation in 1945, North Alabama Horticulture Substation at Cullman in 1948, Chilton Area Horticulture Substation at Clanton in 1948 and the Lower Coastal Plain Substation at Camden in 1948.

History In 1988, the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station proposed updating its greenhouse facilities to keep up with changes in plant sciences research. The existing greenhouse facilities were located in central campus, surrounded by large buildings, limited in space and antiquated. In August 1991, the first stage of the Plant Science Research Center was completed. Located on the south side of the Auburn University campus and the only AAES research facility on campus, the center consists of 10,800 square feet of modern greenhouse space and a headhouse containing laboratory and work space. It provides researchers with the latest in greenhouse climate-control monitoring and regulating systems. In 2009, two additional greenhouse zones were added along with an updated, environmental control system with off-site monitoring and alarm capabilities. In 2011, the PSRC will gain additional work space upon the completion of the soil processing building. This area will house soil mixing equipment, an autoclave, soil and fertilizer storage areas, a walk-in cooler, loading dock and lab area for packing field samples. Future plans include the purchase of four growth rooms for containment research and insect studies. Staff Directory Jane Farr Director, Research\/Extension Ctr.

Areas of Research COTTON Early season insect control in the absence of in-furrow, at planting insecticides The influence of cropping systems in controlling the bollworm complex in conventional and genetically altered cotton varieties Development and evaluation of breeding material for future agronomic performance Variety evaluations VARIETY EVALUATIONS \u2013 Corn, cotton, small grain. SOILS \u2013 Long-term soil fertility studies on various crops. History The Prattville Agricultural Research Unit (formerly known as the Prattville Experiment Field) was established by 1930 and administered by the Department of Agronomy and Soils until the mid-1960s. The unit has largely been devoted to research on soil fertility and cropping methods. Located just minutes from the state capitol building in Montgomery, PARU has provided the bulk of the cotton insect work for central and southern Alabama during the past 30 years. During the past decade, cotton acreages have returned to South Alabama and even surpassed the Tennessee Valley region as the dominant production area of the state. Several major problems and events in cotton insect management and control occurred during this period. In the fall of 1986, the boll weevil eradication program was initiated and moved northward through the state. The next decade saw the outbreak of beet armyworms followed by pyrethroid-resistant tobacco budworms. The PARU was the primary site for research toward a solution to these problems. Data generated at PARU were used to justify a Section 18 Emergency Exemption for the use of Pirate insecticide against beet armyworms. Prattville was also one of the first locations to explore the value of Monsanto\u2019s genetically altered Bt cotton. This cotton proved to be exceptionally effective against the pyrethroid-resistant budworms. Prattville Experiment Field was one of ten experiment fields established and in operation by 1930 on tracts ranging from 33 to 60 acres in size. Of these ten, three remain in service today: Brewton Esperiment Field, Monroeville Experiment Field, and Prattville Experiment Field.

History The Gulf Coast Research and Extension Center (formerly known as the Gulf Coast Substation) began operating in 1930 at Fairhope, Ala. Research on seed potatoes obtained from the Midwest served as the primary focus for the substation researchers during the early years. Efforts to increase the phosphorus content of newly cleared acreage also received attention. Research on other horticultural crops, agronomic field and forage crops and dairy and beef cattle was implemented later. A lagoon waste management and wastewater recycling system in connection with the dairy unit was added in the late 1970s. The Gulf Coast Substation was one of the first five substations established in Alabama by the legislature to create research facilities in five main areas of the State: Tennessee Valley, Sand Mountain, Black Belt, Wiregrass and Gulf Coast. Three of the five went into operation in 1929: The Tennessee Valley Substation at Belle Mina, the Sand Mountain Substation at Crossville and the Wiregrass Substation at Headland. The remaining two, the Black Belt Substation at Marion Junction and the Gulf Coast Substation at Fairhope, began operating in 1930. Staff Directory Malcomb D.

Ornamental Horticulture Research Center Spring Hill, AL The Ornamental Horticulture Research Center (OHRC) in Mobile is located in an area of Alabama where commercial nurseries abound, and that\u2019s an ideal site for an applied-research facility dedicated primarily to supporting the commercial container-nursery industry. Research at the OHRC focuses on helping producers identify and address pest, disease and other production problems. Located in an urban setting, at 17 acres, the OHRC is the smallest among the Alabama Ag Experiment Station\u2019s outlying units. AREAS OF RESEARCH NURSERY PRODUCTION Use of night-interrupted light for perennial plant production Alternative media (various forestry products) as a supplement or replacement for pine bark in woody ornamental production Controlled release fertilizer evaluations DISEASE AND INSECT PEST MANAGEMENT Spray trials for leaf spot diseases Boxwood anthracnose control and etiology Water temperature manipulation for hydroponic lettuce production Etiology of Loropetalum gall disease HOW CAN I GET A SOIL TEST KIT?

If you have specific questions about a project or problem, contact us at 251-342-2366. We will make an appointment to discuss it. History The Spring Hill Ornamental Horticulture Substation (now the Ornamental Horticulture Research Center) can trace its beginnings to 1928 when an Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station entomologist was sent to Mobile to help Satsuma producers combat citrus pests. Work at the substation was gradually expanded to include azalea and camellia insects. In 1945 Auburn severed its ties to the unit, but six years later in response to a severe freeze in 1950 and to grower needs, Alabama legislation funded restaffing of the field station. Disease and insect control for ornamentals has been the major thrust for research at the station, but other aspects of nursery production have also been studied through the years. At 18 acres, the OHRC is the smallest among the Alabama Ag Experiment Station\u2019s outlying units. The substation was originally established on four acres near Mobile. In 1930 the city of Mobile deeded seven acres to Auburn University and in 1965 seven additional acres were deeded from Mobile to the station. Staff Directory John W.

Office Hours 7:30 AM \u2014 4:00 PM Monday \u2014 Friday Wiregrass Research & Extension Center Headland, AL A variety of soil types and land characteristics typical of the Coastal Plain allow the Wiregrass Research and Extension Center (WREC) to address problems that challenge farmers in this region. While the center has been a leader in all types of agronomic research, it is renown for its focus on peanuts. AREAS OF RESEARCH PEANUTS \u2013 A twenty-one year old ongoing crop rotation study centered around peanuts. CATTLE \u2013 Grassfed beef research utilizing multiple forage species. VARIETY EVALUATIONS \u2013 Field and forage crops, including peanuts, cotton, corn, small grain. History The Wiregrass Substation (now known as the Wiregrass Research and Extension Center) was founded in 1929 at Headland, Ala. Early work concentrated on cotton and corn, the traditional crops of the region, but the peanut crop soon began to absorb most of the research work at the station. After WWII farmers in the southeastern portion of Alabama steadily turned toward the cultivation of peanut as it became the primary cash crop in the region. AAES researchers used the Wiregrass land to address a host of problems associated with peanut production, including mechanical harvesting studies that reduced labor requirements for successful cultivation from 30 hours to only four hours per acre. During the 1950s and 1960s areas of peanut research included mechanization, insect and disease control, storage and marketing. An extensive peanut storage project was conducted to provide information for farmers, peanut handlers, and warehousemen on maintaining peanut quality during storage. Also during these decades work was conducted on mechanizing cotton harvest. A study in the 1980s found that the seeding rate for peanuts could be reduced without a significant reduction in yield or net returns. The foundation peanut seed organization is currently handled at Wiregrass. The Wiregrass Substation was one of the first five substations established in Alabama by the legislature to create research facilities in five main areas of the State: Tennessee Valley, Sand Mountain, Black Belt, Wiregrass and Gulf Coast. Three of the five went into operation in 1929: The Tennessee Valley Substation at Belle Mina, the Sand Mountain Substation at Crossville, and the Wiregrass Substation at Headland. The remaining two, the Black Belt Substation at Marion Junction and the Gulf Coast Substation at Fairhope, began operating in 1930.
