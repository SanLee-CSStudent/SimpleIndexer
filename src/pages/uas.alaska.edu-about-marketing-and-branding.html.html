UAS is committed to providing accessible websites: www.uas.alaska.edu\/policies\/accessibility.html Marketing and Branding Consistency is Essential Consistent branding across UAS and its Schools creates an overall image of mission clarity, coordination, and communication. Defining our university through consistent branding will raise our profile locally, regionally, statewide and nationally. Our goal is to unite the three campuses in Juneau, Ketchikan and Sitka in one visual message. Together, we can build community and alumni pride and attract, enroll and graduate more students! UAS Official Logos Diverse organizations, like universities, maintain a family of related logos, united by a common color palette. Whale Tail Logo: The main logo of UAS used for academic, administration, and marketing. The logo is comprised of two parts: the whale tail and the wordmark. Available in many variations designed to accommodate all campus, school and department names in both horizontal and vertical formats. School Spirit Logo: A design refresh has given the previous UAS logo a more athletic style, in keeping with its use for school spirit and merchandise. University Seal: Limited to official documents, the Chancellor, and selected merchandise. Partnership Logos: Joint entities with other organizations may qualify for an exception to the branding policy. Contact ackrein@alaska.edu for more information. Logos and Advertising Resources Materials representing the UAS institution, its campuses, and schools must coordinate with current brand design set by the Creative Manager, UAS Enrollment Management and Student Affairs.
