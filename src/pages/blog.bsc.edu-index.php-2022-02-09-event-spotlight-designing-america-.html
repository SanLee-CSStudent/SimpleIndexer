Writer, filmmaker, and historian Laurence Cotton served as the originator and consulting producer for \u201CFrederick Law Olmsted: Designing America.\u201D \u201CI and others in the Olmsted arena would say Olmsted is one of the most significant Americans of the nineteenth century, and he was so much more than the founder of modern landscape architecture,\u201D Cotton says. \u201CHe was a self-taught renaissance man, a philosopher of democracy, and a very thoughtful and probing personality.\u201D \u201CDesigning America\u201D premiered in 2014 and has been screened around the country, often in the cities across the United States shaped most by Olmsted\u2019s work. The documentary was screened in the BSC Geodome in January and introduced by Marjorie White, director of the Birmingham Historical Society, who spoke about the Olmsted legacy in Birmingham. Olmsted is known best for his groundbreaking architectural endeavors in New York: the country\u2019s first coordinated system of public parks in Buffalo, New York; protection of Niagara Falls, the country\u2019s first state park; and Central Park, the country\u2019s first landscaped public park and his first collaboration with Calvert Vaux. However, his work extends across the United States, and people often know Olmsted from the projects around them. In Birmingham, The Olmsted Brothers \u2013 the firm founded by Olmsted\u2019s sons, John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., to carry on the vision \u2013 designed the plans for George Ward Park and the Homewood Shades Creek Greenway (also known as the Lakeshore Trail). In 2007, Cotton began research on Olmsted with a documentary feature in mind. He was already familiar with Olmsted\u2019s work \u2013 especially through his childhood in the Boston area and his work as a park- and trail-planting volunteer in Portland \u2013 but wanted to dig deeper into Olmsted\u2019s life. \u201CA thousand lights went off,\u201D Cotton says. \u201CIf no one has done a Ken Burns-style documentary on the life and career of Olmsted, then it is time I do it.\u201D Cotton collaborated with filmmaker Lawrence Hott and his company, Florentine Films\/Hott Productions, on the film. Both have previously worked with Ken Burns \u2013 Cotton in a project when they were students at Hampshire College and Hott through co-founding Florentine Productions with Burns \u2013 and aimed towards a similar style in their Olmsted project. One of Cotton\u2019s top goals was to capture the different layers of Olmsted\u2019s impact, most of these through detailed explorations of specific projects and locations. The film spends time on Central Park, which Olmsted and Vaux began in 1857, and the struggles Olmsted faced during that time. \u201CIt is his most well-known project,\u201D Cotton says, \u201Cand by telling that story in full, you also reveal interesting aspects of his professional and personal story.\u201D The film covers Olmsted\u2019s other pursuits, including his work as a correspondent for the early iteration of The New York Times in the South during the Civil War, during which he wrote a series of influential essays now published together in \u201CThe Cotton Kingdom.\u201D Olmsted was later hired as director of the U.S. Sanitary Commission and led healthcare relief efforts among Union soldiers. Olmsted also worked as a literary publisher for some of the greatest American writers \u2013 including Washington Irving, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Harriet Beecher Stowe \u2013 and took a job in a California gold mining operation that introduced him to Yosemite Valley. \u201CHe was already acknowledged for his expertise and talents, and the state of California commissioned him to write a report, which recommended the permanent protection of Yosemite Valley,\u201D Cotton says. \u201CIt was not acted upon at the time but is now frequently pointed to as the founding document which led to the creation of Yosemite National Park and is considered in some respect a founding document for our entire national park system because of its poetic wording regarding places of pristine beauty where the public can seek solace and fresh air.\u201D Cotton will expand on more important parts of Olmsted\u2019s life in his talk and his discussions with architecture and urban environmental studies students. He also hopes to learn more about the Olmsted legacy in Birmingham and encourages students to learn more about Olmsted\u2019s trailblazing vision. \u201CLandscape architecture isn\u2019t just about design,\u201D Cotton says. \u201CIt\u2019s about people and social relations and human psychology. To have students of environmental design, architecture, and urban planning realize that Olmsted was working with this kind of vision back in the 1880s is really quite remarkable.\u201D In addition to the speaking event at BSC, Cotton will also give a talk for the Birmingham Botanical Gardens\u2019 Celebrating Olmsted event on Feb. 16.
