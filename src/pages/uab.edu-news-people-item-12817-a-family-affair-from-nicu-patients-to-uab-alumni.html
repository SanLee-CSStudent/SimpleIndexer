Written by: Laura Gasque and Hannah Echols Media contact: Hannah Echols After spending 87 days in the NICU with her twin daughters, Tara Wood decided to pursue nursing. She is now an assistant professor at the UAB School of Nursing and her daughters, Jade and Taylor, will graduate from UAB in April 2022. Photography: Frank CouchTara Wood planned to become a teacher until she found herself giving birth to twin girls at 26 weeks\u2019 gestation. They weighed under 2 pounds and spent 87 days in the neonatal intensive care unit. \u201CMy world was rocked,\u201D Wood said. \u201CMy babies were really sick. Both girls were on the ventilator for weeks. Their organs were premature, and you\u2019re faced with all the things that can go wrong. Just knowing that every minute mattered, it really put you in a constant state of terror and panic, of not really knowing how your babies are going to survive, much less thrive.\u201D Wood remembers not being able to hold her children for months. During that time, her lifeline to her girls was the nurses and nurse practitioners. She realized then that she wanted to become a nurse and provide similar support to other families. After working as a NICU nurse, Wood enrolled in the Master of Science in Nursing and Doctor of Nursing Practice programs at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing. She is now an assistant professor in the School of Nursing and the coordinator for the Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Specialty Track, teaching and preparing future nurses to care for infants and families. One of those students \u2014 her daughter Jade England. England, a fifth semester Bachelor of Science in Nursing student, graduates in April and will start her new job as a nurse in the Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the UAB Women and Infants Center. UAB\u2019s Refer a Future Blazer program provides resources for employees to help guide prospective students on the journey to become a Blazer.

I knew I needed to become a NICU nurse. I want parents to know that I was in their child\u2019s place and, without giving false hope, show them that miracles can happen.\u201D The UAB family ties do not stop there. Taylor England graduates alongside her twin sister, Jade, this spring with a degree in psychology from the UAB College of Arts and Sciences with a minor in legal affairs and certificate in mental health. After graduation, Jade England will begin working in the Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the UAB Women and Infants Center. Photography: Frank Couch\u201CI enjoyed seeing the difference my mom made supporting families in the NICU, but nursing did not seem like the right calling for me,\u201D Taylor said. \u201CThrough my classes, research opportunities and UAB organizations, I realized there were many ways to use my life experiences to positively impact someone else\u2019s life. My goal is to one day be a child psychologist.\u201D During her time at UAB, Taylor participated in the Psychology Honors Program, where she gained firsthand research experience studying ADHD in children, a condition her brother was diagnosed with when they were younger. She also served as a TrailBlazer, giving campus tours to prospective students and their families. For Wood, it is sometimes hard to believe her tiny, fragile NICU babies are graduating from college and starting their careers. Both Taylor (left) and Jade (right) hope to follow in their mom's footsteps and continue their academic careers at UAB. Photography: Frank Couch\u201CI\u2019m a proud mom, and I want to share them with the world because I think they were born to do great things,\u201D Wood said. \u201CThey have servants\u2019 hearts, and they want to help and do good. I\u2019m thankful for UAB because I think UAB has been a place that has really poured into them and allowed them the opportunity to do for others.\u201D While their undergraduate chapter closes, their UAB journey is far from over. Jade wants to follow in her mother\u2019s footsteps and plans to return to school next year to start the Post-BSN to DNP Nurse Practitioner Pathway to earn her Doctor of Nursing Practice degree. One day, she hopes to teach alongside her mom. Taylor plans to finish an internship to earn her mental health certificate and hopes to return to UAB in the future to continue her academic career. \u201CWe were looking for a college at the same time our mom was looking for a job,\u201D Taylor said. \u201CIt turned out that we all fell in love with UAB at the same time. Green and gold will forever run deep within our family.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
