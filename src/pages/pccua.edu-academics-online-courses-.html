The majority of the distance learning courses are web-based; however, the College delivers a few courses via interactive video technologies. Distance learning courses maintain the same integrity as traditional courses, but provide the course instruction in an alternate format. Students are encouraged to complete an orientation to distance learning prior to beginning any of the College's web-based courses. PCCUA is proud to be part of the University of Arkansas System, which offers courses that lead to an Associate of Arts Degree online.
