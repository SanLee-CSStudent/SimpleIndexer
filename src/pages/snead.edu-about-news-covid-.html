The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is now closely monitoring the spread of a new variant B, also known as Omicron. Preliminary reports suggest that Omicron is more transmissible than Delta, but perhaps not as potent. This document outlines the Spring 2022 Operational Plan for Snead State Community College instructional programs and operational services. Please read carefully as it covers important information about vaccination, COVID-19 exposure guidance, and remote work. Because COVID-19 is a fluid situation, this plan could require changes based on published regulatory guidance (regulatory guidelines) issued by the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Office of the Governor of the State of Alabama (State), and the Alabama Community College System Chancellor (ACCS). Vaccinations, Boosters and Flu Shots Vaccination remains the leading prevention strategy to protect individuals from the COVID-19 disease and end the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces the potential of severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Everyone five years of age and older is now eligible to get a free COVID vaccination. Flu season is also upon us. If you haven\u2019t already received a flu shot, you might consider getting one. We encourage students and employees to get vaccinated and boosted. COVID-19 Exposure Notification, Quarantine, and Isolation Definitions Close Contact is defined as within six feet of an infected person (laboratory confirmed) for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. Fully-vaccinated: People are considered fully-vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a two-dose series or two weeks after a single-dose vaccine. Persons with Positive COVID-19 Test Results Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, shall: Stay home for five days. If there are no symptoms or symptoms are resolving after five days, individual may return to campus\/work. The individual should test, if practicable, prior to returning to work. Individual shall wear a mask around others for five additional days. Note: If the individual has a fever, they should continue to stay home until the fever resolves. Persons with Exposure to COVID-19 Persons who are fully vaccinated within the last six months OR have been boosted shall: Wear a mask around others for 10 days. Test on day five, if possible. Persons who are fully vaccinated over six months ago and are not boosted or are unvaccinated shall: Stay home for five days. After that, continue to wear a mask around others for five additional days. Test on day five, if possible. If symptoms occur, individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative test confirms their symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19. The CDC\u2019s updated guidelines related to quarantine and isolation can be found here. The Alabama Department of Public Health\u2019s guidance can be found here. It is imperative that each person continues to do his\/her part to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in accordance with CDC Guidelines. This includes: Staying away from the workplace when you are not well. Regularly washing and sanitizing your hands. Avoiding touching your face, eyes, and mouth. Avoiding sneezing or coughing without appropriate covering of the nose and mouth. Remote Work As a reminder, the System Office does not recommend the general use of remote work as an employee-requested option to COVID-19 quarantine or isolation. Remote work can only be approved at the President\u2019s level and must be in strict accordance with local policy. In order to be considered for remote work approval, a request must be submitted and approved by the supervisor outlining the specific work that will be approved by the supervisor along with a calendar of the proposed remote days. The supervisor must also submit a detailed and documented recap of the remote work completed during the approved period. Local Conditions As you know, public health guidance can change quickly in this rapidly evolving environment. We will continue to monitor local, state, and national health and safety guidance and maintain contingency plans should they be needed.
