Admission Plan of Study Costs The Program In just six semesters, the Master of Athletic Training (M.A.T) program at Huntingdon College will prepare you for a career in sports medicine as an allied health care professional. Who Are Athletic Trainers? Athletic trainers work with physicians in the areas of injury prevention, injury evaluation, emergency care, therapeutic intervention, and organizational administration in a sports or active population environment. Athletic trainers (ATs) are highly qualified, multi-skilled health care professionals who provide service or treatment under the direction of or in collaboration with a physician. As part of the health care team, services provided by athletic trainers include injury and illness prevention, wellness promotion and education, emergent care, examination and clinical diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and rehabilitation of injuries and medical conditions. Why a Master's Degree? The National Athletic Trainers\u2019 Association (NATA), the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE), the Board of Certification, and the NATA Research and Education Foundation\u2014the entities who cooperatively form the Athletic Training Strategic Alliance\u2014have established the professional degree in athletic training at the master\u2019s level. Completion of a graduate degree in athletic training is required to sit for the Board of Certification examination after the fall of 2022. Vision, Mission, & Goals The Huntingdon Advantage Small classes and personal attention have been Huntingdon hallmarks since the College\u2019s founding in 1854, and the Master of Athletic Training program continues those important attributes a degree higher. Up to twelve students will be enrolled in each Huntingdon MAT cohort, assuring that each student receives expert personal attention and access to the tools, personnel, and clinical experiences that will build his or her resume as well as critical professional skills. Partnerships Huntingdon offers 21 NCAA-Division III athletic teams with whom athletic training students may intern. Huntingdon is in partnership with Pro-Impact Physical Therapy and Sports Medicine, which offers a clinic on the Huntingdon College campus that serves students, faculty, staff, and community members. Clinical Education Each Huntingdon MAT student will complete six (6) clinical internships working with a Certified Athletic Trainer, physicians, or other health care providers as part of the MAT program. The first five placements will occur simultaneously with coursework and therefore will be offered within drivable distance of Huntingdon College. The sixth placement will consist of an 8-week clinical immersion experience during which each student will participate in the totality of care as an athletic trainer in a setting supportive of his or her chosen career-specific field. Temporary relocation may be required. Clinical internship placement sites include hospitals; physician offices; fitness centers; sports medicine and physical therapy clinics; high school, college, semi-pro, or professional athletic teams; public safety; industrial settings; military settings; and the performing arts.
