Success is Right Ahead. Dean of Students The Dean of Students office is responsible for maintaining the well-being of CAC within the boundaries of student behavior on- and off-campus. CAC requires students to follow a code of conduct that emphasizes important values for both the campus community and the workplace. Get Involved If a student is found responsible for violating the Code or Residence Hall Rules and has been evicted from the Residence Halls or removed from campus, the student has a right to an appeal hearing. The members of the hearing assists the college as well as Residence Life to maintain a healthy academic community. The board consists of three students, three faculty and one support staff, who are given the authority to review the case and determine if the prior decision was accurate and\/or decide if the sanctions assigned were appropriate. The Dean of Students Office entrust these students to carefully deliberate over issues of responsibility and to make sanctioning recommendations based upon their findings. These recommendations can range from, probation to eviction to suspension or expulsion from the college. If you are interested in serving on a board, please contact our office at (520) 494-5341. Student Code of Conduct The Student Code of Conduct (the Code) sets forth standards that are expected of all students and is developed as a means of implementing fair and consistent standards of student conduct. The code outlines students\u2019 rights and responsibilities and the College\u2019s expectations with respect thereto. Every student is expected to be aware of the obligations and responsibilities imposed by the Code and comply with it. Please view the Code in the Student Handbook. In addition, students who live on the SPC campus should pay attention to an additional set of community living guidelines, in the Residence Life Compendium. If you would like to notify campus officials of a student issue or conduct concern, please use the Incident Reporting Form. Prevention & Education Programming The Dean of Students Office serves as the clearinghouse for prevention and education programming. We work with a variety of offices across campus and across the district to ensure our students and employees are aware of pertinent information regarding health, safety and civic obligations. If you need any information on what Central Arizona College offers for any of the following observances and\/or federally regulated programs, please contact us.
