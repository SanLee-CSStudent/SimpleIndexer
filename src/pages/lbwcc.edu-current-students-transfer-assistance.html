STARS is a web-accessible database system which provides guidance and direction for prospective transfer students in the State of Alabama. The STARS System allows public two-year students in Alabama to obtain a Transfer Guide\/Agreement for the major of their choice. This guide\/agreement, if used correctly, guides the student through their first two years of coursework and prevents loss of credit hours upon transfer to the appropriate public four-year university in Alabama. Although transfer guides\/agreements can only be printed for two-year to four-year transfers, the STARS system can still provide guidance and direction to transfer students who have a different transfer situation. For more information and to Get The Guide click What is STARS. 2 to 4 Transfer Program The Alabama Community College System's 2 to 4 Transfer Program facilitates the seamless transfer from our community college to selected independent colleges and universities in Alabama. The 2 to 4 Transfer Program is similar to the STARS System already in place in that it allows for the transfer to four-year institutions. A transfer agreement, if used correctly, will guide the student through his\/her first two years of coursework and prevent loss of credit hours upon transfer to the appropriate public - and now, through the 2 to 4 Transfer Program, selected independent - four-year colleges and universities in Alabama. For more information on the 2 to 4 Transfer Program click Transfer Guides. ? 2022 Lurleen B.
