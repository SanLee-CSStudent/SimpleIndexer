Begin the Survey ¡¿ Faculty Engagement Survey - Additional Information For the purposes of the survey, \u201Cfaculty engagement\u201D and \u201Cengaged scholarship\u201D relate to the recognized definitions of outreach and extension work in the Faculty Handbook, chapter 3: \u201Cthe function of applying academic expertise to the direct benefit of external audiences in support of university and unit missions.\u201D Engagement is inclusive of work performed through outreach units, Extension, or individual faculty assignments. Engagement encompasses several areas of activity: Instructional activities, non-credit programs, promoting learning over a lifetime and address continuing individual development and improvement of knowledge and skills needed for educational advancement, employment, and personal enrichment. Expert assistance, providing information and consultative services extending university expertise and knowledge on request to external constituents (individuals and organizations) to advise, solve problems and improve conditions. Civic engagement, encouraging collaboration between the institution and its larger community (local, state, regional, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. Faculty engagement in outreach and extension work is a priority in Auburn\u2019s 2019-2024 strategic plan. Outlined in \"Priority 3: impactful Service\" of the plan are outreach objectives to increase Auburn\u2019s engagement efforts in three areas: (1) we will be recognized by the state as the first resource for providing practical and innovative solutions; (2) we will increase access to educational opportunities and lifelong learning across the state, especially to underserved communities; and (3) we will strengthen our engagement with both public and private sectors in the state of Alabama to provide increased workforce development and economic growth. The term \"service\" is often used synonymously for \"outreach or extension.\" However, the Faculty Handbook distinguishes engagement in outreach and extension work from \"service.\" Therefore, faculty service activities such as departmental meetings, disciplinary meetings, committee work, and leadership roles such as search chairs and board positions, etc. should not be included as \"faculty engagement.\" 2015 Survey of Faculty Public Engagement Report Close Last Updated: May 24, 2022 CONNECT WITH OFE: (334) 844-5701 thoma07@auburn.edu \"...I believe in the human touch, which cultivates sympathy with my fellow men and mutual helpfulness and brings happiness for all\" \u2014 George Petrie, The Auburn Creed Office of Faculty Engagement 213 Samford Hall Auburn University, AL 36849 (334) 844-5701 Website Feedback | Privacy | Campus Accessibility | Copyright ?
