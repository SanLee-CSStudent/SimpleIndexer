The University of Alaska System, guided by the Board of Regents, is committed to: Improving the participation and success of Alaska Natives through educational achievement statewide, and Improving Alaska Native representation and success throughout the University of Alaska system. Understanding that the university is also underrepresented in other minority groups, the work from this process will inform efforts to increase diversity and success throughout the university\u2019s programs and operations. Structure A steering committee of leaders representing the University of Alaska Board of Regents, chancellors, and Alaska Native corporations, tribal entities, and organizations will help guide the process. The steering committee will serve in an advisory role to the university president. University based action teams led by their respective chancellor or designee will conduct a baseline evaluation of the climate for Alaska Native students, faculty and staff at each university. This evaluation will include both qualitative and quantitative data related to programs, recruitment, retention and academic success. Several members of the steering committee are members of the university action teams; this is by design to ensure alignment and communication across the working groups. Process After the action teams develop the baseline evaluation of each universities\u2019 current program offerings and data on the recruitment, retention and success of Alaska Native faculty, students and staff, the steering committee and action teams will develop an overarching five-year plan with specific system-wide and university-based goals and targets. Additionally, the process is expected to yield recommendations for policy and regulations changes. Concurrently and independently, it is anticipated that the ANCSA Education Consortium will compile information on programs focused on increasing education attainment by Alaska Natives. Representatives involved in this effort will be invited to participate in developing the UA System five-year plan.
