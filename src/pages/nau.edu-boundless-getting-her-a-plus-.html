For most of her life, Valeria Sandoval didn\u2019t think college was for her. She didn\u2019t even care about graduating from high school until a boyfriend challenged her mindset. \u201CHe was like, \u2018What do you mean you\u2019re not going to graduate high school?\u2019 I got embarrassed, you know? I would always ditch; that\u2019s kind of embarrassing.\u201D So she flipped the script. Or, in her words: \u201CI got my A+ going. And I did it super-fast, for A+, and I graduated.\u201D After proving to herself that she could succeed in school, Sandoval took the next step and enrolled in Arizona Western College in Yuma. She chose the community college because of its proximity to her hometown of Somerton, about a half-hour drive away. At AWC, she worked on completing her general education courses while planning to pursue an eventual nursing degree or certificate. But after a while, trying to juggle work and increasingly difficult courses became too frustrating; she dropped out to consider other options. She knew she wanted a career helping people, but had realized that nursing wasn\u2019t a good fit. With guidance from an AWC counselor and an assessment test, she returned to community college thinking about a career in social work. But as a first-generation student, she was on her own figuring out how to apply and pay for college beyond AWC. \u201CI knew I wanted to do something in my life,\u201D she says. \u201CI didn\u2019t think about leaving town. I\u2019m really close to my family. I\u2019d rather stay here, save money. So I finished my courses at AWC, and never in a million years would I have thought I would get my bachelor\u2019s, but I had some friends in my stats class at AWC who were going to do it. So I was like, you know what? If I could get financial aid and everything, I\u2019m all for it. And here we are.\u201D Here is close to the end of NAU\u2013Yuma\u2019s full-time, two-year social work program: Sandoval is on track to graduate in spring 2022. Her instructors have been supportive throughout, even when she contracted COVID. \u201CThe professors, they really\u2026they push us. They really motivate you, and then they give you chances. If life is going wrong, they completely understand.\u201D Right now, she\u2019s happily immersed in an internship. \u201CEverybody\u2019s doing internships at different places depending on what they like,\u201D she explains. \u201CI\u2019m at the Arizona Department of Child Safety in Yuma. I like to interact with people, go out.\u201D She\u2019ll have many job possibilities when she graduates. But the girl who never thought she\u2019d graduate from high school is also considering a master\u2019s degree. \u201CA lot of my classmates are talking about grad school. That\u2019s been on my mind, but I don\u2019t know.\u201D What she does know is that she wants to stay in southwestern Arizona, near her family, for her education and career. But first, she\u2019s planning a trip to Flagstaff to celebrate her achievement at the commencement ceremony in May. SHARE YOUR STORY What goals have you crushed?
