Lyon College knows that being a good chemist is more than just having technical competence. Employers want scientists with excellent oral and written communication skills and the ability to interact effectively with people.

Chemistry majors at Lyon acquire hands-on experience with professional-level instrumentation, and nearly all of them engage in research, either with a Lyon professor or during summer research experiences funded by the National Science Foundation. Because of Lyon\u2019s low student-to-faculty ratio, chemistry majors develop personal relationships with their faculty mentors that endure beyond graduation. Ways To Get Involved Lyon hosts a chapter of Student Affiliates of the American Chemical Society, which sponsors educational events and works with community organizations like the Humane Society. Chemistry students are involved in a wide range of other campus organizations, such as Mortar Board and Chi Beta Phi honor societies, fraternities and sororities, the pipe band, chorus, and other musical groups. Student Spotlight What are reasons to choose the Chemistry program at Lyon? \u201COur research opportunities by far! Through faculty recommendations, I was able to secure an REU as a freshman, and as a junior and senior I've been able to complete two internships in industry, as well as help Dr. Burt Hollandsworth on two different chemistry projects. As a senior, I will have much deeper faculty connections and much better & broader research experiences than most of my friends back in Texas; these are invaluable for both grad school and job applications. Institutionally, for such a small school, the research we put out is very impressive,\u201D -Junior John Pruden, of Allen, Texas. \u201CTo any student considering majoring in chemistry, I would tell them that it is very difficult but so much fun and I would advise them to keep all of their notes from every class as a reference (there are many things to remember). Chemistry at Lyon is distinctive because professors here will challenge you to understand experimental design and data analysis on a higher level; you won\u2019t just know the material, you will graduate equipped with problem solving skills that will benefit you in any future career,\u201D -Senior Kayla Calhoun of Shreveport, La.
