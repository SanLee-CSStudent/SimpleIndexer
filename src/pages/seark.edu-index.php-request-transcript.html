Southeast Arkansas College has contracted with the National Student Clearinghouse to process online transcript requests and electronic delivery of transcripts to the location of your choice. You can track the processing of your electronic transcript request online and receive email or text message status updates. You can request to have your transcript sent now, which reflects your current grades as of the day you make the request. Or, you can request to have your transcript held until the end of the term for degrees and\/or grades.
