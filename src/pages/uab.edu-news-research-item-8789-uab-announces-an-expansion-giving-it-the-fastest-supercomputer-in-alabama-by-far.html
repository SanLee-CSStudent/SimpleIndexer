Frank Skidmore, M.D., relies on the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s high-performance supercomputer to help process the brain images he studies to research diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s. The latest expansion of the UAB supercomputer \u2014 named Cheaha after Alabama\u2019s highest peak \u2014 increases the computer\u2019s power fourfold and will reduce the amount of time it takes to process one brain image to less than two hours, an improvement that can lead to advanced diagnosis and treatment, Skidmore says. \u201CWhat Cheaha has allowed me to do is accelerate the entire research process,\u201D said Skidmore, UAB associate professor of neurology. \u201CIf you can see better, you can plan better; you can treat better.\u201D \u201CWhat Cheaha has allowed me to do is accelerate the entire research process,\u201D said Skidmore. \u201CIf you can see better, you can plan better; you can treat better.\u201D UAB has added 72 graphics processing units, which will boost the Cheaha supercomputer\u2019s power to 450 teraflops. A teraflop is a unit of computing speed equal to 1 trillion floating-point operations per second. This latest expansion makes Cheaha far and away the fastest supercomputer in Alabama and one of the five fastest at academic institutions in the Southeast \u2014 and knocking on the door of the Top 500, a list of the fastest supercomputers in the world. \u201COur goal is to empower greatness in others,\u201D said Curtis A. Carver Jr., Ph.D., vice president and chief information officer. \u201CUAB\u2019s continued investment in the high-performance computing infrastructure can lead to exciting discoveries by our researchers, faculty and students that change the world.\u201D Improving overall IT infrastructure on campus has been vital to giving UAB researchers competitive advantages for grants and to make world-changing discoveries. Among the improvements in recent years are a new Science DMZ that gives researchers a dedicated network to share information and a 100Gb network that improves speed and capacity across campus. \u201COur commitment to expanding the IT infrastructure at UAB gives us an advantage as we attract the top talent among students, faculty and staff, and as our campus community secures grant funding to pursue better care for our patients and new discoveries in all disciplines.\u201D \u201COur commitment to expanding the IT infrastructure at UAB,\u201D said UAB President Ray L. Watts, \u201Cgives us an advantage as we attract the top talent among students, faculty and staff, and as our campus community secures grant funding to pursue better care for our patients and new discoveries in all disciplines.\u201D Future plans for the supercomputer at UAB include boosting the power of the Cheaha supercomputer to 1,000 teraflops, increasing IT staff resources to work closely with researchers to meet their computing needs, and expanding partnerships with Oak Ridge and the National Science Foundation so that UAB researchers can use their computing power if needed. The current expansion of the Cheaha supercomputer was funded by UAB Information Technology; but previous expansions were paid for by a combination of university funds \u2014 including from the president\u2019s strategic fund, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the schools of Engineering and Public Health \u2014 as well as by a grant from the Alabama Innovation Fund. UAB IT worked with Dell to install the new graphics processing units. UAB has more than $500 million in annual research and development expenditures, and secures more research funding every year than all other universities in Alabama combined, bringing high-impact innovations, as well as jobs and a tremendous economic benefit, to Birmingham, Alabama and beyond. UAB is Alabama\u2019s largest single employer and has an annual economic impact exceeding $7.15 billion in the state. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
