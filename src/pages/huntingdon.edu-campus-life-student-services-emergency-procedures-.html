Hazards by definition are any source of danger that may or may not lead to an emergency or disaster. Natural hazards include significant weather events (such as severe storms) while man-made or technological hazards range from fires, accidents, cyber attacks and violent criminal\/terrorist acts. Prevention, Protection and Mitigation Risk or hazard assessment is an essential component of any emergency management plan. Risk or hazard assessment can be defined as identifying the sources of danger that could potentially cause an emergency or disaster. Huntingdon College\u2019s priority and focus is to manage these hazards through established prevention, protection and mitigation guidelines. This plan also identifies specific actions that can be undertaken to minimize or eliminate these vulnerabilities. This increases the probability that the effect of any disaster or event is prevented or mitigated\/minimized while the protection of life, property and return to normal operations is the focus and priority of the College. Huntingdon College has identified the above listed hazards that potentially pose a public safety issue or threat to the College community. Remember, you too are responsible for preparing yourself for an emergency or disaster event. To see how you can prepare for, protect yourself from, mitigate and respond to hazards or other public safety risks see the Standard Operating Procedures the College has outlined below (Use the links below for information on how you should handle any Campus emergency). Communications A critical factor in any emergency management plan is communications. It is often the weakest link in any emergency response or operation. The dissemination of accurate and timely information to the Huntingdon College community and stakeholders plays a major role in the effective prevention, protection, mitigation, response to and recovery from an emergency event. This emergency management plan serves as one vehicle to prepare, protect and mitigate against public safety incidents or other hazards. Huntingdon College is committed to your safety by transmitting timely and accurate information to you using various outlets described below. If you ever need emergency assistance call 911 and Campus Security telephone numbers 334-324-6565 when safe to do so.

Emergency Notification Systems In the event of an actual or potential emergency, crisis situation, or significant hazard event that may affect you or the Huntingdon College community or its operations, all students, faculty, staff, and administrators will be notified as soon as possible through the College\u2019s Emergency Notification System called \u201DHawk Alert.\u201D The Hawk Alert System will transmit information and instructions about the situation or incident, and what actions you need to take. Students will receive this message by e-mail or via text messaging on your cell phone or other personal device. Faculty, staff, and administrators will receive this message via e-mail, cell phone\/personal devices, or office telephone. Local media outlets can also be consulted for information as the College will make statements to the media, and ensure accurate information is available to the community.
