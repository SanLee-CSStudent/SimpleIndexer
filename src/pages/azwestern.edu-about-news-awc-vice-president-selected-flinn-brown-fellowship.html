The 14th cohort of Flinn-Brown Fellows was selected by the Arizona Center for Civic Leadership at the Flinn Foundation to participate in its prestigious leadership program on state policy and politics. The group represents nine Arizona counties and serves in private and public sectors, including business and industry, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations. Becoming a Flinn-Brown Fellow brings membership in the distinguished Flinn-Brown Network and participation in the Flinn-Brown Academy, a 12-session policy institute that offers rigorous learning about Arizona policy and politics \u2013 and connections with top state leaders and policy experts. The Academy begins in August and concludes with the annual Flinn-Brown Convention in November, a day-long professional-development gathering for the entire Flinn-Brown Network. \u201CThe Flinn-Brown Fellowship is an honor I truly appreciate,\u201D said Dhawan. \u201CThis program will provide unparalleled opportunities and learning experiences in service with fellow peers from all over Arizona. I look forward to connecting at events that will help expand my knowledge on how we can better address long-term issues here locally as well as statewide.\u201D The Fellows were chosen following interviews with a selection committee of eight Arizona leaders. More information about the Flinn-Brown Fellowship can be found here. \u201CBeing named a Flinn-Brown Fellow is an enormous accomplishment and well deserved. Reetika is already an important community leader, and this opportunity will position her to play a prominent role at the state level as well. We are all very proud of her,\u201D said AWC President Dr. Daniel Corr. Dhawan began her work with the college district in Parker, Arizona as a math faculty member and as a co-division Chair for Math and Engineering. She went on to lead the Career & Technical Education (CTE) division as Dean before being named Associate Vice President of Workforce Development and CTE in 2020 and Vice President of Workforce Development and CTE in 2021. In her current position, Dhawan has had many unique opportunities to engage in transformative leadership. She has served on numerous boards and received multiple accolades for teaching and administration, including the Vice President Innovation Award, Teacher of the Year, and the Heart of Yuma Leadership Award. She is also a governing board member for the Southwest Technical Education of Yuma. Holding master\u2019s degrees in Physics and Applied Math, Dhawan is currently seeking her doctorate in Instructional Design.
