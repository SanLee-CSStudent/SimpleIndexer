We offer classes in art appreciation, art history, studio classes in drawing, two-dimensional and three-dimensional design, painting, print-making, sculpture, and ceramics.

Art is about life, and that sums it up. --Louise Bourgeois Whether you are an aspiring artist or just love art and want to learn more, there is a place for you in the Department of Art.
