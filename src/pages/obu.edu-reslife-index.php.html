Apartment Residents: You will need to have your utilities on before you can move in. Packing Tips The first challenge of your college experience may be figuring out how to squeeze the essential possessions of two people into one residence hall room. Communicate with your roommate before you arrive on campus especially concerning large items such as microwaves, refrigerators and televisions. Arkadelphia does have a Walmart, Brookshire's grocery and several discount stores and pharmacies. However, we recommend that you come prepared with as much as you can since these stores will be taxed heavily due to the large influx of students. Here are our suggestions as you think about packing for Ouachita: bedding - sheets, mattress pad, pillow, bedspread towels and washcloths soap hangers, iron, ironing board trash can scissors, stapler, hole punch pens, pencils, hi-liters post-it notes, super-glue 3M Command Strips and white sticky tack* computer paper, envelopes, stamps, tape rubber bands, paper clips umbrella liquid laundry detergent - no pods! vacuum cleaner, cleaning supplies can-opener, plastic ware, plates, cups, bowls paper towels, Kleenex first-aid kit computer (LAN cable if not wireless) TV and connecting cables radio, stereo alarm clock study lamp (NOT halogen) carpet curtains and tension rods (NOT anchor brackets) dry erase board Students are allowed to bring the following appliances: Refrigerator* that must be smaller than 4.5 cubic feet. Microwaves,* small is encouraged. Televisions,* flat screen TVs may not be mounted to the walls. *Only one of each of these appliances is allowed per room. Not only does this help with energy consumption, but also with each student's living space. Please do NOT bring the following items: Pets Candles, which are not even permitted for decoration Incense Open flame \/ open coil appliances Halogen lamps Weapons: If you are a hunter, contact Student Development about storing your firearm. Wireless printers are strongly discouraged. Learn more about on-campus printing. Additional Info Our Staff View the residence life & housing staff dedicated to your on-campus experience. Housing & Residence Life Staff Who We are WE ARE... people who are passionate about community. Here's what we mean. Each ResLife staff member meets each week with his\/her mentoring supervisor to discuss floor issues and, well, anything really. Each staff team also meets every week for support, information sharing, and time together. We're here for you! Oh yeah, and we like to share food and tea and coffee. Swing by your RA's room sometime! WE ARE... people who care about others. ResLife staff members care for students! We work hard to notice students' struggles, talk and pray with our mentoring supervisors about them, and help our residents struggle in healthy ways. We're here to listen. We're here to help. And if we can't help, we'll get you connected with someone who can! WE ARE... people who are learning and growing. Why go to college if not to grow? Ouachita's ResLife staff is not only here to facilitate growth, but to do a little growing of our own. RAs have the opportunity to be trained to care for other, mentored in their ministry to others, and to learn the practice of community. WE ARE... looking for people who fit. If you're interested in a leadership and ministry position on campus, ResLife may be a good fit for you! If you're interested, ask your Resident Assistant (RA) or Resident Director (RD) what ResLife is like. Interested in applying for a Resident Assistant (RA), Associate Resident Director (ARD) or Apartment Manager (AM) position? LEARN MORE THE PROCESS There are two parts to the housing process: application and sign-up. APPLICATION: Each student will apply to live in a group of four. These four students\u2019 completed hours will then be averaged. The average hours will then be ranked highest to lowest. This will determine the order that students sign up for housing locations. Students who do not complete an application - or submit incomplete applications - will be placed at the bottom of the list. SIGN-UP APPOINTMENT: Each group of 4 will be assigned a housing sign-up time; your group representative will receive this time via campus email. Every member of the group does not need to be present. You may send one representative from your group of four if you wish. When you arrive at your appointment, you will have five minutes to choose any room that has not yet been chosen. Residence hall buildings and floors that have been filled will be posted outside the sign-up location so that students may make their determination BEFORE walking into their appointment. We recommended you arrive 10-15 minutes early to your appointment to see what buildings and floors are available. Wait List In order to avoid holes in the higher priority halls, a wait list will be constructed for students wishing to live in a hall when no space is available. After signing up for a housing assignment, a group of four may choose to sign up for a wait list for another residence hall or floor. If an opening should open up in a particular hall, the housing staff will consult the wait list to fill it. The wait list may be capped at the discretion of ResLife staff. TIE-BREAKERS: If two or more groups of applicants are tied for number of hours completed, the order of these groups will be determined at random. The Student Services staff will conduct the random ordering of these groups with a student present. PENALTIES & CONSEQUENCES: In general, a group not following the process guidelines may be added at the bottom of the housing list. Incomplete applications such as only 2 or 3 applicants; late application; application problem, such as one person showing up on two applications; falsifying information on an application -- all could result in being placed at the bottom of the housing list. Students also forfeit their place in line if they miss or show up late to their housing appointment. They will be given a new housing appointment. If all four members of the group 1) are in class or participating in a University-sponsored event and will missing the housing appointment and 2) have communicated this to the Assistant Director of Residence Life, it will not result in being moved to the bottom of the list. Group members in this situation are responsible for communicating this to Student Services to prevent being penalized. Off-Campus Housing An important part of Ouachita's education experience is living on campus. Although living on campus is highly encouraged, students may request an exception by completing a Request for Exception to Non-University Housing Policy form. **The form may be requested by calling 870-245-5220 or from the Office of Student Development.
