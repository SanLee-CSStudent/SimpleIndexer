PCCUA is committed to helping every student succeed providing quality, affordable, and accessible education. Points of Pride: PCCUA is an Achieving the Dream Leader College. Leader Colleges are selected based on their committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systemic institutional improvement. The PCCUA-Stuttgart Grand Prairie Center (GPC) has a strong arts program featuring a performance season, which provides opportunities for some of the artists to reach out to younger audiences with free shows for school children and special workshops and opportunities for some of the artists to connect with the community. Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas (PCCUA)-Helena has a partnership with Helena Little Theatre allowing the College and Little Theatre to collaborate on community productions, such as Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, and many other musicals. In addition, it has a partnership with the Warfield Concert Series, which funds the performances of operas, musicals, symphonies, and other musical performances at no cost to the public. Some presentations include Swan Lake performed by the Moscow Ballet, Step Africa, Alvin Ailey II and many more world class performances. PCCUA was invited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) to participate in the Higher Learning Commission\u2019s Open Pathway Construction Project, a new model for accreditation. PCCUA is one of only three Arkansas colleges and universities and one of only about 20 within thousands of HLC accredited colleges and universities invited to pioneer this process because of accreditation standing with HLC. PCCUA has Food Pantries and Clothes Closets on all of its campuses. PCCUA consistently receives national ranking in the top five Arkansas Best Colleges. See Bestcolleges.com. The PCCUA Associate Degree Nursing program receives national ranking in the top five Arkansas Best Colleges. See Bestcolleges.com. PCCUA has administered the GEAR UP Partnership since 2005 and will begin its third GEAR UP grant, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Education with a dollar-for-dollar match requirement for the partnership. PCCUA is the only Arkansas college awarded a grant. The current $8.2 million grant supports junior high and high school students in eight area school districts (Barton-Lexa, DeWitt, Dumas, Helena-West Helena, Lakeside, Lee County, Marvell-Elaine, and Stuttgart) by providing faculty development, student programs, and direct programming for students through a summer program.
