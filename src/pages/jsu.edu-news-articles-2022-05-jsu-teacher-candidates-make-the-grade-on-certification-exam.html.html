Photo by Matt Reynolds. by Brett Buckner JSU\u2019s teacher candidates are at the head of the class when it comes to preparation. Graduating education majors have earned a 95 percent pass rate on the high-stakes Teacher Performance Assessment, demonstrating their readiness for the classroom. \u201CReceiving such a high pass rate speaks volumes to the college\u2019s efforts to have its students ready for Day 1 in the classroom,\u201D said Dr. Kimberly White, dean of the JSU College of Education and Professional Studies. \u201COur current graduates are school and learner-ready when they complete our programs. I have no doubt that our future graduates will be just as prepared to go anywhere in the world and positively impact student learning.\u201D Developed by the Stanford Center for Assessment, Learning and Equity in 2009, the Teacher Performance Assessment \u2013 or edTPA \u2013 measures a teacher candidate\u2019s abilities in planning, instruction and assessment, along with the ability to differentiate different student needs. It requires aspiring teachers to submit a portfolio of materials for review, including a series of lesson plans, a video of themselves teaching and written analysis of their instructional practice. Since 2018, Alabama has used edTPA as an assessment option for candidates seeking initial teaching certification. All new teachers in Alabama must pass this nationally-scored assessment. \u201CThe theme for our college is \u2018reaching a world-class standard\u2019,\u201D White said. \u201CTo this end, faculty and staff members in our educator preparation programs are committed to providing engaging learning-centered experiences to help candidates develop the knowledge, skills and professional dispositions necessary for success at the highest level \u2013 and our candidates always rise to meet this expectation.\u201D Founded in 1883 as a teachers\u2019 college, JSU has always been known for producing the best and brightest teachers for Alabama\u2019s schools. The College of Education and Professional Studies offers bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and education specialist degrees and its programs are accredited by the Alabama State Department of Education, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation.
