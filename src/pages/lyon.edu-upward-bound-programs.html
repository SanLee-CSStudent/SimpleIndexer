TRIO includes eight outreach and support programs targeted to serve and assist low-income, first-generation college students, and students with disabilities to progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to postbaccalaureate programs. Two TRIO programs are available on the campus of Lyon College: Upward Bound and Upward Bound Math-Science. APPLE Project Upward Bound The APPLE (Accelerated Program of Personalized Learning and Enrichment) Project Upward Bound program provides academic and personal support to participants in their preparation for college entrance. The program provides opportunities for participants to succeed in their precollege performance and ultimately in their higher education pursuits. The APPLE Project serves high school students from low-income families and from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree. The goal of the APPLE Project is to increase the rate at which participants complete secondary education and enroll in and graduate from institutions of postsecondary education. The Project hosts both an Academic Session and a residential Summer Session for eligible participants from target schools in Independence, Jackson, Sharp, and Stone counties. Upward Bound Math-Science (UBMS) The Upward Bound Math-Science Program helps students recognize and develop their potential to excel in the fields of math and science and pursue postsecondary degrees in these fields. The goal of the program is to help students achieve the academic preparation, motivation and confidence needed to complete high school and to successfully pursue postsecondary programs, especially in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) field. The Program serves students from low-income families where neither parent holds a bachelor's degree. The Program offers students the opportunity to participate in mentored research in a math or science related subject with college level faculty, take exciting field trips and select from a variety of classes and activities to strengthen their preparation for college. The Project hosts both a Residential Summer Session and an Academic Year Session. Lyon College Start Your Future Lyon is more than just a college.
