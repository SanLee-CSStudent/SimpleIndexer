All travel involves risk, requiring individuals to be primarily responsible for their personal safety, security, and health. The UAS International Travel Assistance Program was established to assist travelers in times of unexpected circumstances that call for prompt action. The services and resources available in this program are provided by International SOS, an international travel assistance company. While not a substitute for personal preparation and diligent emergency precautions, our objective is to provide assistance in times of need. All UAB travelers should familiarize themselves with the services and resources available through the Travel Assistance Program. Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) The Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) is a free service for U.S. citizens traveling abroad to enroll their travel with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate and receive important information from the embassy about safety conditions in your destination country, helping you make informed decisions about your travel plans. Your enrollment will help the U.S. embassy, family, and friends contact you in an emergency. Enroll your Travel ¡æ Students The UA System mandates that all students traveling internationally for UAB-related programs\/or businesses are enrolled in the International Travel Assistance Program, organized by International SOS. The Office of Education Abroad will initiate this enrollment on your behalf. The International Travel Assistance Program helps UAB students before departure and during their time abroad for medical purposes and some travel-related incidents. Health insurance costs may be found on your UAB Education Abroad application. As a UAB student, your student account will be automatically billed for this expense. If you are traveling as part of an organization, conference, or internship\/service-learning group, check with your sponsoring department to see if they will be taking care of these charges on your behalf. The Office of Education Abroad will provide you with your insurance cards during your Pre-departure Orientation. Information regarding the International Travel Assistance Program can be found on your application under Learning Content. We encourage you to download the International SOS app from your app store. You can find detailed information about our insurance provider, International SOS, by reviewing the policy brochure. ISOS Assistance App With the International SOS Assistance App, students are able to sign up for updates and alerts for their destination, research medical and security risks and get advice, check-in during crises, and call ISOS for help or advice. We strongly encourage all students to download the ISOS Assistance App prior to going abroad. Download the ISOS Assistance App ¡æ Faculty UAB supports and encourages international travel by employees for the purpose of furthering the educational, research, and service missions of UAB. Employees traveling on UAB business should be aware that policies and procedures governing behavior and financial affairs apply regardless of the location where the UAB business is conducted. It is recommended that UAB travelers check the \u201Cstatus\u201D of the country\/countries that they plan to visit through the Travel Advisories section of the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Webpage and\/or the Webpage of International SOS when planning their travel and immediately prior to departure. UAB maintains the right to restrict travel to regions with a heightened safety risk. UAB employees (i.e., faculty, staff, post-doctoral employees\/, medical residents and fellows), who plan to travel internationally on UAB-related business, are required to submit an online International Travel Registration Form (ITR) prior to travel regardless of whether the travel is funded by UAB sources or an outside source. Travel for personal reasons that is part of the UAB-related trip may be reflected in the International Travel Registration. Submitting the ITR, automatically links travel of employees to the UAS International Travel Assistance Program provided by International SOS and allow UAB to receive real-time information and alerts about UAB travelers and their destination county or countries. To take full advantage of the services and resources provided by International SOS, employees are encouraged to download the International SOS app prior to going abroad.
