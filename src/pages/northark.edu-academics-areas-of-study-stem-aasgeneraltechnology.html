About The Program The Associate of Applied Science in General Technology enables a student to design an individualized program of study to fulfill a unique career goal that cannot be met through the completion of any single technology program offered by the College. This is accomplished by selecting courses from two or more different technical disciplines and developing a coherent technical program having both a major technical focus and support courses directly related to the career objective. In order to be considered for admission to this program, the student completes a proposed program of study with the assistance of a career counselor and the Technical Programs Department Chair. Technical Disciplines Automation and Systems Integration Accounting Automotive Service Technology Collision Repair Technology Computer Aided Design Construction Equipment Operation Construction Technology Electronics Technology HVAC Information Technologies Manufacturing Technology Office Management Outdoor Power Equipment Truck Driving Welding Technology Paying for College Northark is affordable!
