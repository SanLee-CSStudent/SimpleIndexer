Karen Hindhede is Professor of English and District Chair of Communications for Central Arizona College. She and her family, including her 10 year old daughter, participated in the study abroad program in Cuernavaca, Mexico. When asked why she was interested in traveling internationally to study, Professor Hindhede said, \u201CI love traveling! I enjoying learning about the history, art, customs, religion, politics\u2014the everyday life\u2014of people elsewhere. I also wanted to improve my very basic Spanish skills and provide my daughter an opportunity to travel and study in the Spanish speaking world. The program was affordable and the two week option was good way to introduce my daughter to an international experience.\u201D Professor Hindhede elected to stay with a host family in Mexico to get a truly immersive experience. She says, \u201CDuring our homestay in Mexico, I was surprised and delighted how much my host mother and I were able to communicate with one another despite my rudimentary Spanish. Having just a few days in Mexico gave me more vocabulary and encouraged me to attempt our communication.\u201D To those students who are interested, but unsure if study abroad is right for them, Karen says, \u201CStudy abroad is ideal for students who are curious. Study abroad programs push people out of their comfort zone, but in small, safe ways. Central Arizona College offers many short programs, so the risk is small. It\u2019s a great way to test one\u2019s interest.\u201D This program is ideal for students seeking to learn Spanish, but is also great for professionals. Teachers, Educators & School Administrators Improve interaction with Spanish-speaking students and parents with increased language fluency and enhanced cultural understanding. Spanish language teachers will improve language skills and discover new teaching methodologies. Teachers will become more culturally competent and comfortable teaching in a diverse classroom setting.
