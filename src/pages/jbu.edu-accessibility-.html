{"id":311,"title":"Accessibility","url":"https:\/\/www.jbu.edu\/accessibility\/","content":"Commitment to Accessibility Accessibility John Brown University is committed to facilitating access to instruction, communication, research, and business processes while enhancing community building for the broadest possible audience. This commitment is based on our deeply held belief that all individuals are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. In furtherance of this commitment, and to ensure that all members of our community can enjoy John Brown University\u2019s educational and employment opportunities, we continually look for ways to make our facilities, services, and accommodations more convenient to use. To that end, we offer the same or equivalent access to products, services, and facilities as is provided to those without disabilities, and we prohibit discrimination, retaliation, coercion, interference, intimidation, or any other adverse action against individuals on the basis of disability. We routinely review our facilities for accessibility, paying careful attention to parking spaces, curbs, ramps, doors, entrances, lobby areas, and more. To accommodate persons who have vision impairments, John Brown University always offers our covered community members assistance with reading, filling out, and completing forms. For persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, we accept telecommunication relay service calls through 7-1-1 service to 479-524-7464, and strive to provide sign language interpreters upon advance request. We are also proud to offer an atmosphere friendly to service animals and guide dogs. At John Brown University, understanding that we serve a diverse audience that relies increasingly on the Internet for many aspects of life, including education, employment, commerce, research, and recreation, we believe that it is essential to strive to provide equal access and opportunity to all our users, including those with disabilities. In this respect, we are committed to enhancing our community members\u2019 online experiences on our website through concepts of universal design and website accessibility in the design, implementation, enhancement, and replacement of Web content and services. In doing so, the College aims to improve access to both current and emerging technologies. While there is no definitive test or certification that determines whether a website is accessible, we strive to deliver content, like closed-captioning on all of our video tutorials, in accessible formats, because we know that accessible design can reduce and even remove barriers to information and interaction central to success for our faculty, staff, students, and the general public. As such, we are working with web developers to implement strategies to improve access to our website. 2000 W.
