News News A- A+ NACC to Unveil Trouper and Roscoe Statue on May 12th May 03, 2022 Pictured is the rendering of the Roscoe and Trouper statue that will be on display at NACC. Northeast Alabama Community College (NACC) is proud to announce the unveiling of the long-awaited statue featuring the college\u2019s beloved mascots will be held Thursday, May 12, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. on the campus quad. The life-sized bronze statue features two NACC treasures, Trouper the Mustang and Roscoe the Campus Dog, and will memorialize them forever on NACC\u2019s campus. What began as a dream of NACC\u2019s President Dr. David Campbell is now a reality as the statue has been completed. \u201CThis is something we have been wanting to do for a long time,\u201D stated Dr. David Campbell. \u201CWe think the bronze statue will be an unusual feature of the college, even bringing in some visitors and tourists to see it. Beyond that, the statue will symbolize how the Northeast family takes in and nurtures its students and community and makes the campus their home, as they did with Trouper and Roscoe.\u201D The statue was designed by NACC\u2019s Associate Dean of Instructor and talented artist Barbara Kilgore. Kilgore partnered with the University of Alabama\u2019s Sculpture Department and the UA foundry to bring the idea to life. Kilgore\u2019s design places Trouper and Roscoe nose to nose, facing one another. Kilgore felt this was a perfect representation of NACC, saying, \u201CIt occurred to me that Roscoe had chosen us to be a part of his family and that we have chosen Trouper to be a part of our family. I realized that if we were going to have a sculpture that showed the spirit of the institution, it had to include them both. The interaction between the two is one of total acceptance. They are nose to nose, looking at each other. The mood is one of love and respect: the essences of NACC.\u201D Daniel Wallace, friend of NACC and author of Big Fish, also contributed to the statue. Wallace wrote the narrative that is to be inscribed in a plaque describing the statue. Wallace\u2019s eloquent description will allow readers to become more acquainted with both Trouper and Roscoe and remind readers they will always be welcome at Northeast. The administration, faculty, staff, and students of Northeast have anxiously awaited the completion of this statue and are looking forward to the upcoming unveiling. Please join us on campus on Thursday, May 12th, at 10:00 a.m. on the NACC quad for the official unveiling of the statue.
