Services 24-Hour Emergency Response In an effort to provide the best possible emergency services to Samford\u2019s community, the Department of Public Safety maintains a close working relationship with the Homewood Police Department and the Homewood Fire and Rescue Service. Police officers have the shortest response time to any location on campus and are the first responders to incidents on campus. If fire or emergency medical services are needed, police officers will respond to the scene and direct appropriate service units to the exact location of an incident on campus. Patrol and dispatch services are provided 24 hours a day, with immediate access to municipal emergency services. The Department of Public Safety\u2019s radio communications dispatchers cover telephones and two-way radios on a 24-hour basis to give information, respond to emergencies and contact other agencies. Officers and dispatchers can immediately contact the city of Homewood\u2019s fire department, Emergency Medical Service and police department by the Department of Public Safety\u2019s radio system. The Department of Public Safety monitors the National Weather Service radio network. A campus-wide alerting system notifies the campus community of threatening weather conditions. Facility Security Administrative and academic buildings are secured as soon as possible after the offices close or, in the case of a classroom building, after the last class of the day. Through routine patrols, police officers make regular checks of each building to ensure they remain secure until scheduled opening time. Jump Start Batteries The Department of Public Safety will jump-start your battery to assist in starting your vehicle. The department can also help contact a service center or towing service. Law Enforcement Police officers are charged with enforcing the laws and ordinances of the State of Alabama and the City of Homewood. Officers conduct investigations into and document all crimes and offenses committed on Samford University property. Lost and Found A lost and found service for displaced property is provided by the Department of Public Safety. Found property may be turned in at the public safety office so that it may be returned to the proper owner. Nighttime Campus Access Control Gate At 10 p.m. every day, the main gate onto campus is closed and all access on and off campus is made at the Southwest gate. The public safety department maintains a substation at the southwest gate and an officer is posted there from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m. to monitor persons coming on or leaving campus. Individuals entering or departing the campus are subject to security checks for valid identification, campus destination or other relevant information. Residence Hall Security Checks Public safety personnel make routine security checks of the residence halls checking for building safety and security. The Department of Public Safety will respond to all reports of fire alarms and safety hazards. Routine fire drills are conducted by Residence Life for students living in residence halls to familiarize them with emergency evacuation procedures and exit routes from their rooms. Safety Escorts The Department of Public Safety provides a safety escort service for all students to any safe destination on campus during the day or night. The escort service is provided for safety-related reasons only. Because there is safety in numbers, groups of three or more students are encouraged to walk to their destination. The escort is given by either foot or vehicular patrol. Security Patrols The Department of Public Safety continuously patrols the campus with patrol vehicles and foot patrol. The department maintains three vehicles for patrol and escort services. Officers often patrol campus by walking through the quad and building areas. Samford ID Cards Employee ID cards are issued by the Department of Public Safety Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m. Student ID cards are issued by the Samford One Stop. Unlocking Vehicles In most cases, when someone locks their keys inside their vehicle, police officers will open their vehicle for them using a door-unlocking device. For officer safety reasons, the department will not attempt to unlock a vehicle equipped with side impact air bags. If public safety cannot unlock your vehicle, there are several locksmiths in the area who can be contacted to assist you. Blue-light Emergency Phones Blue-light emergency phones are located throughout the campus. When the emergency phone is activated, the Department of Public Safety dispatcher is automatically alerted, and an officer is sent to the location of the telephone. No dialing is required. The person activating the phone should try to describe the emergency in as much detail as possible to the dispatcher.
