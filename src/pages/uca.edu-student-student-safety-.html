The department offers many services to protect members of the campus community. For information about police services, check their website at www.ucapd.com\/. There are many things you can do as a student to maximize your safety at UCA. These include the following \u2013 Lock your room door at all times, even if you are simply going down the hall or to the restroom. Do not prop open exterior residence hall doors. Exterior doors are normally locked twenty-four (24) hours a day for your safety. Do not allow strangers to enter residence halls or apartment complexes. Walk in well-lighted areas and with friends at night. If you desire, UCA police will escort you on campus. Keep books and other valuable items with you at all times. Book thefts can be a problem, especially at the end of each semester. Write your name and student ID number on the same page of each textbook so your books can be traced in case they are stolen. Write down serial numbers of your valuable possessions (computers, TVs, stereo, etc.). Store this information in a safe place. You can also register your possessions through the Operation ID program by going to www.ucapd.net\/index.php\/safe-uca\/safety-programs\/operation-id. Lock your vehicle and keep valuable belongings out of sight. Refrain from or minimize your use of alcohol. Alcohol plays a significant role in date rapes, fights and battery incidents, vehicle accidents, and other serious behaviors. To prevent vehicle accidents\u2026 Do not drink and drive or ride with individuals who consume alcohol. Refrain from driving late at night or when feeling tired or sleepy (sleep deprivation plays a role in many traffic accidents). Refrain from using cell phones and sending text messages when driving. Obey speed limits. Wear a seat belt. Be careful with whom you associate with. If your friends are involved in criminal activity, it increases your chances of getting hurt, becoming a victim, or even a suspect in a crime. Contact UCA Police or residence hall staff immediately if you witness or are the victim of a crime. We encourage parents to have conversations with their sons and daughters about these common sense ideas on campus safety.
