Students must meet the following conditions to be considered for an incomplete grade: Talk to your high school instructor to discuss a plan of completing your course work. Coursework must be completed within one month of the date the incomplete contract is submitted.

At the time of the incomplete request, the concurrent student must be in compliance with all course requirements as outlined in the course syllabus, including attendance requirements. It is up to the instructor to approve an incomplete grade request. Instructors may deny an incomplete request even if a student meets the minimum requirements outlined above. A concurrent student may be required to submit documentation of the reasons the student is not able to complete the coursework. If the work is not completed within the time on the incomplete contract, a grade of \u201CF\u201D will be assigned to the course on the student\u2019s permanent SEARK College transcript.
