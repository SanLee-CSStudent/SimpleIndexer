If students are to succeed in life, they must be able to write and speak effectively. Employers consistently rate good communication skills among the most desirable qualities of their employees. The Communication Arts courses are designed to help students develop and refine these vital skills. Reading makes a full person, writing an exact one, and conversation a ready one. Sir Francis Bacon, Multidisciplinary Scholar-Writer-Scientist-Statesmen Communication Arts courses cover all facets of effective communication: writing, speaking, reading, listening, researching, illustrating, and more. Recognizing connections in what we hear, what we read, and what we write is more important than ever in a fast-paced world where there is so much new to learn. Ultimately, our goal is that each of the elements of this course will enable you to be a more articulate, fully-rounded person who is ready to participate in and contribute to the important conversations in your own life and in society as a whole.
