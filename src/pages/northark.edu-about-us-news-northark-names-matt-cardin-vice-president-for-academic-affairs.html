When Randy Esters left to return to Louisiana to continue his career last May, Dr. Rick Massengale was promoted to serve as the next president, leaving a vacancy for the Vice President of Academic Affairs (VPAA). At the September meeting, Trustees approved a search committee recommendation for Dr. Matt Cardin of Mountain Home, AR to step into that role. Cardin will serve as Northark\u2019s chief academic officer and brings what he calls a \u201Crelational\u201D leadership style to the job. During a campus forum he said meeting employees will be an immediate priority. Dr. Cardin holds a B.A. in Communication from University of Missouri-Columbia, an M.A. in Religious Studies from Missouri State University, and a Ph.D. in Leadership from University of the Cumberlands, Williamsburg, KY. He currently serves as a Doctoral Cohort Coordinator for the John E. Roueche Center\u2019s Community College Leadership Program based out of Kansas State University. Prior to this position, he was Vice President of Accreditation and Institutional Effectiveness for two years at Ranger College in Ranger, TX, after being promoted from Associate Vice President of Instruction for a year. Dr. Cardin was selected as the Ranger College 2018 Employee of the Year and was included in the 2004 edition of Who\u2019s Who among America\u2019s Teachers. He has been the subject of a feature profile for his writing and teaching career in Waco Today magazine and was a nominee for the 2015 World Fantasy Award and preliminary finalist for the 2017 Bram Stoker Award. He is a member of the Golden Key International Honor Society. \u201CMatt brings expertise in several areas to the College,\u201D said Northark President Rick Massengale. \u201CHe excelled as an instructor, then became an administrator who is tuned into student success. He is well-versed in program review and development, strategic planning, and accreditation. We\u2019re glad he returned to this area to be near his family and we\u2019re proud he\u2019ll be a Pioneer.\u201D Dr. Cardin's first day is September 13, and he is excited about the opportunity to join the Northark team. \"I'm delighted to be here,\" he said. \"Northark is such a strong college, and such a valuable presence in Harrison and the surrounding area. It's an honor to be selected for this position. I look forward to helping Northark's continued growth and success as a student-centered institution that improves people's lives.\" In addition to his career in education, Dr. Cardin is a published author, an editor, and a pianist with a 30-year background in church music. He and his wife, Teresa, have a grown son, a daughter-in-law, and twin grandsons. The Cardins are no strangers to the Harrison area. Matt's father's side of the family is from Arkansas, and Matt and Teresa both hail from Southwest Missouri and visited Arkansas frequently while growing up. In the 1990s they lived in Branson, where he worked as a videographer in the shows, including a year at the Grand Palace and two years as the video director at Glen Campbell's theater.
