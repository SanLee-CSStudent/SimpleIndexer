Legacy Giving Options Those that have included the UCA Foundation as a benefactor of their estate or one of the many options of legacy giving are members of the Doyne Society. Learn more about the Doyne Society here. Stocks and Securities Compared with donating cash or selling your appreciated stock and securities and contributing the after-tax proceeds, you may be able to increase your gift and your tax deduction by donating long-term appreciated stock, bonds and mutual funds directly to the UCA Foundation. Learn more about delivery instructions. Please email Chad Hearne at foundation@uca.edu or call (501) 450-5288 with any questions. Real Estate You may donate a house, vacation property, undeveloped land, farmland or commercial property as a great gift. Insurance If you have a life insurance policy that has outlasted its original purpose, consider making a gift of it. For example, you may have purchased a policy to provide for minor children and they are now financially independent adults. Unused Retirement Assets Donating part or all of your unused retirement assets such as a gift from your IRA, 401(k), 403(b), pension or other tax-deferred plan is an excellent way to make a gift.
