The world's biggest problems will be solved through the collaboration of faculty, staff, and students in a variety of academic fields. The College is dedicated to developing and supporting these efforts. The Interdisciplinary Innovation Forums provide opportunities for faculty members across the UAB campus to network with each and with external entities to promote innovation, transformation, and excellence in our research programs. Participating faculty come from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Schools of Education, Business, Engineering, Health Professions, Medicine, Optometry, Dentistry, and Public Health. Other participants come from the UAB Research Foundation (UABRF) and Birmingham Business Alliance (BBA). Be a Part of the Future The College is now soliciting Interdisciplinary Team Proposals. Available awards will be valued at up to $30,000 for a maximum duration of up to one year. Participation is a key ingredient to the future success of the forums. Presentations and other materials from past forums are available on this site. Researchers are invited to propose future topics for discussion and research. Interdisciplinary Innovation Team Proposals The College of Arts and Sciences organizes monthly innovation forums to focus on some of the world's biggest problems where interdisciplinary innovations could have a significant impact and where UAB has existing strengths\/interests. These interdisciplinary innovation forums are held in collaboration with faculty from the Schools of Business, Dentistry, Engineering, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing, Optometry, and Public Health, as well as representatives of the UAB Research Foundation and the Birmingham Business Alliance. Phase I of this initiative are the monthly innovation forums, which will continue into the future. As part of Phase II, the College is now issuing a call for interdisciplinary team proposals. Available awards will be valued at up to $30,000 for a maximum duration of up to one year. An application guideline is available for download.

The Haddin Forum is an interdisciplinary forum where UAB College of Arts and Sciences faculty present their ongoing research and scholarship to an audience of faculty, staff and student colleagues from across the College. The goal is to offer scholarship that is interdisciplinary and translatable to a broad audience, celebrating and elevating the intellectual vibrancy present in the academic atmosphere of a College of Arts and Sciences. Speakers generally share their research for about 40 minutes and allow 20 minutes for interdisciplinary intellectual exchange and questions and answers. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we opened each session with lunch and informal discussion. This practice will be re-initiated when safe to do so. Faculty interested in proposing to deliver a lecture during the 2022-2023 academic year should submit an abstract of their proposed presentation (300-600 words) by 5 pm on Wednesday, August 31, 2022. Proposals should be submitted to Associate Dean John K. Moore, Jr. at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. . The Dean\u2019s Office will review all submissions and select proposals that best reflect the diversity of the College. Priority will be given to junior faculty members, to faculty members from departments that have not offered presentations in the past two years, to topics of broad and timely interest, and to proposals that might appeal to an interdisciplinary audience of individuals. Presentations that cover more than one field of inquiry, inspire novel or renewed dialogue between disciplines, and\/or address content that impact our daily experience, our intellectual lives, and our varied communities are hallmarks of the Haddin Forum.
