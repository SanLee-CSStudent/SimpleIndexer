They provide a path to medical, dental, or optometry school while offering undergraduate students maximum flexibility in exploring the humanities, neurosciences, social sciences, or any other major. The three programs are commonly referred to as EMSAP although they include both dental and optometry school. EMSAP is not an accelerated BS\/MD program; students are expected to spend four years at UAB as an undergraduate and an additional four years in medical, dental, or optometry school. Students can only apply for EMSAP during their senior year of high school. After successful completion of program requirements and graduation from an undergraduate program at UAB, EMSAP assures highly motivated undergraduates admission to the UAB Heersink School of Medicine, UAB School of Dentistry, or UAB School of Optometry. Students applying for EMSAP should note that it is their responsibility to submit all materials by midnight on November 15, including teacher recommendation letters. We suggest that you check, well in advance, with the persons writing your letters to ensure their submission.
