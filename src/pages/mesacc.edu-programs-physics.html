Field of Interest Do you want to be on the cutting edge of scientific ideas and technology? If so, consider a career in physics. This branch of science is concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. From the subatomic to the cosmological, physics seeks to reveal and explain the splendors of the universe. Our Physics program is designed to provide you with the first two years of a four-year curriculum if you wish to specialize in physics or are preparing to apply for professional graduate programs in various medical fields. Experienced instructors will teach you how to describe, predict, and explain real-world phenomena, utilizing a variety of different representations like mathematical, graphical, and pictorial formalisms. You\u2019ll learn how to collect and analyze experimental data, and then draw reasonable conclusions to both develop and support the laws of physics. You\u2019ll also be able to apply the principles of physics to solve problems both inside and outside the classroom. There is a wide range of career paths depending on whether you pursue a bachelor\u2019s or graduate degree in physics \u2014 like teaching, medicine, intellectual property or patent law, science writing, science policy, energy policy, government, and management in technical fields. Join the Physics program and take the first step toward accelerating your career. Transfer Degree Want to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree?
