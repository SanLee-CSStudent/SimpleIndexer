When he\u2019s not in class or managing his new business, he\u2019s trading stocks and looking for his next hot venture. Quin Frazier\u2019s best business idea started with cold feet. He was lounging around the house and started tucking his toes into his sweat pants. His brother joked that he needed an adult half-onesie. Frazier, a senior in the Mitchell College of Business, took that idea and ran with it around the world. He and his brother began designing sweat pants with built-in socks that keep your feet warm. They scouted manufacturers and contracted with the YiWu Pretty Clothing Co. of Zhejiang, China. They started selling online and did more than $100,000 in sales last year. \u201CI\u2019ve always been a big dreamer,\u201D said Frazier, who\u2019s majoring in finance at the University of South Alabama. \u201CI\u2019ve always wanted to shoot for the stars, and if you don\u2019t make that, wind up somewhere in the atmosphere. That\u2019s what I live by.\u201D Cozy Toes is just part of his portfolio as student entrepreneur. He just started a full-time job as night clerk for a commodities trading firm in Mobile. During the day, when he\u2019s not in class, he\u2019s trading stocks and looking for his next venture. Some of his business plans have not done so well. He\u2019s lost money on a few projects. A real estate investment also proved disappointing. Frazier calls them humbling experiences and lessons learned. \u201CYou need your ego to get knocked back down ever so often,\u201D he said. \u201CI needed that.\u201D Frazier, 22, never tells people his age during business conversations. He doesn\u2019t want them to think they can take advantage of his youth and inexperience. For more than two years, he communicated online with an apparel manufacturer, the YiWu Pretty Clothing Co. Only recently did the suppliers get a chance to see him during a FaceTime meeting. \u201CThey were astounded,\u201D Frazier said, laughing. \u201CThey were like, \u2018No way. How old are you?\u2019\u201D As a finance student at South, Frazier joined the Jaguar Investment Fund, where students buy and sell real stocks with real money. He took part in programs at the Melton Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. He participated in an Innovation Corps project funded by the National Science Foundation. Jay Hunt, a management instructor in the Mitchell College of Business, taught Frazier in several classes. \u201CHe\u2019s a great student,\u201D Hunt said. \u201CFrom the first time I met him, I knew he was going to be an innovator and set his own path. He\u2019s a mover and goer.\u201D Frazier never lacked confidence at South. He was always talking about markets and opportunities. Hunt remembers the Mitchell College senior teasing him about money he\u2019d made trading a stock during one of his classes. He got a kick out of Frazier calling him Jay, rather than Dr. Hunt. \u201COh, he\u2019s a live wire,\u201D the professor said. As treasurer for the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, Frazier worked closely with Ric Savadra, the chapter adviser at South, who became one of his mentors. \u201CHe\u2019s an exceptional guy,\u201D Savadra said. \u201CI\u2019ve seen hundreds of students come and go, over the last 30 years, and he stands out. He could go out and make a splash in the world.\u201D The fraternity adviser supports many of Frazier\u2019s efforts. He\u2019s also a Cozy Toes customer. \u201CI bought a pair,\u201D Savadra said. \u201CThey\u2019re very comfortable.\u201D Wheeling and Dealing and Hunting Frazier \u2013 Quin is short for Quinton \u2013 grew up in Huntsville, where both of his parents are engineers. His father works for the Army, while his mother has a job with a NASA subcontractor. Their son was different. He never wanted a traditional career. Independence was more important than security. \u201CI realized that from the start,\u201D he said. \u201CI knew I didn\u2019t want to work for someone else.\u201D At Sparkman High School, he played on the basketball team while trying different jobs and money-making ventures. Lots of young men in North Alabama hunt deer for sport and food. Frazier turned the animals he killed into spicy deer jerky that he sold to classmates for $5 a bag. \u201CNobody told me how to do it,\u201D he said. \u201CIt was just trial and error.\u201D Frazier bought and sold products on Amazon and other sites. These included everything from ethernet modems to bone-conduction headphones. After graduation, he joined his older brother Zane at the University of South Alabama, where he began studying business and finance. Frazier enjoys the Jaguar Investment Fund, where MCOB students buy and trade stocks. The fund often outperforms the stock market and is now worth more than $1 million. \u201CThat\u2019s the best thing this school has ever done,\u201D he said. \u201CYou\u2019re doing this with real money. It\u2019s more like a real-world experience.\u201D The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity has been its own learning experience. As treasurer, Frazier has financial responsibilities, which include collecting dues from his classmates. During the coronavirus pandemic, when membership dipped, he had to negotiate rent payments with the University. Fleecy Feet, Cozy Toes For a casual day of classes and trading on his computer, Frazier wears a T-shirts, jeans and a backwards baseball cap. Dressing up is for meetings and interviews. He just a started a new job as night clerk for a trading firm in downtown Mobile. His hours are 3 to 11 p.m. His task is to monitor financial markets and mitigate investor positions as conditions change, which might be less complicated than it sounds. \u201CIt\u2019s a really simple job,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s like a foreign language.\u201D The story of Cozy Toes begins with the Frazier brothers. Quinn was feeling chilly one day, so he tucked his feet into the bottom of his sweatpants. Zane told him he needed to buy a pair of adult half-onesies. The more they thought about it, the better they liked the idea. Athleisure is a growing market. They might find a niche. \u201CI\u2019m always eager for new entrepreneurial opportunities,\u201D Quinn said, \u201Cso my blood was boiling.\u201D When he began market research, he discovered a California company called Feejays that sells sweatshirts with mitts and sweatpants with socks. It now has more than $4 million in annual revenues. Frazier thought there was room for competition. He scouted around for textile manufacturers before dealing with YiWu Pretty Clothing. He decided upon a simple design that would sell for about $15 less than the industry leader. He started thinking about the best name for sweatpants with fleecy feet. \u201CI sat there for days, thinking about Cozy Feet, Comfy Toes or whatever,\u201D he said. \u201CThen my brother said it: \u2018Cozy Toes.\u2019 And I said that\u2019s it, and we were both jumping around and screaming.\u201D The company does most of its sales on Amazon, but Frazier would like to see that change. Challenges include supply chain issues that have troubled so many businesses in recent years. He\u2019s hired South classmates to work with him at different trade shows. Last year, at the Daphne Christmas Extravaganza, he sold $1,800 worth of Cozy Toes in a single day. This year, he hopes to sell a lot more at the Southern Christmas Show, Nov. 10-20, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Frazier has no problem meeting customers and convincing them to buy his sweatpants. He\u2019s a natural salesman. He\u2019s always interested in marketing ideas, investment opportunities and what could become his next venture. \u201CI\u2019m a super-extrovert,\u201D he said. \u201CI love to talk. I love to make connections \u2013 you can never make too many connections in business.\u201D Share on Social Media Archive Search Latest University News Stocks and Socks May 26, 2022 Quin Frazier, a finance student and entrepreneur from Huntsville, is b...
