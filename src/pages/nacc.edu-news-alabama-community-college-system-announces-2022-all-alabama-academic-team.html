This competition is sponsored by Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, USA Today Newspaper, and the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation. Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in American higher education whose mission is to recognize the academic achievement of college students and to provide opportunities for these students to grow as scholars and leaders. The Northeast Alabama Community College selection committee which is composed of one faculty member from each technical and academic division nominated Andrew Aultman and Emily McBee as the two individuals who would represent the College. Emily lives in Grant, Alabama and plans to attend Athens State University and earn a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting. Her goal is to become a certified public accountant. Andrew lives in Grant, Alabama and plans to attend the University of Alabama and earn a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in English. His goal is to teach English abroad and ultimately teach at a university. These two nominees were honored at a special award luncheon at the Hyatt Regency \u2013 Wynfrey Hotel in Birmingham. Each of the College winners received a $1,000 scholarship to attend any four-year college in Alabama. In addition, Emily was a Silver Medal recipient and will receive an additional $1,250 scholarship. Dean Sherie Grace commented, \u201CWe would like to congratulate Andrew and Emily for their outstanding accomplishments. The application process is rigorous and these young people are very deserving of this award. It is a great honor to be selected as the Northeast All-USA\/All Alabama Academic Team winners.
