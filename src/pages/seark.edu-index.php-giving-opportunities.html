The organization is a 501(c)(3) governed by an independent Board of Directors and day-to-day operations are managed by the Director of Development. By supporting the Southeast Arkansas College Foundation, our donors enable us to award more scholarships, address the College\u2019s most important priorities, and transform the futures of individual students and the College as a whole. August 2018, the college formed a SEARK Scholarship Committee. The charge of the Scholarship Committee is to oversee the Foundation scholarships listed below and to ensure the timely and fair disposition of scholarship funds. The committee is also charged with publicizing and soliciting applications and making recommendations to the Foundation Board. The Foundation awards scholarships for the fall, spring and summer semesters throughout each academic year. Alumni, students, parents, faculty, staff, and community members can support the College by attending the SEARK College annual Foundation event; the Southeast Arkansas College Gala. From its humble beginnings, the Foundation has grown into a financially sound and integral part of the college. Contributions may be targeted for a specific area of the donor\u2019s choosing. Donors may also choose to make unrestricted gifts to the college which will be used in the area of most need as determined by the Southeast Arkansas College Foundation. Gifts to Southeast Arkansas College Foundation are tax deductible. When you give to the Foundation, you can be certain that you are helping to ensure quality educational services for many of our students. You are making a difference in a student\u2019s future.
