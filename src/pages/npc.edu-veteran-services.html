Benefit Recipients Must: Advise the NPC veterans certifying official of any change in course adds\/drops\/or degree changes. Attend class and take final exams. Follow Title IV policies. Make satisfactory academic progress. Submit all transcripts from other colleges and universities by the end of your second semester. Complete the mandatory VA orientation. Keep the NPC VA certifying official and VA informed of your correct address and phone number. If the VA recipient withdraws from class(es), the student will receive a \"W\" on the transcript and may have to repay any money received. The VA student must also notify the VA certifying official within one week of the withdrawal. If the student is dropped from the 45th day attendance FTSE roster, the student will receive a \"W\" on the transcript and may owe back any money received after the last day of attendance (LDA). Students receiving VA benefits may not receive a \"W\" grade from their instructor; they will receive an \"F\" grade at the end of the term. Note: If the above requirements are not met, the student will be placed on Academic Probation after one semester of non-compliance. The recipient has the next enrolled semester to attain a cumulative 2.0 GPA or be placed on Academic Suspension from veteran educational benefits.
