Find Your Test Accuplacer Placement Test All incoming students must submit an online application for Admissions, complete Admissions requirements and consult with an assigned advisor for assistance in making the determination whether or not placement testing is required. Preparation\/practice testing is highly recommended prior to sitting for the placement test, which includes multiple-choice questions in math and an essay test to assess writing skills. Some preparation\/practice recommendations are listed below. Please note that this is not a complete listing of practice and review resources. There is no charge for the initial writing and\/or math placement test administration. One retest is allowable for writing, math or both. The Alabama Community College System guidelines allow for ONE retest per academic year with a $10 retest fee, payable upon arrival for the test appointment. Before retesting, a student must confirm subject area resource study materials have been reviewed to assist with test preparation. Preparing well for the initial test often results in better scores which can save both time and money.

If a prior ACT composite score is to be used, Gadsden State must have an official record of the test score. Please note an ACT score is only official when documented on a high school transcript that has been sent to the Admissions and Records Office by the high school, or an ACT score record is sent to Gadsden State by ACT. There is no expiration to the age of the ACT score for applying to Gadsden State\u2019s Health Science Programs. However, those who have not taken the ACT, or do not wish to use a previous ACT score for applying to one of the health science programs can take the ACT National Test (administered at area high schools and colleges on various Saturday dates) or the ACT On-Campus Test (administered at the East Broad Campus test center on various weekday dates). ACT National allows students to select up to four two-year and\/or four-year colleges as recipients of your scores. ACT National test scores are posted to your personal online ACT account, and a score report is mailed to your address on file with ACT. The ACT National test fee is $55. Test information and registration is via ACT.org. Note: ACT National scores do not auto-upload to your Gadsden State student account once received electronically from ACT. It is imperative that you follow up with the Admissions Office two or more weeks after testing to confirm receipt of scores and request posting of your scores to your student account. The ACT On-Campus administered at Gadsden State is strictly limited only to students applying to one of Gadsden State\u2019s Health Science programs (an A# is required). The ACT On-Campus test fee is $60. ACT On-Campus does not allow adding college codes for multiple college recipients. Scores will only be recorded to your Gadsden State student account for review by the College\u2019s health science program advisors. Each test registrant must have a current, up-to-date admissions application on record with Gadsden State or be a currently-enrolled Gadsden State student. ACT On-Campus scores are not posted to your personal online ACT National account nor does ACT create or mail a formal ACT On-Campus score report to the registrant. Gadsden State\u2019s Testing Services office will contact you approximately two weeks after testing via your Gadsden State student email to report your ACT On-Campus scores. Your ACT On-Campus scores will also be posted to your Gadsden State student account in OneACCS. IMPORTANT: ACT requires a 60-day waiting period between taking multiple ACT On-Campus tests otherwise, ACT will void\/cancel the second test score results with no refund. There is no waiting period between taking ACT National tests, or between taking an ACT National and an ACT On-Campus test. Whether choosing to take ACT National or ACT On-Campus, Gadsden State health science program applicants are strongly encouraged to register for ACT at least one to two months prior to the program\u2019s application deadline. If choosing to take ACT National, register only for the test titled ACT, No Writing.
