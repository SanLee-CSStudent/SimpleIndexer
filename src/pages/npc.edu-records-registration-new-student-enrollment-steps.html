STEP 1: Learn About NPC Complete a short, 10-minute pre-registration tutorial that will teach you about the tools and services available to you at NPC. If you are registering ONLY for online courses you do NOT need to complete the steps listed below. Go straight to Online Course Registration. STEP 2: Complete NPC's Application Form ONLINE - Allow 2 business days for your form to be processed. Once you have submitted your application, NPC will send you a Letter of Confirmation to the email address you provided to NPC upon registration. This letter contains information about how to register for classes and includes your student username and password so you can register for classes through MyNPC (student portal) if you wish. STEP 3: Apply for Financial Aid We encourage ALL NPC students to fill out a FAFSA form even if you think you are not eligible for federal student aid assistance. Filling out this form will tell you if you qualify. Go to studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/fafsa and follow the instructions on the site. NPC's Federal School Code is 011862. If you have questions, please contact NPC's Financial Aid Office. STEP 4: Meet with an Adviser An NPC academic adviser can ensure you get started on the right path. They will help you set up a placement test, set up a degree plan and ensure you take the right courses so you don't waste money and time. Advisers are available at every NPC location. See list. STEP 5: Request Transcripts All new students need to have the transcripts from the last school they attended sent to NPC (NOTE: emailed transcripts via a third party are gladly accepted). This could be your high school transcript or the last college you attended. Transcripts must be official and can be sent via 3rd party: Email official transcripts to evaluations@npc.edu OR Transcripts must be placed in a sealed envelope and mailed directly to: Northland Pioneer College Attn. Records & Registration P.O. Box 610 Holbrook, AZ 86025 Once you have completed these steps: You are ready to register for classes!
