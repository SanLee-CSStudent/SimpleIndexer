UAB placed No. 56 for schools in the United States. In addition, U.S. News & World Report\u2019s Best Global Universities listing used a separate methodology to publish the top global universities in 43 subject areas. The subject-specific rankings included 17 programs from UAB based on academic research performance in those subjects. Other subjects ranked include Surgery; Clinical Medicine; Cardiac and Cardiovascular Systems; Endocrinology and Metabolism; Public, Environmental and Occupational Health; Microbiology; Molecular Biology and Genetics; Biology and Biochemistry; and Social Sciences and Public Health. The Best Global Universities rankings focus on schools\u2019 academic research and reputation, not on specific undergraduate or graduate programs, and use data and metrics provided by Clarivate, rather than gathered directly from the institutions by U.S. News. The 2022 edition includes 2,005 schools from more than 90 countries. Ultimately, 1,750 schools were ranked (versus 1,499 ranked last year). Half of the overall ranking is based on citations, a further quarter uses research reputation split into global and regional, and the remaining quarter is generated from international collaborations, publications, books and conferences. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
