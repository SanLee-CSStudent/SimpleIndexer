Proceeds from all purchases stay with the college to support student-related operations. Textbooks Disclaimer In making available the textbook list on this website, the College Store cannot and does not guarantee the books we have listed will actually be the books used for any given course and section; individual instructors can and do make final decisions about course book usage, therefore changes and errors may occur. If your course is not listed, the bookstore has not yet received a request from the instructor. Textbook prices are subject to change without notice. The College Store is responsible for providing textbooks as required or recommended for college classes, both on campus and for outreach facilities. Store management acquires as many used texts as possible for student purchase. The real value of a textbook is obtained in using it for a class. If it can be resold when no longer needed, that is a bonus.
