In 2002, the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry began treating patients in Alabama\u2019s Black Belt communities through a formally organized program. Since then, more than 13,000 patients in this underserved area of the state have received access to care from the school\u2019s vision scientists, doctors and students. \u201CThe Black Belt Adult Eye Care Clinic project has been instrumental in reducing the number of patients suffering loss of vision due to various eye diseases,\u201D said Mary Jean Sanspree, Ph.D., former director and associate scientist of Education and Research in Vision Science Research at UAB. \u201CWe are the bridge between the Black Belt communities and the vision clinics and doctors they need.\u201D Sanspree says the project began when the Vision Science Research Center saw a need for eye care in the Black Belt. The research grant that began the program was from the Centers for Disease Control under the name Rural Alabama Diabetes and Glaucoma Initiative. There was also funding from the Lions International Foundation, Vision Service Plan and Central Alabama Community Foundation. Grants that initially funded the opportunities to provide treatment in the Black Belt resulted in 10,000 patients\u2019 receiving care. Once the grants ended in 2007, Community Eye Care, the outreach arm of the School of Optometry, continued the work in combination with VSRC and grant assistance from the EyeSight Foundation of Alabama until 2012. Currently, small grants as well as various groups and individuals are donating funds that support the program. Since CEC began leading the Black Belt efforts, eye and vision care have been provided to an additional 3,000 patients. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, recent Black Belt Adult Eye Care Clinics occurred one Saturday, eight months out of the year. The team of organizers works with the local Department of Human Resources, health departments, churches and outreach centers to identify the locations in need of vision and eye care. Between 16 and 18 interns and UABSO instructors as well as five to seven other volunteers participate in the outreach events. \u201CThe work begins on Friday afternoons with loading the vans and making sure we have the materials and equipment we need for our local mission trip,\u201D said Janene Sims, O.D., Ph.D., CEC director. \u201CWe usually leave UAB before the sun rises on Saturday mornings, grab breakfast en route, travel more than two hours, reach our destination, unload, set up and begin seeing patients by 9 a.m. Like the Army \u2014 we do more before 9 a.m. than most people do all day.\u201D Shirley Wilson, Ed.S., Black Belt Adult Eye Care clinic project coordinator, usually determines the rotation of the locations, and the CEC clinic coordinator, BB Jefferson, evaluates the school schedule to determine the Black Belt testing dates.

Volunteers explain the findings to the patients and provide handouts on various conditions. They provide feedback to primary care physicians about eye exam findings. Patients are referred for follow-up care, depending on financial need, through Medicare, Medicaid, Alabama Department of Human Resources, Alabama Lions Sight Conservation or physicians within a reasonable geographic region. Without the help of CEC and other organizations, many of these patients would not have any other access to eye specialists or health care. \u201CMany of those we help have viewed the world for years through blurry vision,\u201D Jefferson said. \u201CThe impact is great because the quality of life is changed for the better.\u201D These clinics not only change the patients\u2019 lives for the better but also provide learning opportunities for the students. \u201CHaving the opportunity to care for underserved communities through Black Belt clinics has helped me grow both as a person and as a clinician,\u201D said Sherry Sandri, a rising fourth-year student. \u201CI learned how to work better with a team, how to be resourceful and how to be efficient. It is very rewarding to provide care for patients who normally do not have access.\u201D The near future for Black Belt clinics is in limbo due to COVID-19, in part due to the ever-changing health recommendations. Summer clinics were canceled. \u201CAs things progress back to normal, we hope to continue our work in the underserved areas of Alabama,\u201D Sims said. \u201CI\u2019m hopeful that our current third-year students will be able to participate in this wonderful program and learn what local missions are all about. Mission begins at home, so let\u2019s start here.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
