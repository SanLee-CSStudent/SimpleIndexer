The AAAC provides accurate advisement based on the current catalog, responds to student needs, and targets specific populations for specialized services. Academic advising is viewed as a continuous process of clarification and evaluation with the ultimate responsibility for making decisions about life goals and educational plans resting with the student. Academic advising assists students by helping to identify and assess alternatives and the consequences of decisions. Freshman students beginning classes during a fall semester will initially register at freshman orientation (BAM). You will meet with an advisor from the AAAC during your orientation session who will assist you with advising and registration. Subsequent pre-registration advising sessions while assigned to the AAAC will require an appointment (see the Academic Advising Syllabus for important dates). The Academic Advising and Assistance Center strives to meet each student\u2019s advising needs. Our professional staff works hard to provide knowledgeable and accurate advising assistance to the students. We also make it a priority to provide personalized attention to each student.
