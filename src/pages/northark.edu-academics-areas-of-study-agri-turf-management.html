Faculty Contact Michelle Buchanan Agri and Turf Management Instructor (870) 391-3149 michelle.buchanan@northark.edu \"I was a paramedic for 10 years and had a knee injury. It got a job at Twin Lakes Golf Course to have some sort of income. A couple of weeks in I realized I was hooked. My superintendent at that time was still trying to talk me into staying on the RN path, but I told him this is what I wanted to do. I loved the golf course and the work. He took me under his wing. I was hooked... I can proudly say that I am now the superintendent at Twin Lakes Golf Course and a big part of my success is the turf management program.\" Cory Dicks, turf management student Internships and Apprenticeships North Arkansas College offers internships to students based on their major or course of study.
