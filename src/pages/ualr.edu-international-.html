J-1 Exchange Visitors Immigration & Visas Employment Health Insurance Community Connection Additional Resources Submit A Request Welcome to International Student Services at UA Little Rock! The mission of the Office of International Student Services (OISS) is to actively promote international and intercultural understanding and to cultivate a mutual commitment and support for international education throughout the campus community. Our team serves all incoming and currently enrolled international students and scholars at UA Little Rock, the Bowen School of Law, and the Clinton School of Public Service. Our office provides assistance to prospective international undergraduate applicants, supports current international students and scholars in immigration advising, social, cultural, and academic issues during their stay. In addition, OISS seeks to increase international ambience on campus by identifying and implementing new opportunities between domestic and international students through workshops, collaboration with the International Club for social programs, trips and cultural excursions. Announcement The Office of International Student Services (OISS) is following this guidance closely and working to ensure all UA Little Rock international students, both current and prospective, receive the most up to date information during this unprecedented time. According to the latest guidance, international students will be allowed to attend higher education institutions that adopt a face-to-face or hybrid model. UA Little Rock currently has a hybrid model and is utilizing a number of hybrid courses for the fall term. Because hybrid courses have a face-to-face and an online component, hybrid courses count towards the minimum physical presence requirement for international students. Continuing International Students Continuing international students (F & J students) who are already in the United States and are not enrolled in fully online courses may remain in active status if he or she makes normal progress in a program of study, or are engaged in approved practical training, either as part of a program of study or following completion of a program of study. New International Students New international students (new F & J students) who will attend UA Little Rock this fall will receive updated immigration documents. These updated immigration documents will certify that the university is not operating entirely online, that the student is not taking a wholly online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of classes required to make normal progress in his or her degree program. OISS will indicate this information in the Form I-20 Remarks field in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). OISS will remain in contact with international students, and appropriate offices in Academic Affairs, Athletics, and Student Affairs to continue sharing information as it becomes available. We know international students are concerned about status and OISS is working diligently to make sure all UA Little Rock international students, both incoming and current, receive the most up to date information during this unprecedented time. We appreciate your patience as we navigate and move forward together. If you have questions or concerns, please reach out to us at internationalservices@ualr.edu or 501-916-3566.
