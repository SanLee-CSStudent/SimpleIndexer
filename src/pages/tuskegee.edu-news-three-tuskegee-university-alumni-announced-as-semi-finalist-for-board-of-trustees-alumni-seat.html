News Three Tuskegee University Alumni announced as semi-finalist for Board of Trustees Alumni Seat May 05, 2022 Allen Contact: Kawana McGough, Office of Communications, Public Relations and Marketing Tuskegee University announced three semi-finalists for the alumni trustee vacancy. The finalists include Cornelius L. Allen, Jr. '99, Clinton Timothy Branner II '90, and Natalie D. Knight '01. Beginning May 4, university alumni will be able to cast email or postal ballots for their preferred candidate to fill the upcoming board vacancy. The candidate who receives the most votes will serve a three-year term from 2022-25. The three alumni candidates are: Cornelius L. Allen '99 earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering; he is a Colonel in the United States Army and currently serves as a Commander (project manager) in the U.S. Special Operation Command. Clinton Timothy Branner II '90 earned a bachelor's degree in marketing; he is the associate director for affirmative action programs with Raytheon Technologies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Most recently, Branner served as the alumni trustee from 2019 through 2022. Branner II Natalie D. Knight '01 earned a bachelor's degree in plant and social science; she serves as director of state and local government relations for a lobbying firm, Impact Public Affairs, in Atlanta, Georgia. The three candidates were recommended following a review of nominations by the five-person Ad Hoc Committee on Alumni Trustee Elections, chaired by Faye Haygood '80. With the assistance of the university's coordinator of alumni affairs and reunion programs, the committee recommended nominees to the trustees' Nominating and Board Structure Committee, which narrowed the field to Allen, Branner, and Knight. \"We wish to thank everyone who expressed interest in serving Tuskegee University in this unique way as an alumni trustee,\" said Norma Clayton, chair of the university's Board of Trustees. \"Applying for this opportunity and reviewing the applications we received required much forethought \u2014 and, for that, we appreciate all the alumni who were involved in the stages of this process.\" The process now shifts to the university's entire alumni base. Online voting, administered by Votenet Solutions Inc., begins on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, and ends on Wednesday, May 25. All alumni with email addresses on file with the university will receive an email to that account providing additional instructions on the voting procedures through the eBallot system. Knight The finalist receiving the most votes (a plurality) will then go before the entire Board of Trustees for its consensus. Once the trustees approve the elected finalist for board service, the elected candidate will begin serving as the alumni trustee at this summer's meeting of the Board of Trustees. If you did not receive an online ballot, please email alumnitrustee@tuskegee.edu.
