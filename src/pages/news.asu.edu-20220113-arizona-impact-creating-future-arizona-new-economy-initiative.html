While they worked well for the Grand Canyon State in its first hundred years, the 21st century requires coders and engineers for Arizona to stay competitive and resilient through the type of shocks the past 20 years have dealt. Gov. Doug Ducey and the state Legislature have funded a plan for the state\u2019s three universities to develop a coordinated response to attract high-tech industry, drive job creation and make Arizona families prosperous. It\u2019s called the New Economy Initiative. Its goals are to create 40,000 new high-wage jobs by 2041, increase economic output to $6.9 billion by 2032 and double the return on the state\u2019s investment by the same year. The endgame is to pivot Arizona\u2019s economy away from housing growth and tourism to something that is resilient to economic downturns, pandemics and whatever else the 21st century has in store. Video of ASU New Economy Initiative: Arizona State University (ASU) Video by Ken Fagan\/ASU News \u201CAll of us \u2014 the citizens of the state, the Legislature, the governor, chambers of commerce \u2014 all said, we have to do something and we have to do something collectively,\u201D said Sally C. Morton, the executive vice president of Arizona State University\u2019s Knowledge Enterprise. Morton advances the university\u2019s research priorities and drives corporate engagement, economic development, global initiatives, strategic partnerships and technology transfer on behalf of the university. \u201CAnd the state universities should play a central role in this,\u201D she said. Each university has been given distinct roles to play. Each role aligns to their traditional strengths. Northern Arizona University will expand its capacity to address health care worker shortages in nursing, allied health and mental health education programs. The University of Arizona is launching its \u201COne Health\u201D initiative that leverages the university\u2019s medical, veterinary, engineering and cooperative extension programs to address community and health care needs across the state. And at ASU, engineering will play a very big role, but it\u2019s just one part of the university\u2019s efforts. ASU\u2019s role Knowledge Enterprise is coordinating ASU\u2019s response to the New Economy Initiative. Beyond engineering, the university\u2019s Academic, Learning and Knowledge enterprisesThe Academic Enterprise encompasses everything to do with degree-seeking students and the faculty who teach them. The Learning Enterprise is ASU\u2019s lifelong learning ecosystem, designed for all learners no matter what stage of life (outside of those seeking degrees) \u2014 from kindergartners to mid-career professionals to retired people. The Knowledge Enterprise advances research, corporate engagement, economic development, entrepreneurship, international development and technology transfer. will be involved. Budgeting and tracking dollars, and communicating to the state what the university is doing and the impact it is having, are also important parts of ASU\u2019s effort. The state Legislature is providing $33.4 million in ongoing funding and $18.8 million in one-time funding to ASU for the initiative. The university is doing three things 1. Growing the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. The Fulton Schools have hired 16 more faculty than usual on top of new hires. \u201CThat\u2019s a big number,\u201D Morton said. In addition to hiring new faculty, ASU has been buying equipment, placing it and renovating space for it. The newest acquisition is an atomic layer depositing tool, which allows engineers to deposit materials on a computer chip in a layer as thin as one-millionth of a human hair. It has to be in a clean room 2. Focusing on student success and workforce development. This means training students in skills that are needed in a modern workforce and upskilling existing workers, as well as providing the means for people to move into the new economy. For example: \u201CSomeone in the workforce who thinks, boy, if I could get into microelectronics, I could really support my family better,\u201D Morton said. 3. Building five science and technology centers. They will be physical centers with faculty and students, but also magnets for industry to come and present the most current problem they need solved. \u201CWe solve that with our students, faculty as well as the industry partner,\u201D Morton said. \u201CAnd then together, we push the results out. \u2026 So it kind of focuses the work, if you will.\u201D ASU has already launched two science and technology centers (STC). The MADE (Manufacturing, Automation and Data Engineering) STC focuses on the development of new technologies aimed at transforming manufacturing through 3D printing, robotics and automation, and new materials, with strong links to private industry support in aerospace, defense and space systems. The AMPED (Advanced Materials, Processes and Energy Devices) STC is a national research resource for advancing new energy materials and device technologies in solar, batteries and electronics to market, growing industry engagement and workforce training.

Future Communications will develop physical information systems as the \u201Cinternet of things\u201D continues, and as users increasingly desire greater access, information and reliability in communications. Human Performance will leverage regional, strength and technology opportunities to enhance physical and cognitive performance, medical prevention and intervention, and drive research from discovery to marketplace. \u201CI think of those science and technology centers as sort of the intellectual structure of the NEI,\u201D Morton said. \u201CThe five areas were really based on both the strengths of Fulton Schools of Engineering and also a sense of where technology is going.\u201D Anecdotally, interest is high, according to the reactions Morton gets when she speaks to groups about the New Economy Initiative. \u201CIndustry is really excited,\u201D she said. \u201CI go out and give these talks, and whether they\u2019re virtual or in person I get business cards. People come up to me and say, \u2018That sounds really cool. You know, I\u2019ve got a company in X; how do I get connected to (a science and technology center)?\u2019\u201D Partnerships and collaborations In November 2019, Grace O\u2019Sullivan, ASU\u2019s vice president of corporate engagement and strategic partnerships, traveled with city of Phoenix and state officials to Hsinchu, Taiwan (considered Taiwan\u2019s Silicon Valley), to help attract the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to the Valley. Several months later, the chip giant selected Arizona and announced plans to build a $12 billion chip plant in Phoenix. \u201CThey're bringing thousands of jobs to the Valley and an entire supplier network here,\u201D O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201CThe first thing they did was hire 200-plus engineering student graduates from ASU. And now we\u2019re engaging with them on defining and scoping R&D projects, what the facilities are going to look like. They\u2019re asking us for our curriculum and semiconductor training.\u201D ASU has partnerships and relationships with almost every tech giant in the state: Honeywell, Raytheon, Intel and dozens of others. Sometimes their engineers come to the university for help solving specific problems, like reprogramming a robot. Sometimes they\u2019ll request more grads with specific skills, like 3D printing. It has all been a dry run for the New Economy Initiative. \u201CWe've been really laying the groundwork for many years ahead of time in aligning partners, getting the local community ready,\u201D O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201CFrom my perspective in the university, we\u2019ve been cultivating partnerships like growing our engagements with Intel, SRP, APS, Mayo Clinic, Dignity Health ... \u201D she continued. \u201CNow we have this organizing framework around the New Economy Initiative and our science and technology centers. This is a great way for our industry partners to connect on these really important themes for the new economy.\u201D ASU has secured close to $10 million in grants from the Department of Labor for workforce development. They are focused around IT skills, cybersecurity and advanced manufacturing. The university is creating apprenticeship programs and new models for how people are getting trained in the workforce \u2014 either new talent coming in or existing employees who need to be re-skilled. \u201CWe are working with the state workforce office, municipal workforce offices, the city of Phoenix and our community college partners to create this entire pipeline of the talent that\u2019s needed to feed the future,\u201D O\u2019Sullivan said. Mayo Clinic and ASU have more than 165 jointly appointed members \u2014 those who work at Mayo Clinic and guest lecture or teach part-time at the university. One of ASU's local collaborations is with Mayo Clinic, which has Arizona locations in north Phoenix and Scottsdale. \u201CNow we really want to replicate that model with industry,\u201D O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201CIt\u2019s a model that has a proven track record.\u201D Valley cities are starting to sit up and take notice that ASU makes things they want. The university is in talks with the cities of Peoria and Phoenix on how to design an innovation technology cluster in the northwest Valley. \u201CI think they\u2019ve seen the success that ASU is able to bring to revitalize a region, for example, like in downtown Phoenix,\u201D O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201CWe are now being \u2014 maybe courted is too strong of a word \u2014 asked by cities to come and develop innovation zones or regional hubs in partnership with them.\u201D Upskilling Meredyth Hendricks is head of upskilling within ASU\u2019s Learning Enterprise, the university unit responsible for reimagining how to serve learners across their lifespan. Hendricks leads a team that collaborates with experts across the university to build and scale job-relevant education programs that serve two key purposes: giving learners the skills they need to succeed at every career stage, and providing employers with a more skilled workforce. \u201CWithin the New Economy Initiative, we\u2019re focused on catalyzing Arizona\u2019s workforce to position learners and companies for success in Arizona\u2019s new economy,\u201D Hendricks said. \u201COur goal is to leverage ASU\u2019s assets as a top-tier research university to build education programs that give workers the opportunity to learn in-demand job skills, from foundational professional skills to those related to cutting-edge technologies.\u201D The Learning Enterprise has ambitious program development goals. The first type of programs are highly scalable courses that will reach learners across the state, including those already in the workforce. One initial focus for the team is developing a robust portfolio of courses related to professional skills (sometimes termed \u201Csoft skills\u201D), such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and teamwork. These are rarely taught comprehensively in school, but they\u2019re critical across many roles. \u201CThree out of four employers say that they have difficulty finding employees who have the professional skills their companies need,\u201D Hendricks said. \u201CThis skills gap in the market presents an opportunity for ASU to have an impact. Moreover, these skills are not likely to be automated in the future because they are by nature human skills.\u201D Learning Enterprise will also be leading custom engagements with corporate partners and collaborators, including executive education, working directly with companies to address their specific workforce education goals. \u201CASU faculty and researchers work at the forefront of industry innovation, and the opportunity to partner with Arizona companies to upskill their workforces is exciting. Custom partnerships can range from educating workers with entry-level skills to skills related to the frontier-technology, as that is the focus of the new Science and Technology Centers,\u201D Hendricks said. One example where ASU has already done custom education is with Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic needed help onboarding new schedulers in an online and remote training environment, so it came to ASU. The university helped develop a new onboarding program to train these new hires. Typically ASU\u2019s corporate partnerships are straightforward. Honeywell contacts the Polytechnic campus and lets it know it will need 10 3D printing engineers next year. Next year, the university delivers 10 newly minted engineers. Now, that type of interaction will be greatly expanded. \u201CBy significantly expanding the number of individuals we reach with top-quality, job-relevant education, ASU will help develop the talent Arizona needs to improve its competitiveness.\u201D Hendricks said. \u201CThe state has given us an ambitious assignment, and I think we\u2019re up to the task.\u201D Engineering With nearly 27,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 75 degree options offered on two campuses and online, the Fulton Schools of Engineering is the largest and most comprehensive engineering school in the United States. Administrators of the Fulton Schools see two things as their greatest strength: their students and their faculty. Their plan to advance the New Economy Initiative is to rely on those strengths by beefing up both. Engineering enrollment has skyrocketed at ASU, with undergraduate enrollment rising from more than 6,000 in 2010 to more than 20,000 in 2021. When they graduate, they move into companies and they start companies. Because ASU is a research university, the faculty work on the cutting edge of technology. Think white lasers, medical devices and prosthetic limbs that can feel. Students are immersed in it, interning in industry or performing tasks like reprogramming a robot arm that a Raytheon supplier couldn\u2019t complete, through the eProjects program. A group of engineering students helped resurrect a Raytheon robotic arm in 2018. Raytheon delivered the non-working deburring robot to ASU in hopes that it could reprogram the device after the former integration company failed. In the 60-day time frame, engineering students were able to program, run and test the massive arm. Photo by Charlie Leight\/ASU News \u201CThey find translational pathways,\u201D said Kyle Squires, dean of the Fulton Schools. \u201CThey connect into industry partners that basically help industries see the horizon of where their industry sector\u2019s headed. It de-risks that process. It basically brings us into it. And that\u2019s something universities are uniquely able to do. ASU has really leaned into that. I think that\u2019s one area where ASU really has a competitive advantage. We can scale that through the NEI.\u201D ASU is hiring new faculty to support the New Economy fields and themes \u2014 most notable recently in materials sciences. Squires expects not only that ASU faculty will work with industry, but that industry will participate at ASU. \u201CThey might be a practicing engineer at Intel or Boeing or whatever,\u201D Squires said. \u201CAnd they teach a class once a year, maybe twice a year, whatever. How do we fortify that structure so that if you are that double-E (electrical engineering) PhD, and we\u2019ve been connecting with you for quite some time around some topic in teaching or research or whatever the case. What if you were to scale that and think about it broadly? What does that look like?\u201D The ideas being catalyzed by the state\u2019s investment were directions ASU has been moving in for some time. \u201CThis is not some new, crazy wild idea,\u201D Squires said. \u201CThis is a really important direction. Now we can accelerate. We can scale. We can increase the rate of faculty hires, and that\u2019s good on the institution because the direction makes sense.\u201D Arizona is primed for prosperity. \u201CThat\u2019s owing to ASU,\u201D Squires said. \u201CThat's owing to all the partners in the Valley now to get to that next level. I can\u2019t overstate it. This is the moment that we need to catalyze that transformation to that next level \u2014 that kind of really genuinely dynamic economies that we see around the country.\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s a great example of the role that public universities can play to serve our communities and just wonderful that the state has come together in this way to say we need to change this,\u201D Morton said. \u201CWe need to change this for the future for the state and moving forward.\u201D Top image of downtown Phoenix by Deanna Dent\/ASU News Arizona Impact Ira A.
