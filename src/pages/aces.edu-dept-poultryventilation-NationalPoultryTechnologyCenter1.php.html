They drive ventilation fans, heater blowers, stir fans, feed bin and feed line augers, lift systems for feed and water lines, and actuators for tunnel and vent doors. A two-house (66 ¡¿ 600 feet each) poultry farm, for example, has over 80 electric motors comprised of 48 fan motors, 16 feed line auger motors, 4 feed fill auger motors, 4 tunnel door\/curtain machine motors, 4 vent machine motors, and others. We see and hear of the challenges producers face in swapping out electric motors (figure 1) when they \"go bad\" and stop working. The cost of replacing a farm motor can range between $200 and $500-plus depending on the type of motor, size, and brand name. The motor can take 1 to 2 hours to replace depending on how easy it is to remove attached equipment, such as pulleys and shafts, and rewire and attach the new motor.

NPTC Tools of the Trade: Testing a Motor Capacitor Learn the necessary steps to properly test a motor capacitor on the farm. Before testing can begin, you need to gather the necessary tools to perform a capacitor test: Electrical multimeter with modes to test continuity and capacitance. Continuity will be identified as a sound logo, and capacitance will be identified with a capacitor logo (-||-) on the multimeter dial. Capacitance meter to check the capacitance of a start or run capacitor. Multi-tool driver or set of sockets to open the capacitor housing on the motor. Insulated pliers to remove the spade connectors from the capacitor tabs and to hold the discharge resistor. Electrical resistor (15 to 20k Ohm) to dissipate the electrical charge of the capacitors. An electrically insulated screwdriver is used by electricians to discharge the capacitor, but it is not a recommended method. Soldering iron (electric or gas pen) to remove and reattach a bleed-off resistor if attached to the start capacitor.

As we repair or add on to our existing water supply systems, we often don't think about the types of fixtures and valves we use. We often choose replacement valves from what is available on the farm or what is cheapest from the supply store. This publication provides information for making educated choices for your poultry house plumbing. In the summer months, water capacity always becomes a concern for commercial broiler growers as bird consumption and evaporative cooling systems tax farm water supplies. As we repair or add on to our existing water supply systems, we often don't think about the types of fixtures and valves we use. We often choose replacement valves from what is available on the farm or what is cheapest from the supply store. Figure 1 shows the water panel of a 40-by-500-foot commercial broiler house with yellow arrows highlighting 15 valves or hose bibs. This manifold has 10 PVC and 3 brass ball valves and 2 brass quarter-turn hose bibs, which begs the question: is it safe to assume that the flow rate out of these valves is the same?

Mission: Improve bottom line profitability of the live production sector of the US poultry industry by providing timely applied research and education resulting in increased efficiencies in housing, equipment, energy and environmental control. Poultry housing, energy, ventilation, economics, and management problems are usually intertwined and very complex. In trying to find solutions to these major grower and industry problems, we at Auburn University have successfully used a teamwork approach for several years. The Auburn NPTC Poultry Housing Team collaborating in this work includes Jeremiah Davis - Director & Research Ag Engineer, Jesse Campbell - Poultry Housing Specialist, Kelly Griggs - Research Engineer II. Feel free to contact any team member if you have questions relating to their areas of expertise. Please note, however, that team members cannot provide design recommendations or diagnose specific problems through email.
