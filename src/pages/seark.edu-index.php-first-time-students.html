These scores are used for placement in English, Math, and Reading according to the following guidelines: Students who have not scored 19 or above on the English, Math, and Reading portions of the ACT (or have not taken the ACT), must take the Accuplacer exam for placement. If you have not taken the ACT exam, sitting for the ACCUPLACER test is the easiest. The test is given in the Intake Testing Center located in room 142 of the Student Services Building. Please call the Intake Testing Center at 870-850-4801. Official copy of your high school transcript or GED tests scores. Transfer students who have attended another college or university are required to furnish official transcripts when applying for admission.
