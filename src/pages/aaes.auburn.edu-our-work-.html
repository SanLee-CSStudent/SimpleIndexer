Our heart at AAES has always been our work focusing on scientific investigation and research to solve long-range problems. The Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station was established in 1883 through an act of the Alabama Legislature to conduct scientific research that would advance the state\u2019s agricultural and forestry industries. With the future in mind, AAES is meeting the constantly increasing challenges and demands on the agriculture enterprise with a steady infusion of new information, knowledge, methods, and technology that can only be provided through agricultural research. Results increasing yields in countless examples of collaborative projects have collectively had a great impact on agricultural productivity in Alabama and around the world.
