Student Spotlight From current students: \"I came to Lyon thinking that my exposure to the music department would begin and end with the marching band and concert band. However, the more time I spent there, the more involved I got until I changed my intended major all together. The music department is close-knit, a family. Not only are you experiencing music in all its forms, but you are being supported by the people within it. They only want you to get better and enjoy the craft. I couldn't see myself anywhere else.\" - Daria Giles, \u201823 Interesting Places Employers and careers of recent Lyon College Music Graduates include: City Year, musical theatre singer\/director, jazz pianist, K-12 music educators, music studio owners, church music directors, and church organists Additionally, Lyon College Music Graduates move on to prestigious graduate schools including: University of Memphis, Arizona State University, University of Kansas, Arkansas State University, and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary For more information on the required courses for a Music major or minor, view our courses page.
