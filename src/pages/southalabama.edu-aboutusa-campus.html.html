The Glenn Sebastian Nature Trail contains more than three miles of trails that wind through 95 acres of native pine and oak woodlands. In addition to the main campus and USA Health locations, South offers classes at its Baldwin County and Gulf Shores campuses. Art and Architecture The USA main campus is home to dozens of works of public art, many of them part of the Gwin Sculpture Collection, which includes \u201CGridiron\u201D at the football field house, \u201CEinstein\u201D at Shelby Hall, \u201CSouthPaw\u201D in front of Alumni Hall, and \u201COld Man and the Sea\u201D beside the Humanities Building. More than 50 sculptures comprise Geri Moulton Children\u2019s Park, located in a wooded setting along the entrance drive to USA Health Children\u2019s & Women\u2019s Hospital. In addition, there are three historic houses which were moved to campus and saved from destruction. The Theophilus Toulmin Creole House, circa 1828, is one of the oldest structures in Mobile County. The University Honors College is housed in the Seamen\u2019s Bethel, built in the 1860s. The Marx House is considered among Mobile\u2019s finest examples of mid-19th century townhouse design. Signature Facilities The Mitchell Center, a 10,000-seat multipurpose arena, is home to the Jaguar men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams and the University\u2019s commencement ceremonies. The center regularly offers an array of entertainment including theatrical presentations, concerts and exhibitions. The John W. Laidlaw Performing Arts Center is a cultural hub and a training ground for students from the department of music and the department of theatre and dance. Three performance spaces\u2014a 240-seat recital hall, 184-seat main stage theater and 60-seat black box theater \u2014 provide a continual slate of dance, music and theatrical performances. The Gordon and Geri Moulton Tower and Alumni Plaza is the most visible landmark and a site of enduring memories. The open-air plaza is a popular gathering place for festivals, homecoming, graduation ceremonies and frequent photo ops with the Jaguar statue. The 140-foot high brick-and-stone tower features authentic bronze bells and an electric carillon. The Alfred and Lucile Delchamps Archaeology Building serves as both a public museum of ancient artifacts and a resource for the USA Center for Archaeological Studies. Covering 12,000 years of prehistory and history, the museum has collected over one million artifacts, some of which are showcased in life-size scenic representations depicting ancient cultures. The Student Center is the center of activity on campus. It is home to the Food Court, the Bookstore and the USA Mail Hub, as well as the Student Government Association.
