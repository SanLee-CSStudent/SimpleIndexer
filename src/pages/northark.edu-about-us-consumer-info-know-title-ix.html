Title IX does not apply to female students only Schools must be proactive in ensuring that your campus is free of sex discrimination. Schools must have an established procedure for handling complaints of sex discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual violence. Schools must take immediate action to ensure a complainant-victim can continue their education free of ongoing sex discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual violence. Schools may not retaliate against sometime filing a complaint and must keep complainant-victim safe from other retaliatory harassment behavior. Schools can issue a no contact directive under Title IX to prevent the accused student from approaching or interacting with you. In cases of sexual violence, schools are prohibited from encouraging or allowing mediation (rather than a formal hearing) of the complaint. Schools cannot discourse you from continuing your education since you have a right to education under Title IX.Title IX Contacts at Northark Title IX Coordinator \u2014 Doug Gere, 870-391-3204 Title IX Deputy Coordinators \u2014 Kris Greening, 870-391-3215, Kim Brecklein, 870-391-3338; Seychelle Mahoney, 870-391-3286; Sheila Ogier, 870-391-3291; Scott Howie, 870-391-3513; Mandy Moore, 870-3913531, Michelle Byler, 870-391-3130; and Jennifer Scott, 870-391-3153.
