Program Give UNCF Golf Select Page Honors Program Blessings & Breakthroughs: Highlights of the October 2021 Board Meeting Oakwood University launched its Honors Program in the fall of 2020 with a select cohort of 28 scholars. The program affords academically gifted students an enhanced learning experience through: Interdisciplinary team projects Internships Enhanced curricula for general education courses Leadership development Service opportunities Formal research projects ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Admission to the OU Honors Program is subject to the following requirements: High school GPA minimum of 3.7 A minimum score of 1150 on the SAT or 25 on the ACT A robust high school transcript that includes: precalculus or calculus physics or at least one AP or college dual enrollment course Note: No single course can satisfy more than one requirement. Recognizing that a single academic metric may not accurately predict a student\u2019s success in the Honors program, students can qualify for the program by meeting at least two of the three admission requirements. TEAM PROJECTS Team projects will allow interdisciplinary groups of students to work together to solve real-world problems. The teams will work outside the traditional classroom setting with the guidance of a project advisor. Projects will reflect the values of Oakwood University as an HBCU and a Seventh-day Adventist institution. The project categories include: Public Health Humanitarian Educational Disparities Environmentalism Social Justice Project teams will have an opportunity to present their solutions to a panel of faculty evaluators at a research symposium near the end of the sophomore year. INTERNSHIPS All Honors scholars will have opportunities to apply and grow their knowledge while participating in research or corporate internships. This will provide students with valuable experience and competitive compensation. A minimum of one internship is required for graduation. RESEARCH PROJECT A dynamic aspect of the Honors program is the exposure it provides students to the formal research enterprise. The research curriculum includes: Orientation on information literacy and best research practices Research project & thesis Thesis presentation Honors scholars will present their thesis as a capstone requirement for graduation. The thesis will also be filed with the Eva B. Dykes Library to facilitate greater access. SERVICE & LEADERSHIP Honors scholars will also grow through participation in service activities and leadership assignments. These experiences will increase their value proposition when matriculating to graduate programs or professional employment. HONORS PROGRAM BENEFITS Some benefits that Honors scholars will receive include: Dedicated living accommodations Curriculum vitae that includes leadership, service, team projects, and formal research Premier library services Information literacy orientation & research consultation Collaborative workspaces Dedicated online resources Extended material loan periods Special distinctions at graduation and on transcripts that improve competitiveness for graduate school and employment opportunities MORE INFORMATION For more information, please contact Brandon Dent, Honors Program Director Brandon Dent, BSE, MSE, CPM Honors Program Director Assistant Professor of Mathematics bdent@oakwood.edu 256.726.7351 7000 Adventist Boulevard, NW Huntsville, Alabama 35896 Resources Center for Student Success Disability Support Services Apply CARE program OU Honors Program Steering Committee Marcya Burden, J.D.\/LLM Associate Professor and Pre-Law Program Director Department of History and Political Science mburden@oakwood 256.726.8371 7000 Adventist Boulevard, NW Huntsville, Alabama 35896 Karen Benn-Marshall, Ed.D Assistant Provost of Undergraduate Education Interim Dean of Health Professions (256) 726-7005 kmarshall@oakwood.edu Lisa James, Ph.D Chair and Associate Professor Department of Mathematics & Computer Science (256) 726-7270 ljames@oakwood.edu Kenneth LaiHing, Ph.D Professor and Dean, School of Arts and Sciences (256) 726-8463 laihing@oakwood.edu Gilbert Ojwang, Ph.D Professor and Chair, Department of Religion & Theology (256) 726-7385 gojwang@oakwood.edu Chandra T.
