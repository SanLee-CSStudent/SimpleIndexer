Though she didn\u2019t know she would \u201Cfall into law\u201D when she earned her degree at Birmingham-Southern, she still sees the impacts of her undergraduate education throughout her life. \u201CWe were held to a standard that we were expected to hold to in life,\u201D she says. \u201CProfessors expected us to participate, and you had to be prepared. Classes exposed you to different personalities and people from all walks of life.\u201D Weston-Pickens\u2019 campaign launch party in March 2018. Judge Weston-Pickens took night classes at BSC and received her degree in human resources management through an evening program once offered at the College. She left the Hilltop as a first-generation college graduate, which she achieved all while working full time at Southern Company. She also earned her Juris Doctor from Miles College Law School through night classes, even when she was commuting to Alabama Power\u2019s Clanton office during the day. \u201CI\u2019d never thought about law school before,\u201D she says. \u201CSometimes it takes your own self and knowing you can do it yourself, and with who you surround yourself with.\u201D After she earned her law degree and passed the bar, Judge Weston-Pickens transitioned from her nearly 16-year career at Southern Company \u2013 where she worked in human resources and real estate \u2013 to her work as a managing attorney for her own private practice before the district judge seat opened. Due to the switch in her seat in 2020, Judge Weston-Pickens has served as a judge in both criminal court and civil court. Now, she judges small claims cases for constituents across Jefferson County. She views her role through the lens of the community around her \u2013 something she has kept since building relationships through her campaign. \u201CYou work for the people \u2013 that\u2019s who elected me and who I work for,\u201D she says. \u201CI allow them to ask questions, and I try to be approachable but stern when I need to be. It can be nerve-wracking to be in a courtroom in front of a judge.\u201D This is where Judge Weston-Pickens\u2019 empathy comes in, helping her be a fair judge to her constituents. As a criminal attorney, she held to the fact that everyone deserves the best representation, and she brings the same mindset in hearing and researching cases and dedicating herself to her community. \u201CI think we make a difference,\u201D Judge Weston-Pickens says. \u201CEven while I was running for my position, I didn\u2019t think of myself as a politician. It\u2019s about giving back, not about power. It\u2019s about serving the community where I grew up and how I can impact people. That\u2019s what I hope to do.\u201D This story was included in a special law edition of From the Hilltop, Birmingham-Southern\u2019s alumni email newsletter.
