University Audit and Risk Management UNIVERSITY AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT University Audit & Risk Management (UA) provides independent, objective reviews and assessments of the business activities, operations, financial systems, human resources, and internal accounting controls of Tuskegee University in an effort to add value and improve the University's operations. UA furnishes management with objective, timely and accurate analysis; develops recommendations; counsels; and provides information regarding the University\u2019s activities. Audits are performed in all areas of the University, and UA has full and complete access to all records, physical properties, and personnel relevant to the audit process. The UA aims to help the University accomplish its objectives by bringing a 21st century systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of risk management, control, and the governance processes. In addition, the UA seeks to employ best practices in higher education management and administration as well as utilize effective and transparent lines of communication throughout the University. UA also intends to aid the University in strengthening its institutional capacity and sustainability by reviewing and managing the adherence of all personnel to institutional policies and procedures and increase managerial accountability. CONFIDENTIALITY All information obtained during an internal audit is deemed confidential unless otherwise instructed. It is understood that certain items are confidential in nature and special arrangements may be required when examining and reporting on such items. UA will handle all information obtained during a review in the same prudent manner as the original custodian of the information. UA respects the value and ownership of information received and will not disclose information without appropriate authority unless there is a legal or professional obligation to do so. Audit reports are considered highly confidential. They are distributed to the respective area Vice President, the President, and the Audit Committee as requested. Other individuals interested in the audit report may gain access by contacting the Chief Audit Executive, with the approval of the appropriate area Vice President. UA is expected to remain prudent with all information obtained during the course of an audit. When discussing matters pertaining to an audit or any other University matters, UA must always remain discreet and be certain to limit those conversations exclusively to appropriate University personnel. UA has an obligation to never indiscreetly discuss any information obtained during the course of audit assignments, whether within or outside the University. ANONYMOUS REPORTING HOTLINE Tuskegee University has established a whistleblower hotline through Lighthouse Services, Inc. for the purpose of reporting fraud, unlawful, unethical, and other types of improper behavior. A more complete description of the purpose of this policy is available in the University\u2019s Whistleblower Protection and Investigation and Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Policies. The hotline is not a substitute for routine communications within the University between associates and their supervisors and managers, particularly as to workplace duties. Likewise, it does not replace communications with Human Resources about benefit issues or other job-related issues. Regular business matters that do not require anonymity should be directed to the employee\u2019s supervisor and should not be submitted using this service. Any Tuskegee University Board member, officer, faculty member, staff employee, contract employee, temporary or term employee, student, volunteer, consultant, and vendor (each a \u201CCovered Person\u201D) who believes they are aware of fraud, unlawful, unethical and\/or other types of improper behavior are expected and encouraged to report their concerns. Covered Persons have many ways in which they can report a concern or incident. They may discuss it with their manager, the Chief Audit Executive and\/or General Counsel. Covered Persons may also contact Lighthouse Services through this site or by using the following other methods: Anonymous Reporting App (located in the Apple App\/Google Play store) Keyword: Tuskegee Telephone: 855-222-2594 E-mail: reports@lighthouse-services.com (must include company name with report) Fax: (215) 689-3885 (must include company name with report) **Such reports may be made confidentially and anonymously.
