Application Deadline It is recommended that you submit your Graduate School application at least one month prior to the semester you wish to start. Three months prior to your starting semester is preferable. Although every effort will be made to accommodate late applicants, there is no guarantee that a late application will be accepted and\/or able to enroll in desired classes. Some programs have firm application deadlines that may be up to one year prior to starting the program, so check the graduate bulletin for program deadlines. Application Fee Waivers Application fee waivers are available for applicants who are veterans or dependents of veterans. To be eligible for the veteran application fee waiver, you must submit a DD-214 with the application. This document is proof of active duty status, retirement, separation, or discharge from active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States. This will be identified in the lower section of the DD-214 Member 4-copy. It will say (Honorable). If the form states something other than honorable, you are not eligible for a waiver. If a service member is still currently on Active Duty they must submit a letter from their Commanding Officer stating the status of duty. Immunization Records \u2013 Students who plan to attend UCA must provide proof of immunizations. In order to register for classes, these immunizations must be in compliance with the Arkansas Department of Health Rules and Regulations. The only exception to this policy is for a student who will enter a 100% online program AND will not visit campus at any time during his\/her program. Without an approved immunization record, the student cannot make library visits, attend sports events, make in-person advising visits, use the HPER facility, attend graduation ceremonies, or participate in any other on-campus events and activities. An applicant must provide an official copy of his\/her immunization record or proper exemption to Student Health. Non-Degree Seeking A non-degree seeking student is accepted into the Graduate School and is allowed to complete up to 9 credit hours without admission to a specific graduate program. The credits may be taken simultaneously or in sequence. This classification is reserved for students who are undecided about their major field of emphasis, who choose to take work for upgrading their professional skills, or who wish to enroll in work for transferring to another graduate school. Any work taken by a non-degree seeking student may subsequently be applied to fulfilling degree requirements if the student applies to and is accepted into a degree program. Note: You will want to check with the department in which your desired course(s) are housed, as some departments limit enrollment to students admitted to their degree program(s).
