(Pass\/Fail courses will transfer if the student can demonstrate that the grade earned would have been a \"C\" or better.) Normally, Lyon College will not accept correspondence course work. Transferred grades will appear on the student's transcript, but will not be figured into the Lyon College GPA. Students academically suspended from another institution must wait at least one semester before being admitted to Lyon. They and students on academic probation at another institution will be admitted to Lyon on academic probation. Students currently enrolled at Lyon College must obtain permission to take academic work at other institutions if they wish to transfer the credit earned to Lyon College. All Core proficiency courses with the exception of courses in foreign languages not offered at Lyon must be verified before credit is awarded. Lyon College reserves the right to determine course equivalence for transfer credit. Transcripts will be evaluated by the Registrar upon admission to the College, and students will be notified of their standing through their advisors. Transfer Student Requirements Transfer students should submit the following: Online application for admission Official transcripts from all colleges\/universities where any work has been attempted College algebra readiness To be considered college algebra ready, students must show they have passed an accredited intermediate algebra class with a C or better, or present an ACT math sub-score of 20 or an SAT math sub-score of 480 (if SAT taken before 2016) or 510 (if SAT taken in or after 2016). Students not college algebra ready are sometimes admitted on the condition that they pass intermediate algebra with a C or better before their first semester at Lyon.
