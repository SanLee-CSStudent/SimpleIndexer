We are excited about our new and restructured basic science program, the Graduate Program in Interdisciplinary Biomedical Sciences (GPIBS), that after completing a common core curriculum, allows students to select among six different tracks that include Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Physiology, Microbiology and Immunology, Neuroscience, Pathobiology, or Pharmacology-Toxicology and Experimental Therapeutics. In addition to GPIBS, we also have graduate programs Pharmaceutical Sciences, Regulatory Sciences, Nursing Science, Clinical Nutrition, and Communication Sciences and Disorders. We have very strong affiliations with the Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing, Health Professions, and Public Health as well as the interdisciplinary institutes that include the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute, Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, Psychiatric Research Institute, Donald W. Reynolds Institute on Aging, Harvey and Bernice Jones Eye Institute, Jackson T. Stephens Spine and Neuroscience Institute, Translational Research Institute, and multiple clinical centers here at UAMS. These collaborations add strength to our graduate programs in the basic and clinical sciences and creates a remarkable network of opportunities for our graduate students. We are proud of the excellent education we provide and the fascinating research we conduct. The UAMS Graduate School is one of the most exciting academic environments in Arkansas and a nexus for some of the most innovative biomedical research in the nation. Please explore the information here and contact us if you have questions. We look forward to hearing from you. Dean Robert E.
