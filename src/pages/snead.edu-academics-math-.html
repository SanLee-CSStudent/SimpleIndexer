The department offers courses leading to an Associate of Science degree through a Mathematics or Engineering pathway. Both of these programs provide the basic preparation leading to science-related careers. The Mathematics pathway also provides basic preparation for those interested in a career of teaching mathematics. We offer a variety of excellent course offerings. We have classes offered in the day, in the evening and online. Associate in Science Pathways for Mathematics Information provided by https:\/\/collegegrad.com\/careers: Aerospace Engineering: Aerospace engineers primarily design aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. Chemical Engineering: Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math to solve problems that involve the use of fuel, drugs, food, and many other products. Civil Engineering: Civil engineers design, build, and supervise infrastructure projects and systems. Electrical Engineering: Electrical engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical equipment. Industrial Engineering: Industrial engineers devise efficient systems that integrate workers, machines, materials, information, and energy to make a product or provide a service. Materials Engineering: Materials engineers develop, process, and test materials used to create a wide range of products. Mathematics Education (Middle\/High School): High school teachers teach academic lessons and various skills that students will need to attend college and to enter the job market. Middle school teachers educate students, typically in sixth through eighth grades. Mathematics\/Mathematicians\/Statisticians: Mathematicians and statisticians analyze data and apply mathematical and statistical techniques to help solve problems. Mechanical Engineering: Mechanical engineers design, develop, build, and test mechanical and thermal sensors and devices.

Bioengineers solve problems in biology and medicine by applying principles of physical sciences and engineering while applying biological principles to create new engineering paradigms, such as biometric materials, DNA computing, and neural networking. Chemical engineers work in the biochemical and petroleum industries, and in areas such as energy, nanotechnology, systems engineering, biotechnology and biomedical engineering, and advanced materials processing, as well as overseeing the chemical process in many industries. Computer Scientists are concerned with the design, modeling, analysis and applications of computer-related systems. They work in areas such as computer system architecture, computer networks, distributed computer systems, programming languages and software systems, information and data management, artificial intelligence, computer science theory, computational systems biology and bioinformatics, and computer vision and graphics. Electrical engineers develop circuits, devices, algorithms, and theories that can be used to sense data, analyze data,extrapilate data, communicate data, and take action in response to the data collected. Industrial engineers focus on the designs, analysis, and optimization of business production systems. Material engineers are concerned with the structure and properties of materials used in modern technology. They build on the foundation of materials science and work to improve the design , fabrication, and optimal selection of engineering materials and create new materials. Mechanical engineers apply principles of mechanics, dynamics and energy transfer to the design, analysis, testing and manufacture of consumer and industrial products. They create machines used in manufacturing, mechanical components of electronics, engines and power-generated equipment, vehicles and their components, artificial components for the human body, and many other products. Math education majors are students who are seeking to become math teachers in grades 7-12. Main Campus P.O.
