In Yuma, AWC TV, channel 74, features a mix of educational programming, student-produced content, live Matador Sports Network broadcasts and more. edTV, channel 75, features live and pre-taped telecourses allowing students to take courses from home by viewing lectures shown at multiple times during the week, then submitting assignments online via Blackboard. In Parker, AWC TV channel 4 features programming selected from both of the Yuma channels, along with informational shows produced in the AWC TV Parker studio. AWC's television channels are a joint project with NAU-Yuma, the City of Yuma, the Yuma Educational Consortium, Time-Warner Cable in Yuma and Sudden link Cable in Parker. Hands-On Learning AWC's TV studio is a state-of-the-art, digital facility which trains students who are seeking a job in television, video production companies, and media-related fields. The program provides practical experience in the use of professional equipment in a digital television studio and editing training using industry-leading hardware and software. Student Productions AWC Television Production and Media Arts students have produced their own live, weekly, half-hour show on AWC TV. For the first seven seasons, it was known as 'AWC Spotlight', and received a Rocky Mountain Emmy Nomination in 2007. In Spring 2010, the producers (aka students) decided to rename it The Dirty Thirty. (Visit the Dirty Thirty Facebook page here for info on the show, and clips from past episodes) In Spring 2011, the name was changed back to \"Spotlight\" again. The students are in charge; the staff of TV Services acts merely as guidance and tech support for their shows. The students plan the shows, host the shows, and serve as the technical crew for the shows, from running camera and audio right up to directing the show. Request a Video Project If your department needs TV Services support for an upcoming event or a video to support your communication strategy, please submit a Marketing Request.
