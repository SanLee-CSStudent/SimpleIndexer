New Business Student Housing Endorsement and Presidential Search Advisory Committee. Dr. Rodney Arnold presented to the board an overview of the student housing project. Dr. Arnold reported the timeline of events beginning in 2016 when the campus housing committee was created by the Foundation board. January 2020, Risley & Associates were hired as the architect company with Butch May as the Construction Manager. The project was placed on pause in April 2020 then resumed in October 2020 with a recommendation to delay to Spring 2021. April 19, 2021 the board received a 16% increase quote from Butch May Contracting, Inc. with the rising cost in materials. Dr. Arnold discussed Anderson Strickler Consultant report, recommending 143 bed facility, a combination of 2 single bedroom suites and 4 single bedroom apartments which lead to the overview of Risley & Associates proposal. Dr. Arnold asked Richard Stipe to report on the residence hall proforma. Mr. Stipe reported the estimated amount of $3.6M for the construction project for a 2 story 64 bed facility, included in the estimate are $600,000 in other costs, 3.15% construction loan, 4.0% estimated 30 permanent loan, $300,000 donations, supervisor salary of $18,000 ($7K benefits plus $10K housing allowance), $550\/month for single bedroom; $460\/month for double bedroom, and a 15% increase which would increase rent rates to $620\/$520. Mr. Stipe commented increase in rent rates would be only placed if the material costs increased by 15%. Mr. Stipe asked the board to consider moving forward with the project and believes if we delay, we could possibly face increase in material costs which would cause the rent rate to increase. Richard stated, \u201Cthere is not anything more strategically important than restoring our enrollment.\u201D He believes this project as been clearly projected and it will have a positive impact on enrollment and not moving forward will only hurt our enrollment. Dr. Arnold predicts there will be third to half of students through summer and the additional income has not included in the Proforma.

Trustee Earnest stated in terms of this proposal are the Board giving their blessing to the Search Advisory Committee and acknowledging the Board are not delegating any decisions or authority to this advisory committee, but the Board will work \u201Chand-in hand\u201D with the committee to collect information about applicants and evaluate the applicants.
