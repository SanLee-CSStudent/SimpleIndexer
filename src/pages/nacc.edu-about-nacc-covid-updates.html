About NACC ? COVID Updates About NACC A- A+ COVID-19 Updates\/Information Hello to everyone! I am happy to report that COVID-19 has declined to the point that masks are no longer required in the classroom, the workplace, or when within six feet of another person. This change in NACC policy is based on recent findings of the CDC, which rate counties by hospital beds being used, hospital admissions, and the total number of new COVID-19 cases in an area. (For more information see https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/your-health\/covid-by-county.html). Based on these ratings, Jackson County has a medium ranking and DeKalb County is rated low. As a result, wearing a mask at Northeast is now OPTIONAL on campus immediately. Stated directly, wearing a mask no longer is mandated in the CLASSROOM, IN WORK AREAS, IN OFFICES, OR IN ANY LOCATION ON CAMPUS. I do emphasis that wearing a mask on campus remains OPTIONAL to anyone. The CDC recommends that in counties ranked low (DeKalb) residents should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines and get tested if they have symptoms (https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/symptoms-testing\/symptoms.html). For those in counties with medium rankings (Jackson), the CDC says if you are at high risk for severe illness, then you should talk to your healthcare provider about whether you should wear a mask, stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, and get tested if you have symptoms. Northeast will monitor CDC data constantly to determine if in the future there is a need to revise this option and go back to wearing masks. Given the surges that COVID-19 goes through, there is always the possibility that masks may again be mandated on campus. Additionally, students, faculty, and staff also are required to follow NACC COVID-19 guidelines, which includes directing positive test results or symptoms to Human Resources Director Lynde Mann (faculty and staff) or to Dean of Student Services Sherie Grace (students \u2013 covidnotifications@nacc.edu). In cases of the diagnosis of COVID-19, if you have symptoms that lead you to think you have COVID-19, or if you have been exposed to someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, you should not return to campus until authorized by the College to do so. A revised, non-mask NACC COVID-19 policy is attached. I do want to commend the Northeast (faculty, staff, students, and administrators) for your outstanding cooperation in helping the College prevent COVID-19 to this point. It has been almost two years since NACC closed on campus and started remote operations for most. The College itself strictly implemented and followed the guidelines that were recommended by the CDC and made every decision on what was thought to be the safest path for everyone. All decisions that have been made have proceeded on the side of caution. Faculty, staff, and students have all been exemplary in following all guidelines put in place by the College. As a result, we have not been a community \u201Chot spot\u201D for COVID-19, despite have an enrollment of some 2,500 students, plus some three hundred and fifty employees, and 1,500-2,000 students per year in our Adult Education program. (There have been local instances of where more than half of relatively large work organizations have contracted COVID-19.) The handling of COVID-19 by all faculty, staff, and students makes me extremely proud of Northeast! There, of course, have been cases among us, but in almost all instances about which we know, the cases were contracted off campus. To this point, I will look back with pride on the way we all have handled the coronavirus pandemic, although as I mentioned this virus is going to be present and with us for a long, long time, and we will continue to monitor it and make decision based on what we think is safest for everyone. As a word of caution, please do remember that COVID-19 and its variants are still out there. Stay diligent, and the College will as well! All the best to everyone!

As part of this effort, UAB will be randomly selecting community college students and employees to participate in COVID-19 testing each week. Only students working on campus or taking a lab or clinical on campus along with all faculty and staff have the opportunity to be tested. To support a safe and healthy environment at Northeast Alabama Community College, we are implementing sentinel testing across our campus. Sentinel testing is a random sampling of all asymptomatic faculty, staff, and students to understand the underlying prevalence of infection at our college so we can respond promptly to any outbreaks or increases in infection rates. You are strongly encouraged but not required to participate in testing, and there will be no penalty for those who choose to opt out. Over the next few weeks, you may receive an email from Healthy@Verily.com asking you to schedule an appointment for COVID-19 sentinel testing. Some of you may have already received this email. If you did not receive it or do not receive one over the semester that is OK. Log into your Verily account to complete pre-test symptom screen and schedule your COVID-19 sentinel test. If you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 12 weeks, please do not retest at this time. If you are having symptoms or have a recent exposure, follow our college health and safety plan, and do not participate in sentinel testing; the health and safety plan can be found within the NACC Faculty and Staff Microsoft Teams files. Check your email for a very important message from Healthy@Verily.com to schedule your COVID-19 sentinel test. If you are selected for testing and your dedicated instructional site is not the location of testing, you may request travel reimbursement. For any questions, please contact Dr. Myrna Williamson (williamsonm@nacc.edu; 256.228.6001, ext. 2299). We thank Governor Kay Ivey, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Chancellor Jimmy Baker of the Alabama Community College System for providing us with this opportunity. Although the testing is not required for relevant students, faculty, and staff, health and science officials say that testing is an excellent way to catch any possible COVID-19 problem at an early stage and to help slow the spread of the virus to others.
