Numerous events, programs, and campaigns are provided annually through the collaboration of faculty, staff, and students. Initiatives include campus-wide media campaigns, awareness weeks, substance-free social events and activities, promotion of healthy behavior across campus, residence hall and classroom presentations, and sponsoring nationally recognized speakers. UCA Statement on Alcohol and Drugs The University is committed to the maintenance of a drug and alcohol-free workplace and the encouragement of a standard of conduct for employees and students that discourage the unlawful possession, use or distribution of controlled substances and alcohol on its property or as a part of any of its activities. Therefore, the unauthorized or unlawful possession, use, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances or alcohol on University property or as a part of any of the university\u2019s activities is expressly prohibited, unless designated otherwise by the President. Off campus activities sponsored by recognized student organizations must abide by all local and state laws. Statement of Disciplinary Action Students violating the university policy on alcohol or drugs are subject to sanctions up to and including expulsion from the university and referral for prosecution. Students who use or possess hard drugs or large quantities of marijuana are typically suspended from the university. Any student allowed to remain in the university will, at a minimum, be required to successfully complete a university sponsored alcohol and drug education course. Employees violating any criminal drug statute while in the workplace will be subject to discipline up to and including termination. Counseling and Treatment Programs The UCA Counseling Center (Student Health Center \u2013 3rd floor, 450-3138) can counsel students or employees who may be using alcohol or drugs as a coping mechanism for stress. They can provide referrals to alcohol and drug rehabilitation and treatment facilities such as Conway Behavioral Health, Phoenix Recovery, Recovery Centers of Arkansas, and Oasis Renewal Center. There are a number of other offices, agencies, and hospitals in central Arkansas that offer treatment and rehabilitation services\/programs. Potential Health Risks Alcohol \u2013 Alcohol consumption causes a number of changes in behavior and physiology. Even low doses significantly impair judgment, coordination, and abstract mental functioning. Statistics show that alcohol use is involved in a majority of violent behaviors on college campuses, including acquaintance rape, vandalism, fights, and incidents of drinking and driving. Continued abuse may lead to dependency, which often causes permanent damage to vital organs and deterioration of a healthy lifestyle. Extremely heavy consumption of alcohol, in a short period of time, may result in alcohol poisoning and death. Cannabis (Marijuana, Hashish) \u2013 The use of marijuana may impair or reduce short-term memory and comprehension, alter the sense of time, and reduce coordination and energy level. Users often have a lowered immune system and an increased risk of lung cancer. The active ingredient in marijuana, THC, is stored in the fatty tissues of the brain and reproductive system for a minimum of 28 to 30 days. Hallucinogens \u2013 Lysergic Acid (LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin cause illusions and hallucinations. The user may experience panic, confusion, suspicion, anxiety, and loss of control. Delayed effects, or flashbacks, can occur even when use has ceased. Phencyclidine (PCP) affects the section of the brain that controls the intellect and keeps instincts in check. Because the drug blocks pain receptors, violent PCP episodes may result in self-inflicted injuries. Cocaine\/Crack \u2013 Cocaine users often have a stuffy, runny nose and may have a perforated nasal septum. The immediate effects of cocaine use include dilated pupils and elevated blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature, followed by depression. Crack, or freebase rock cocaine is extremely addictive and can cause delirium, hallucinations, blurred vision, severe chest pain, muscle spasms, convulsions, and even death. Amphetamines \u2013 Amphetamines can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat, tremors, loss of coordination, collapse, and death. Heavy users are prone to irrational acts. Heroin \u2013 Heroin is an opiate drug that causes the body to have diminished pain reactions. The use of heroin can result in coma or death due to a reduction in heart rate. Applicable Legal Sanctions for Alcohol and Drugs Manufacture or delivery of controlled substance- It is unlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance. Penalties for the manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance can range from three (3) years to life in prison, and fines up to $250,000, depending on the quality and type of drug. In addition, real and personal property used in the manufacture, delivery, or importing of controlled substances may be forfeited to the government. Manufacture or delivery of a counterfeit substance \u2013 It is unlawful for any person to create, deliver, or possess with intent to deliver, a counterfeit substance purporting to be a controlled substance. Penalties for the creating and\/or delivery of a counterfeit substance can range from one (1) to twenty (20) years in prison, and fines up to $15,000 depending on the type of drug being counterfeited. Possession of a controlled or counterfeit substance \u2013 It is unlawful for any person to possess a controlled substance or counterfeit substance.

Underage DUI Law \u2013 The State of Arkansas has an \u201CUnderage DUI Law\u201D (Act 863 of 1993) in which it is an offense for a person under the age of 21 with a blood alcohol content of .02 or greater (approximately one (1) or two (2) beers or hard drinks of liquor) to operate a motorized vehicle.
