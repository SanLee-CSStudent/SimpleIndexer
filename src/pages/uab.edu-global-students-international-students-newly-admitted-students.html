We love seeing new Blazers every semester! Please join our Facebook and Instagram pages. There\u2019s a lot to do before you arrive on campus, so please take a look at the following sections to make sure you\u2019re ready to dive into your new life here in Birmingham! Insurance, Registration, and Housing Immigration Documents, Visa Appointments, and Pre-Arrival Checklists Transfer Students Already in the US Welcome Sessions Insurance, Registration, and Housing You can\u2019t do anything at UAB without first setting up your BlazerID. Make sure you set up your BlazerID first so that you can register for class, access information about student groups, apply for housing, and submit health documents. Health Insurance and Immunizations The United States does not have a universal healthcare system. All international students at every program level (Academic English, Pathway, and degree-seeking) must provide proof of insurance that meets requirements set by UAB Student Health Services. Generally, this means enrolling in the UAB Student Health Insurance Plan. ISSS does not handle insurance and immunization documents and cannot advise on health care plans, costs, coverage, waivers, or renewal. All questions related to these topics must be addressed to UAB Student Health Services after consulting the following websites: Student Health Insurance Medical Clearance and Immunizations Most international students require Level 2 immunizations per UAB policy. Please complete this Immunization Form and upload copies of your relevant medical records and proof of vaccination (translated into English, if necessary) to your Patient Portal following the instructions on the attached form. Please note: tuberculosis testing MUST be performed in the US once you arrive on campus. UAB offers student health insurance through United Healthcare. If you do not wish to purchase UAB\u2019s student insurance, you must submit an insurance waiver through the Patient Portal prior to the deadline determined by Student Health and Wellness. Typically the deadline is two weeks after the semester begins. All questions related to these topics must be addressed to UAB Student Health Services. Registering for Classes Academic English and Pathway students will be registered for classes by their academic advisors and should not be affected by any registration holds. Degree-seeking undergraduate and graduate students must log in to BlazerNET and take active steps to register for classes online before the start of the semester and may face registration holds if immunization, financial, and\/or immigration documents are not provided in a timely manner. Housing If you will begin your time at UAB in an Academic English or Pathway program, you are guaranteed on-campus housing provided by UAB if you confirm and pay your housing deposit before the housing deadline. If you confirm or pay your housing deposit after the deadline, your name will be placed on a waitlist. If you will begin your time at UAB as an undergraduate Pathway student, you must live on campus for your first two semesters. Students may request a waiver if they meet certain criteria. You also must live on-campus in UAB-provided housing for your first (freshman) year in a bachelor\u2019s degree program, but you can apply for a waiver if you meet certain criteria. Read more about Student Housing & Residence Life\u2019s exemption policy by logging in with your BlazerID. If you are considering living off-campus, this guide has tons of helpful information about finding housing near UAB. Once you have created your BlazerID, you can also visit the Off-Campus Housing Service and log in to search for available properties and roommates. You can also post for roommates and set up carpools from the Birmingham airport on our International Blazers Facebook group. Immigration Documents, Visa Appointments, and Pre-Arrival Checklists A note about timing: multiple offices at UAB process applications for our various programs, and applications pass through several databases and platforms before all information is in place so that we can mail a Form I-20 to you. Our goal is to communicate with you about your I-20 within three business days of notification that you have been admitted to UAB. That three-day clock does not start when you receive your \u201Ccongratulations\u201D email from the specific program, since it can take up to three business days for everything to be in place in our systems downstream for I-20 issuance. You can learn more information about obtaining a student visa, and you can see the wait times at various US consular posts. Visa Interview Tips Steps to Obtaining a Student Visa Pay the SEVIS Fee Pre-Arrival Guide (direct entry) Compass Pre-Arrival Guide Checklist for Arrival at UAB Pre-Arrival Guide (AE\/PW) Birmingham Transportation Guide Campus Map Transfer Students Already in the US Students in F-1 status transferring to UAB from another US institution must complete a transfer clearance form and have their Form I-20 released to UAB prior to enrolling in coursework. Students should contact the international student advisor or P\/DSO at their current institution to assist with this I-20 transfer process. Once our office receives your Form I-20 from your previous school and verifies your funding for one year of study, we can issue you a new UAB I-20. Welcome Sessions Depending on your academic program, you must attend one of several international welcome sessions designed to provide you with critical information tailored to your specific program level and make sure everything is in place so that you can start classes. The meeting place for all welcome sessions and the Resource Fair is the lobby of the international center on the second floor of Mervyn H. Sterne Library, located at 917 13th Street South. Please bring your passport, your original paper Form I-20, and a copy of your Form I-94.
