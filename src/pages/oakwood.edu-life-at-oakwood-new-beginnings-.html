Some of the services and initiatives are: Textbook grants Life skills workshops (finances, parenting, etc.) Supplementary child enrichment & care Support groups & Counseling Emergency aid On-site computer lab Food pantry services Free laundry access New Beginnings nurtures and seeks to develop the whole person through a comprehensive program that includes giving back to the community. Our participants regularly engage in outreach and volunteering activities. Giving back to the community that supports our students through volunteerism is an important part in becoming a well-rounded individual and a productive citizen. Our supportive resource aids custodial single parents, male or female, who are enrolled in a college, or other institution of higher learning within the North Alabama area. Based upon the objective to guide them toward independence and success, New Beginnings connects them with available community resources and provides tools to help them to become better parents, students, citizens and children of the kingdom. As a non-profit organization, we depend on the generosity of donors and advocates like you. To apply or learn more please contact Annette Martinez at our office (256) 726-7804 or (256) 726-7801.
