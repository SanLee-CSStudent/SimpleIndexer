Our staff are available for consultation and advice on how to address a concern, and our office may address student conduct issues through the university\u2019s disciplinary process. Disruptive student behavior If a student is disrupting the classroom environment, you have a few options available to you for responding to and addressing the issue. See our guidelines for dealing with disruptive students or the university\u2019s Disruptive Behavior in an Instructional Setting policy for more information. Additionally, you may consult with staff in our office on how to appropriately respond to a disruptive student. Academic dishonesty Academic dishonesty issues in a single class are typically handled by the class instructor and the academic college via the Academic Integrity Policy. However, the Office of the Dean of Students may also assist in responding to an issue, if necessary. Code of conduct violation If you believe a student has violated the Student Code of Conduct, please contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 928-523-5181. You may also fill out our online Public Incident Report Form to report the incident to our office. A Student Life staff member will then follow up with you to gather any additional information as well as the student to discuss the allegations and resolve the matter. Violence prevention resources and support Find more information on how to deal with violence or potential violence on campus.
