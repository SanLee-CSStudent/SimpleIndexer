Monetary fines will be imposed as listed below, depending on whether the offender is an employee or student. Any visitor or contractor found to be violating this policy shall be asked to discontinue the disallowed activity, and any failure by a visitor or contractor to discontinue the disallowed activity after being requested to do so shall result in the visitor or contractor being escorted off the college premises by campus security.

Substance Abuse Prevention Policy It is the College\u2019s policy for all students and College personnel that the possession of, the distribution of, or the use of drugs and alcohol is prohibited. We are committed to providing a drug-free learning and working environment. We have included in our orientation credit course, which is required of all entering students, a section on drug awareness. The College has and shall maintain a drug-free awareness program as an in-service requirement (annually) to inform employees about: A. the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace; B. the College\u2019s policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace; C. any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, or employee assistance program; and D. the penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse violations. WARNING: As set out more fully in Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, for anyone convicted of drug distribution or possession, the court may suspend eligibility for Title IV financial aid. Anyone convicted three or more times for drug distribution may become permanently ineligible to receive Title IV financial aid. Philosophy The College is concerned with both the welfare of the College community and with the academic and personal development of each student. The College strives to create a safe and healthy environment; one in which the high risk of alcohol and other drugs does not interfere with learning, performance and development. Substance abuse disrupts this environment and places at risk the lives and well-being of the members of the College as well as the potential of students for contribution to society. It is important for all members of the College to take responsibility for preventing the illegal or high risk use of alcohol or other drugs from negatively affecting the College\u2019s learning environment and the academic physical and emotional well-being of its students. The College assumes that students are mature adults who have developed mature behavior patterns, positive attitudes, and conduct above reproach. Students must assume responsibility for their own actions. The College recognizes that the use of drug and alcoholic beverages poses potential risk to the health and safety of members of the College and to the community at large. The College policies and procedures regarding standards of conduct and enforcement; legal sanctions regarding unlawful use, possession or distribution; federal, state, and local ordinances; health risks, and where to get assistance are offered here to serve as a guide in Northwest-Shoals\u2019 Drug and Alcohol Prevention Policy. Policy It is the policy of the College that during the month of September of each academic year, information regarding the College\u2019s drug and alcohol abuse prevention policy shall be distributed to each student and employee of the College. Each year, the Coordinator of Student Success shall review its Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program and shall: Determine the effectiveness of its program and report to the President any revisions needed by the program to make it more effective; Ensure that the standards of conduct described in Part II hereof are fairly and consistently enforced; and Submit a written report to the President stating the findings and recommendations of the Team. The President shall implement such of the Team\u2019s recommended revisions as he shall deem appropriate and reasonable. Standards of Conduct and Enforcement The College is a public educational institution of the State of Alabama and, as such, shall not permit on its premises, or at any activity which it sponsors, the possession, use, or distribution of any alcoholic beverage or any illicit drug by any student, employee, or visitor. In the event of the confirmation of such prohibited possession, use, or distribution by a student or employee, the College shall, within the scope of applicable federal and state due process requirements, take such administrative or disciplinary action as is appropriate. For a student, the disciplinary action may include, but shall not be limited to, probation, suspension or expulsion. For an employee, such administrative action may include, but shall not be limited to, reprimand, or suspension, or termination of employment, or requirement that the employee participate in and\/or successfully complete an appropriate rehabilitation program. Any visitor engaging in any act prohibited by this policy shall be called upon to immediately cease such behavior and\/or leave the premises, be trespassed by Campus Safety or arrested. If any employee, student, or visitor shall engage in any behavior prohibited by this policy which is also a violation of federal, state, or local law or ordinance, that employee, student, or visitor shall be subject to referral to law enforcement officials for arrest and prosecution.

Alabama Community College System (ACCS) Formal Complaint Process The Alabama Community College System (ACCS) Board of Trustees and Chancellor provide oversight of the State\u2019s public two-year community and technical colleges, Marion Military Institute (MMI) and the Alabama Technology Network (ATN). While most complaints should be handled at the local college level, or with the applicable entity, the ACCS System Office, through the Legal Division, also renders assistance to resolve complaints after all local avenues of resolution have been fully exhausted. If the local avenue of resolution included appeal rights to the ACCS Chancellor, then the Chancellor\u2019s decision is deemed final and a complainant may not file a complaint using this process. Each college, MMI and the ATN are charged with providing effective and efficient avenues for employees, community members, and other interested parties to address complaints. The ACCS Formal Complaint Process is not intended to supersede or replace existing processes in place at the local college level. Complainants seeking to file a report of noncompliance of federal or state law, or system policy should first address the problem by utilizing the local complaint process prior to initiating the ACCS Formal Complaint Process. Complaints of allegation of fraud, malfeasance, presidential misconduct, or other case specific instances, where the local grievance process may not result in an unbiased evaluation, may be filed using the ACCS Formal Complaint Form and will not be required to follow the local complaint process stated above. Complainants may submit a formal complaint using this process if there is dissatisfaction with the results at the local level, or the complaint deals with allegations of fraud, malfeasance, presidential misconduct, or other case specific instances that necessitate a direct filing through this process. Formal complaints must be submitted on the required ACCS Formal Complaint Form. Complaints may be mailed to: Alabama Community College System Legal Division-Confidential Formal Complaint Post Office Box 302130 Montgomery, AL 36130-2130 The Legal Division will only review completed, signed and dated complaint forms. The Legal Division will issue a written response within a reasonable time usually between 30-45 business days. The identity of the complainant will be kept confidential and will be withheld from any information submitted to the ACCS entity identified in the complaint.
