About The Program Application deadline is May 1 Medical laboratory technicians are critical to correctly diagnosing a patient. Every sample is different, and so are the results. Medical laboratory technicians can help solve mysteries by analyzing results. Approximately 70% of a physician\u2019s medical decisions of any one patient are influenced by laboratory testing data. With continued growth in the medical profession, there is an increasing demand for highly skilled, well educated, and highly motivated professionals. Approximately 5,000 lab personnel are graduating each year, but there are 12,000 needed annually. Northark also offers an online Associate of Applied Science in Medical Laboratory Technology.

Faculty Contact Sherry Gibbany MLT Program Director (870) 391-3288 sgibbany@northark.edu \"I realized that the MLT program is very important in the medical field because we are the people that are behind the scenes. We work with physicians and help diagnose what is wrong with the patient. We can provide accurate results to the physician so they can diagnose a patient and come up with the best course of treatment. I plan to be an MLT in the future. I may further my education and get a bachelor\u2019s degree later.\" - Eveline Marquez, MLT student Learning Outcomes Graduates of the MLT program will be able to demonstrate entry level proficiency and competency in collecting and processing specimens, performing analytical tests, recognize factors that affect procedures and results, monitor quality control and relate lab findings to common disease processes in the following areas: Blood banking (immunohematology) \u2013 measured by program subscore on the ASCP registry exam Urinalysis \u2013 measured by program subscore on the ASCP registry exam Chemistry - measured by program subscore on the ASCP registry exam Hematology - measured by program subscore on the ASCP registry exam Immunology - measured by program subscore on the ASCP registry exam Microbiology - measured by program subscore on the ASCP registry exam MLT Program graduates will be able to demonstrate entry level competencies in laboratory operations by conducting preventive and corrective maintenance of equipment, demonstrating professional conduct and communication skills, interacting with other healthcare professionals, and demonstrating proficiency in laboratory math skills. Laboratory operations \u2013 measured by program subscore on the ASCP registry exam. Licensure and Certification Students graduating from Northark\u2019s MLT program meet the requirements to take the American Society of Clinical Pathology (ASCP) certification exam. Upon the successful completion of the ASCP exam, the student becomes Nationally certified. This is a National certification and not a state license. State licensure is required in several states but proof of diploma for completion of an MLT program and proof of National certification are all that the graduate needs to present. We are unsure of other specific licensure qualifications that some states may require. There are a few states (California, Florida and possibly New York) that specify more stringent requirements and it would be up to the student to look up the requirements for those states.
