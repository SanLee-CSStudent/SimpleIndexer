Who is the Honors College? How do I Apply? Sharing Stories: The Diversity, Ecology, and History of the Mobile=Tensaw Delta Thanks to the support of a grant from the Alabama Humanities Foundation, The Honors College at The University of South Alabama has collected oral histories from current and former residents of the greater Mobile-Tensaw Delta, particularly Blakeley Bluff in Spanish Fort. These narratives will be shared through a public conversation with the community by way of this online conference. Our hope is not only to share stories and imbue curiosity, but also to create what philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah calls an \u201Cendless shared conversation of friendship\u201D that cultivates a foundation for social and cultural understanding across our varied heritages, cultures, and experiences. Watch Zoom Session Virtual Workshop on Social Movements During this unprecedented time in history, when racial issues are drawing a response from those who might otherwise be silent, we are seeing many people taking action, often for the first time. When there is social unrest, it is important for the community to be equipped with knowledge and resources. As part of its inclusive mission and commitment to leadership and community, the Honors College invites all community members--students, faculty, and staff--to participate in a Workshop on Social Movements. The purpose of this workshop series is to provide historical and contemporary context of social movements responding to anti-Blackness, and an education about the Movement for Black Lives. This workshop is co-sponsored by the Honors College, the Office of Community Engagement, the McCall Library, the Department of History, and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Learn More about Workshop The University of South Alabama Honors College is a diverse community of interdisciplinary excellence designed to stimulate the thinking and intellectual curiosity of highly motivated students. Here in Honors we challenge each other through discussion, research, creative scholarship, intercultural engagement and the arts so that together we create the feel of a small college environment in the midst of the opportunities provided by a large urban university. Our graduates, equipped with this intensive education as well as a wide variety of additional learning experiences, are especially well-prepared for productive careers, committed citizenship and meaningful lives. Some Unique Honors Programs Summer Internships with the Delta Fellows Program The Honors College in collaboration with the USA Office of Community Engagement organizes organizes annual community engagement internships through grants received from the Jean O\u2019Connor Snyder Internship Program (JOIP) sponsored by the David Mathews Center for Civic Life.The Center is a non-profit, non-partisan corporation which builds skills, habits, and capacities for more effective civic engagement and innovative decision making throughout all 67 Alabama counties. Delta Fellows Interns collaborate with local communities to build long-term university-community relationships built on immersive civic engagement principles. The goal is to support the needs of the citizens of the Mobile Bay region. During Summer, 2020, four Delta Fellows aim to collaborate with the communities surrounding Blakeley and the Mobile-Tensaw Five Rivers Delta. The Oxford Consortium for Human Rights The Honors College at the University of South Alabama is a member of the Oxford Consortium for Human Rights (OCHR). The Consortium hosts teaching and research seminars on human rights, global conflict, humanitarian aid, peacebuilding, and related subjects. Their aim is to understand and develop constructive solutions to the problems of today, drawing from scholars and students from a wide variety of disciplines. Four Honors College students attended the Oxford Consortium Workshop in Oxford, UK in July 2019. Five students attended the OCHR Workshop Series: Community, Identity, and Human Rights in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in October 2019. Students were slated to attend in-person events in 2020, and will continue to attend when in person opportunities resume. In the meantime, South Alabama is active in online workshops such as the OCHR\u2019s first ever Webinar, \u201CPandemics, Epidemics & Human Rights,\u201D and its subsequent offering, \u201CInequality, Racial Justice & the COVID Crisis.\u201D The World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates The World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates regularly brings Nobel Peace Laureates together to foster their legacy of peace, and to continue to keep peace in the forefront of global attention. The Honors College has joined as a partner in its work, and participated in the most recent Summit. This gathering was held in Merida, Mexico in September 2019, focused on both the Mexican legacy and the nation\u2019s involvement in the global peacebuilding process. The program engaged civil society and youth from throughout the world by providing them the tools and strategies needed to achieve peace at local and global levels. Six Honors College students attended and returned with a wealth of knowledge that they were eager to share. Story available here.
