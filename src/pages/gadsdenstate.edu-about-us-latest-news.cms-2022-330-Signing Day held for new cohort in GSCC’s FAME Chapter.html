All News & Updates 05\/23\/22 Signing Day held for new cohort in GSCC\u2019s FAME Chapter Anniston, Ala. \u2014 The fourth cohort for Gadsden State Community College\u2019s FAME Chapter signed with their respective companies during a signing ceremony May 19 at the Cheaha Center on the Ayers Campus. FAME, or the Federation of Advanced Manufacturing Education, is an apprenticeship-style program that allows students to attend class on the Ayers Campus two days a week and work three days a week in a local advanced manufacturing facility. \u201CFAME students have the unique opportunity to work and get experience while receiving instruction,\u201D said Alan Smith, dean of Workforce Development at Gadsden State. \u201CToday, you are signing your golden ticket. If you do everything asked of you by the College and by your employer, you will graduate and immediately start a career making as much as $60,000.\u201D Smith said 119 people applied for the new cohort of students with only 28 being selected for employment at one of eight industry partners. \u201CYou\u2019re starting off strong,\u201D he said during the signing ceremony. \u201CStay the course and you\u2019ll have a tremendous amount of earning potential. The rewards when you finish this program are amazing.\u201D Smith said the Gadsden State FAME Chapter is considered one of the best in the state in large part due to the partnership with East AlabamaWorks, an organization that provides solutions for closing the skills gaps and maximizing workforce efforts to ensure alignment of resources. The partnership was formed from the beginning of the program in 2018. \u201CWorking with industry in Region 2, we heard the challenges they had when it came to filling the pipeline with skilled employees,\u201D said Lisa Morales, director of East AlabamaWorks. \u201CThey especially needed industrial automation technicians, so we worked to come up with a solution to fill that need. We knew it could only be done with a strong college partner and we knew we needed Gadsden State to be that partner.\u201D After five semesters of classroom education and on-the-job training, graduates of the FAME program will receive an Associate in Applied Science in Industrial Automation, a FAME advanced manufacturing technician credential and five Lean Manufacturing credentials. \u201COne of the best rewards for completing the FAME program is the two years of verified experience you will earn,\u201D Andy Robertson, Gadsden State\u2019s workforce coordinator, said during the signing ceremony. \u201CIt\u2019s huge to make money while you\u2019re in school but it\u2019s even better that you get two years of experience.\u201D To be considered for the FAME program, students must apply and be accepted to Gadsden State, complete a FAME application and write an essay. Qualified applicants then go through an interview process with a panel comprised of 12-15 industry partners. Program participants are then selected by the industry partners in a draft-style process. \u201CI hope you all know what an honor it is to be accepted into this program,\u201D said Tarina Vannetta, FAME instructor. \u201CYou are entering a program that truly is a global-best support system.\u201D The following students have been selected to participate in the FAME program and work for one of eight world-class industry partners: Bridgewater Interiors Aragonn Gauge Mitchell from Randolph County High School Hunter Lee Johnson from Lincoln High School Eastman Chemical Jackson Roberts from Cleburne County High School GH Metal Solutions Austin Mulligan from Fyffe High School Honda of Alabama Tyshawn Kerley, a graduate of Central High School of Clay County Jose Arroyo from Munford High School Noah Monday from Hokes Bluff High School Trey Lovvorn, a graduate of Gadsden City High School Brennan Butler from Cleburne County High School Koch Foods Evan Owens from Glencoe High School Justin Lindsey, a graduate of Sand Rock High School Briteon Husk from Oxford High School Alexander Cole, a graduate of Sardis High School Matthew Alexander Galbreath from Glencoe High School Kronospan Caden Mitchell from Ranburne High School Mason Lockridge from Hokes Bluff High School Madison Wiley from Oxford High School Nathan Carr from Oxford High School Kade Alexander Keith, a graduate of Munford High School Lucas Grant Harcrow from Cleburne County High School Gavin Mosely from Oxford High School Kaleb Harman from Ranburne High School M & H Valve Michael Carney from Munford High School Ryan Devon Miller, a graduate of Oxford High School Prince Metal Stamping Mackinzy Bonds from Oxford High School William Roblero from Anniston High School Tanner Holderfield from Southside High School Gerardo Rios-Reyes, a student at Oxford High School, was named an alternate.
