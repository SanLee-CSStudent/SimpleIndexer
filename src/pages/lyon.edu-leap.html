The area offers the best qualities of the Natural State including hiking, biking, paddling, camping, caving, rock climbing, fishing, and hunting. To help students take advantage of our location, Lyon College developed the Lyon Education and Adventure Program (LEAP), which provides its students with information and access to the many activities available in this gateway to the Ozarks. On-Campus Activities The Campus is equipped with a bouldering wall, disc golf course, two hiking and biking trails totaling approximately 5 miles, and a ropes course including both high and low elements. Off-Campus Trips All outdoor trips are based on the \"Common Adventurer\" philosophy which holds that the foremost goal of any common adventure is to achieve an enjoyable and worthwhile experience while displaying the greatest respect for the natural environment. The common adventurer, due to the varying degrees of ability of each participant, can best achieve this goal by becoming part of a \"common\" group effort. In the spirit of this effort all decisions are consensus group decisions. In addition to outdoor trips in the Batesville area, LEAP offers trips over extended holidays to a variety of national and international locations; this allows participants to be involved in an even wider variety of activities. How Do I Get Involved? LEAP is a program that is educational for beginners, as well as for experienced individuals. The LEAP office is located at the corner of College and 23rd street.
