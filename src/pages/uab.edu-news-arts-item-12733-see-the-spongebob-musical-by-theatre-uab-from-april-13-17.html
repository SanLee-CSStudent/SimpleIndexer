Theatre UAB will present \u201CThe SpongeBob Musical,\u201D adapted from the iconic television series, from April 13-17 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201CThe SpongeBob Musical\u201D tells the story of SpongeBob, Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks and all the citizens of Bikini Bottom as they face imminent disaster. When the volcano of Mount Humungous threatens to annihilate the town, the friends must come together to face what may be their final moments \u2014 when a most unexpected hero rises to take center stage. Theatre UAB is the performance company of the College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 Department of Theatre. Shows are nightly at 7:30 p.m. April 13-16, with a matinee performance at 2 p.m. April 17, in the Alys Stephens Performing Arts Center\u2019s Sirote Theatre. Tickets are $15 and $20, for students $6, and for UAB employees and senior citizens $10. Call 205-975-2787 or visit AlysStephens.org. With a score by writers including Yolanda Adams, Steven Tyler, Sara Bareilles, John Legend and more, and a book by Kyle Jarrow, the play is based on the series by Stephen Hillenburg, with musical production conceived by Tina Landau. Theatre UAB chose this show not only because it was crafted by an incredible and diverse group of writers, but also \u201Cbecause in these challenging times, we wanted to offer our student performers and our audiences a chance to laugh while being transported to a zany and creative world,\u201D said director Valerie Accetta. \u201CWhat has surprised all of us in this process is how much heart there is in the show and how it inspires us to come together instead of splinter apart,\u201D Accetta said. There are themes of government inaction, distrust in science and racism; but there are also singing sardines, a dish sponge on a mission and a tap-dancing squid. As they tell this story of community, Accetta says, Theatre UAB wants to be mindful of our own imminent disaster: climate change. \u201CIn that spirit, our designers have partnered with UAB Recycling and Sustainability to use recycled objects in some of the scenic elements, have repurposed pieces from previous shows for our props design, and have been inspired by Vivienne Westwood and her passion for sustainability in the costume design,\u201D Accetta said.

The performance company has also partnered with Freshwater Land Trust, who discussed their mission of preserving the lands and waters of central Alabama on a guided hike before they started rehearsals for the show. These discussions \u201Ccontinue to inspire us throughout the process as we grow in our community and work together to tell this story,\u201D Accetta said. Student director Devin Franklin of Hueytown, Alabama, says the show\u2019s timeliness is eerie: A community exploited, mislead and misinformed struggles to find belonging and meaning while facing a world-ending crisis. \u201CIt should not take impending doom for us to be compassionate and supportive of one another,\u201D Franklin said. \u201CThese old systems don\u2019t work anymore. SpongeBob\u2019s outlook encourages us to use our imaginations to build a new and more caring world.\u201D About the cast and crew Choreography is by Jemison guest artist\/scholar Tuan Malinowski of Buffalo, New York, with guest artist B.B.
