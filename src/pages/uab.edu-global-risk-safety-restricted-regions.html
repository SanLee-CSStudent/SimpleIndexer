Travel can be approved when there is compelling justification and no suitable alternative opportunities exist. All requests must be strongly linked to academic goals and must adequately address major health, safety, or security concerns. The UAB International Travel Risk Management Committee will not support travel that takes place without adhering to the requirements of the Protocol for Heightened Review of International Travel to Restricted Locations.
