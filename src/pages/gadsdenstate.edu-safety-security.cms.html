The campus parking, traffic, and safety regulations in effect at Gadsden State College, as well as all applicable state laws and city ordinances, will be enforced by the Campus Security at all times. These regulations, laws, and ordinances apply to ALL persons while they are on a Gadsden State Community College campus. If a vehicle is properly registered with the College, a student may park in any designated parking place except those having a blue, yellow, or white curbing. Parking spaces with white curbs are reserved for faculty and other staff members only. Parking spaces with blue curbs are for handicapped parking with a permit and yellow curbs are no parking at any time. Motor Vehicle Registration All students, faculty and staff, using a motor vehicle on any Gadsden State Community College campus must register it with the Safety and Security Office. The student vehicle registration fee is included in the tuition fee. The driver will be issued a hangtag, which is to be hung from the inside rearview mirror of the vehicle. It is the driver\u2019s responsibility to keep this hangtag available for use in the vehicle that is driven on campus. However, the hangtag may be moved from one vehicle to another vehicle if necessary. If a hangtag is lost or stolen, the driver must purchase a new one for a fee of $10. Types of Hangtags Two types of hangtags are issued by Safety and Security on all campuses: (1) a Faculty \/Staff hangtag and (2) a Student hangtag. If the driver is disabled or if the driver is driving for a disabled person, the vehicle may be parked in a space reserved for the disabled (blue curb) so long as the vehicle bears both the student hangtag and a placard for the disabled. This placard may be obtained through the Office of the Revenue Commissioner. All student hangtags expire on August 31 of year indicated on the hangtag. General Regulations When issued a hangtag, the owner of the hangtag will be held responsible for any violation in which the vehicle bearing this hangtag is involved. In the event of mechanical failure of a vehicle, the owner should inform the Information Desk of the vehicle\u2019s location; the owner will be responsible for its removal as soon as available services will permit. The Office of Safety and Security may cancel the registration of any vehicle.
