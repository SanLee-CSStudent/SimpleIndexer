During her lengthy career, Mrs. Marion Horne Beasley returned to TROY many times to pursue her love for learning, enhance her teaching, and acquire educational certifications, eventually earning three degrees. Although she was primarily an elementary teacher, she also taught high schools classes ranging from English to biology, and she was proficient in all of them. A former student said of her, \u201CShe was smart as a cricket .\u201D She remained devoted to learning and teaching, and for that, she was beloved by her family, students, colleagues, and community. This scholarship fund honors her and expresses appreciation to Troy University for providing her with the opportunity to pursue her love for learning over a period of 40 years. Quite appropriately, the scholarships provided by this fund will reward mature women who pursue teaching degrees or certification. Preference will be given to rural educators and residents of Barbour County. Ms. Jane Beasley is a 1974 graduate of Troy State University. She taught at Eufaula High School before attending law school at the University of Kentucky, graduating (J.D. degree) with honors, including the Law Review and Order of the Coif.
