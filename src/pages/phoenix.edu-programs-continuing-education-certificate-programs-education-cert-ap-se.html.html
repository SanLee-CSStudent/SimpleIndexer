Educator\/Principal licensure requirements vary by state. Candidates located in a state that does not provide a direct path to licensure will be required to obtain Arizona certification first, prior to seeking licensure in their home state as an out-of-state prepared teacher\/principal candidate. Arizona certification requires candidates to pass all Arizona-specific licensure requirements, including any Arizona-specific exams (or home state equivalents if recognized by Arizona Department of Education.) After obtaining an Arizona teacher\/principal certificate, candidates can then apply for licensure in their home state and may be required to complete additional testing and\/or requirements at additional cost. Program requirements may change based upon your home state\u2019s agency licensure requirements. Please visit the teacher licensure page https:\/\/www.phoenix.edu\/state-licensure-requirements\/teacher-education.html or the principal licensure page https:\/\/www.phoenix.edu\/state-licensure-requirements\/principal.html for state specific requirements prior to reaching out to your state agency. *While widely available, not all programs are available to residents of all states.
