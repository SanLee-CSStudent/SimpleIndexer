LBW is rooted in a tradition of excellence in Performing and Visual Arts. As LBW President, Dr. Brock Kelley mentions in his video, young students in our entire service area are introduced to Fine Arts by LBW's Traveling Theater and The Ensemble, which have performed for over 300,000 children for over 45 years. Many of our Fine Arts students go on to become the most talented contributors to our communities. Help us engage and inspire our future artists by contributing to our Fine Arts campaign. Your gift of $25 today will further develop our innovative programming in arts education and invest in the future of the next generation of talented artists.

Wallace Community College is a public, two-year institution in the Alabama Community College System under the governance of the ACCS Board of Trustees. Donations can be made directly to the College either in monetary form or equipment and supplies. The Lurleen B. Wallace Community College (LBWCC) Foundation is a private, non-profit organization incorporated under a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. The foundation was established to seek and secure resources beyond state and local revenues for the purpose of supporting educational scholarships, programs, and other needs of the college. Gifts to the foundation support and build educational opportunities for individuals in the communities it serves. Memorials, Honorariums, and Annual Gifts Each year the foundation receives donations given in memory or honor of individuals. The foundation recognizes these gifts by sending a note to the family of the person being remembered or honored. The standard method of making a contribution, mailing or delivering a check or money order, is not the only form of payment accepted. Other accepted mechanisms are: Bequest: One of the most common and simplest forms of planned giving is a bequest. A bequest is a gift of property that is made through a donor's will. The bequest is free of estate tax. Gift Annuities: Gift annuities allow a person to make a tax-deductible gift and receive a fixed income for life for you and\/or others you choose. They can be created with gifts of relatively modest amounts. Endowments: An endowed scholarship allows an individual\/business to establish a scholarship that will last in perpetuity. The corpus of the endowment is secure and only the interest is used to make the scholarship award. Endowed scholarships assist students in the service area of LBWCC.
