Her position at UAB places her in charge of preventing infections among patients and staff at one of the largest public hospitals in the country. Infection prevention, broadly defined, is any \u201Caction that a person can take to prevent a pathogen from entering the body and causing disease,\u201D Duncan said. The good news is that these actions are \u201Csomething that anyone can learn,\u201D she added. One of the major lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic is that everyone needs to learn about basic infection prevention measures before it is a matter of life or death, Duncan says. When the pandemic began, \u201CI saw how confused my family and friends were and how quickly they lost faith in the people that they thought they could trust: the government, the CDC, the World Health Organization and even their doctors,\u201D Duncan said. \u201CWhen people are in the middle of a crisis, they are not really open to learning new things. They fall back on what they know or what they think they know, and it is very difficult to try to trust a new person when you are just trying to survive.\u201D This article is based on a presentation that Duncan delivered as part of a series organized by UAB\u2019s Alabama Regional Center for Infection Prevention and Control Training and Technical Assistance, or ARC IPC. Watch Duncan\u2019s presentation in full here, and learn more about ARC IPC at sites.uab.edu\/arcipc. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not likely to be the last serious outbreak we encounter. Of the deadliest disease outbreaks stretching back a century, more than half have occurred in the past two decades alone, Duncan explains. And increasing development worldwide and interactions between humans and animals mean that it is a matter of when, not if, we all have to deal with another disease epidemic, she said: \u201CWe have to do a better job of empowering people on how to protect themselves from new pathogens.\u201D Understanding the chain of transmission The best place to start, Duncan says, is with a model known as the chain of transmission. 1) Infections start, naturally enough, with an infectious agent. \u201CThe most important part of the whole chain of transmission is a pathogen\u2019s being able to enter a susceptible host,\u201D Duncan said. \u201CThis means that the pathogen is able to live and multiply in the new host.\u201D For some infectious agents, this can mean colonization, \u201Cwhere the pathogen lives in the tissues but isn\u2019t causing disease,\u201D Duncan said. But as we all know, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is very good at infecting humans. 2) The infectious agent normally lives, grows and multiplies in a reservoir. This might be the environment, an insect or on a surface. Or, as with COVID-19, \u201Cthe reservoir is mainly humans, although we know it can also live in animals,\u201D Duncan said. Infection prevention, broadly defined, is any \u201Caction that a person can take to prevent a pathogen from entering the body and causing disease,\u201D Duncan said. The good news is that these actions are \u201Csomething that anyone can learn,\u201D she added. 3) To infect someone new, infections need a portal of exit from their reservoir. For COVID-19 that is the respiratory tract. 4) COVID-19\u2019s mode of transmission is illustrated when a person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. \u201CThe mode of transmission is mainly through direct contact with those droplets, or to some extent some aerosolized particles,\u201D Duncan said. \u201CResearch has found that the ability to be transmitted through surfaces is a little less common with COVID-19.\u201D 5) Infecting another person requires a portal of entry, which for COVID-19 is \u201Cthe eyes, nose and mouth of the new host,\u201D Duncan said. 6) Even once the infectious agent makes it inside another person, that person must be a susceptible host. Again, unfortunately, \u201Cthe susceptible host with COVID-19 is really any person of any age, although older adults and those with preexisting medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill,\u201D Duncan said. Breaking the chain To prevent the transmission of a pathogen, infection prevention experts follow a tried-and-true playbook. 1) Stop it at the source Eliminate the infectious agent or source. \u201CThis can be done by giving an antimicrobial to a patient who has an active infection or treating a wound infection so that no bacteria can go out into the environment,\u201D Duncan said. Quarantine exposed individuals during the incubation period. That way, \u201Cif the person is to develop an infection, there is no place for them to spread it to,\u201D Duncan said. Isolate symptomatic persons. \u201CSo there is no new host that the infectious agent can infect,\u201D she said. Eliminate the reservoir. Use an approved disinfectant to clean surfaces or the pieces of equipment that the pathogen may be living on. Testing and surveillance. This is especially important \u201Cto identify where the reservoirs are if a disease has asymptomatic spreaders, like COVID-19,\u201D Duncan said. 2) Interrupt the portal of exit \u201CIf we haven\u2019t been able to kill the reservoir, then we need to move to the next link in the chain and interrupt the portal of exit,\u201D Duncan said. Respiratory hygiene\/cough etiquette. \u201CMake sure that, if somebody is coughing or sneezing, they are doing it into their elbow or a tissue,\u201D Duncan said. Masks prevent droplets from being dispersed into the environment, \u201Cand we found with COVID-19 that masking the source person is very effective in reducing transmission,\u201D she said. Clean and cover. Keeping wounds clean and covered is another important method of stopping the spread of infections that are passed on in body fluids or feces. 3) Interrupt the mode of transmission \u201CIf we haven\u2019t been successful yet, then we need to interrupt the mode of transmission,\u201D Duncan said. Standard precautions. Hand hygiene, use of gloves, safe injection practices, sterilizing instruments and cleaning environmental surfaces \u201Care an essential practice to prevent the spread of disease,\u201D Duncan said. Transmission-based precautions. These are used for highly infectious agents such as flu and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. \u201CAnybody who enters the room is required to wear a mask to prevent the droplets from the patient hitting mouths or noses, and then if they are close enough, within 3 to 6 feet, they wear eye protection as well,\u201D Duncan said. Adequate ventilation. Over the past several years, \u201Cwe have learned how important it is to ensure that pathogens are not spread by the air \u2014 they are being removed by effective filters or there is enough fresh air coming in to dilute the virus,\u201D Duncan said. 4) Protect the portal of entry \u201CIf the pathogen does find a mode of transmission, there are several things we can do to block entry into our bodies,\u201D Duncan said. Masks and eye protection protect the most common access routes. Clean and cover. \u201CIf we have breaks in our skin, we can make sure they are clean and covered with a bandage,\u201D Duncan said. Remove extraneous equipment. In a health care setting, \u201Cwe can remove any catheters, IVs, drains or tubes when possible so we don\u2019t give pathogens a direct route into our bodies,\u201D Duncan said. 5) Increase the host\u2019s defenses \u201CAnd then if all the efforts to break the chain fail and the pathogen makes it into the new host, then there are several things we can do to stop the pathogen from causing an infection,\u201D Duncan said. Vaccines. \u201CThe number one way to protect people from a potential pathogen is through the administration of an effective vaccine,\u201D she said. \u201CVaccines have essentially eliminated childhood illnesses that killed or maimed so many children in the past. I\u2019m really one of the first generations who doesn\u2019t know anybody who has had measles, mumps or polio. And my children\u2019s generation is one of the first ones that won\u2019t know anybody who has had chickenpox.\u201D Antibiotics. The discovery of antibiotics has revolutionized the fight against pathogens, Duncan said, \u201Cbut we have learned pretty quickly that we need to be careful with antibiotics, because the pathogens are smart and they can learn how to evade them, so antibiotic stewardship is hugely important.\u201D Good health habits. \u201CAn individual\u2019s health is so important in protecting them from pathogens,\u201D Duncan said. \u201CStudies have shown that people who smoke or have uncontrolled diabetes or are obese have worse outcomes if they are infected with COVID-19.\u201D Personal hygiene. \u201CRemoving pathogens from our hands and skin with soap is so important, and then making sure that we have good oral hygiene as well,\u201D Duncan said. \u201CBoth of these will prevent reservoirs on our body for the pathogens to live.\u201D Published in Be Healthy back to top Be Healthy An infection prevention expert explains how to avoid COVID, flu \u2014 and the next pandemic UAB Health System\u2019s senior director of Infection Prevention breaks down the chain of transmission and how we all can lower our risk of getting sick. posted 21 days ago 1205 views Be Healthy My Health Rewards offers incentives for making healthy choices This past year, more than 4,500 employees activated their My Health Rewards account, and more than 3,400 logged enough healthy behaviors to receive a payout of $50 or more. posted a while back 1187 views Be Healthy Achieve mental clarity through mindfulness meditation this spring Join University Recreation\u2019s spring mindfulness series Jan. 25-April 14 to begin practicing mindfulness strategies to reduce stress and improve mental health. posted a while back 1577 views Be Healthy Questions about the $400 vaccine incentive payments?
