Chair Bill Lovell called the meeting to order at 3:03 p.m. Trustees Kevin Cheri, R.G. Earnest, David Evans, Scott Miller, Sarah Newman, and Don Tomlinson were present. North Arkansas College personnel attending included Dr. Rick Massengale, Scott Howie, Nell Bonds, Don Sugg, Joe Berry, Mandy Kilbourn, and Dr. Randy Esters. Approval of Agenda Chair Lovell asked if there were any changes to the agenda. There being none, the agenda stood approved. Regular Reports Finance Report\u2014Don Sugg presented the preliminary FY2018-2019 finances. He stressed the importance of remembering that these results are tentative; a change of $300,000 to $400,000 is not unusual due to pending June transactions. The E&G budget shows all revenue above 100% of budget, while all expenses currently show coming in below budget for the year. Currently, this account shows a net gain of $458,000. This is partly due to benefits being a lower percentage of salaries than previously (32.9%) and state revenue being $8,000 higher than initially expected. The Auxiliary is currently showing as down $72,000, putting the year-end balance at $3,796. Expenses are all coming in below budget, but so are revenues. This account will most likely show less change than E&G because there are fewer transactions pending. Differences in budgeted versus actual College Store expenses and revenues play a large role in this account; book sales resulted in 50% of the planned net gain for the year (although food and drink sales were higher than expected). Athletic revenues were down 14% from budgeted, due in large part to the high school tournament revenue being less. Athletic expenses were under budget. Mr. Sugg presented some future considerations, saying that we will explore any and all possibilities. He stressed that the Auxiliary account has to be addressed moving forward or it will become an issue for the College. He also pointed out that the College Store has assembled a quality team and that the net gain change is not a sign of mismanagement but simply a sign of the changing times. Trustee Miller added that we should continue to adapt to the changes and strive to keep efficiency high in order to meet the changing needs of our students. President\u2019s Report\u2014Dr. Randy Esters shared that he was surprised and moved by the turn out for the tree dedication because it shows that people matter at North Arkansas College. He pointed out that enrollment for the fall semester is down 116 right now, but he pointed out that it is still early and that some new requirements could be having an effect right now. The LPN-RN Bridge program has been renamed the RN Bridge and will now enroll paramedics. This is needed in our community, as previously paramedics had to drive to Mountain Home to be able to join a program to become an RN. He also shared that we are in talks with SEARK and NARMC to establish a Respiratory Therapy program that would be a partnership between all three institutions. This program would be a big asset to the community, especially since Mountain Home has closed their program. Joe Berry and Dr. Massengale are working closely with others in the community to offer options to those affected by the closing of Flexsteel. Joe Berry shared that the good news is that there are many jobs available for the 109 employees, but we will be reaching out to let them know that school is an option. The College Grill will become the new home to Knuckle Sandwich, owned and operated by Chris and Heather Hinrichs. Dr. Esters shared that is his hope that people from the community will come in for lunch. He encouraged everyone to support the new grill, which plans to open the first day of classes and operate from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Welding Instructor Steve Stanley was one of 25 in the nation to participate in the inaugural Lincoln NC3 Training in Cleveland, OH. Scott Howie shared that NC3 is a national certification group that will give our students and instructors access to a large selection of national certifications. He will learn more about all NC3 has to offer when he attends training later this summer. Northark is a Leadership School for NC3. North Arkansas College\u2019s PBL recently competed at nationals, placing 1st or 2nd in the nation in four different events. Dr. Esters shared that we are proud of the students and their accomplishments, adding that he was personally proud of his son for a 2nd in Parliamentary Procedure and 1st in Network Design. The Northark Foundation has partnered with area business leaders to once again present the Summer Movie Series, which will kick off on Saturday, July 27th with Detective Pikachu. This year will be a little different, wrapping up with a Battle of the Bands in October. Everyone is encouraged to attend and to help present these opportunities to the community. Consent Agenda The Consent Agenda included the June Regular Meeting Minutes, June Special meeting Minutes, Replacement Position\u2014Truck Driving Faculty, and Water Line Easement on North Campus. Chair Lovell asked for a motion to approve the Consent Agenda as presented. A motion was made by Trustee Earnest, seconded by Trustee Miller, and unanimously approved. New Business No new business. Board Comments Chair Lovell reminded everyone that the August Regular Board Meeting will take us into the fall semester, then asked the Trustees for any questions or comments. There being none, Trustee Tomlinson made a motion to adjourn. The motion was seconded by Trustees Earnest and Evans and passed unanimously; the meeting adjourned at 3:45 p.m. Locations & Directions 870.743.3000 Webmaster Contact Vendor Information Employment Opportunities ACT 852 Economic Security Report Facility Reservations ?
