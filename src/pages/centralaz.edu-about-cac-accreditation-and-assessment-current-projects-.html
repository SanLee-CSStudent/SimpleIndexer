Only 50 percent of students enrolled in developmental English or reading courses and 28 percent of students completing developmental math successfully complete their first college-level class. Action Project \u2013 Quality Matters The goal of this Action Project is to increase student satisfaction with online and hybrid courses by implementing an organized approach in educating faculty and relevant staff about quality online and hybrid course development and delivery, based on establishing and reviewing best practices which will lead to total transparency, consistency, and consensus among those who teach online and hybrid classes. This will be accomplished by using Quality matters, a sophisticated, faculty-centered course review and improvement system for online and hybrid institutional instruction. Action Project \u2013 Strengthening the Use and Awareness of Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) Through Employee-Initiated Mini Projects This Action Project will contribute to developing practices and an institutional culture that supports continuous improvement. In subsidiary, by strategically applying a continuous improvement method, the project is likely to result in measurable improvements in services and programs that support student learning. Specifically, the proposed Action Project would give faculty, staff, and administrators an opportunity to learn and apply Plan Do Study Act, a key continuous improvement practice, and its associated tools through participating in 15 PDSA mini-projects of their choice that support institutional and operational goals.
