Based on research, including UAB employee input, we are implementing a pilot program on September 1 to further explore long-term alternate work options (hybrid\/remote) for qualified positions. This benefit aligns with UAB\u2019s shared values and is a strategic business decision to retain and attract top talent. Limited Eligibility to Participate in the Alternate Work Option Pilot During the initial phases of the pilot, we will test strategies and measure results among a limited group of Workgroup A staff who meet criteria and are approved to participate. Phase I of the pilot is limited to participating central administrative units only; Phase II allowed schools and colleges to join the pilot. Many jobs require an in-person presence to best serve our students, patients, community and each other, so many roles will not be eligible for remote or hybrid schedules. Some jobs, however, can be done well \u2014 and sometimes more effectively \u2014 off-site. Access the UAB Employee Workforce App online to determine whether your job title\/role can be considered for an alternate work schedule during the pilot. If your job is considered eligible, you will see \u201CRemote\/Hybrid-Possible: Yes, if supported by operational plan\u201D clearly identified below your workgroup assignment and above your specific job title. If a group or individual\u2019s job title\/role can be considered for a remote\/hybrid work schedule, an administrative unit has the discretion \u2014 based on local needs including the ability to manage and monitor productivity among groups or individuals \u2014 to include or not include those positions\/individuals in proposed operational plans. UPDATE \u2014 Alternate Work Options Pilot Extended to July 31, 2022: Phase I began Sept. 1, 2021; Phase II began Jan. 1, 2022. Due to staggered start times of the pilot, continued COVID surges and The World Games\u2019 likely impacts to campus operations in July, the pilot has been extended until July 31, 2022. What we learn will guide decisions on the future of remote\/hybrid work structures as we strive to remain a competitive employer of choice and maintain excellence in every area of our mission. Process Resources Alternate Work Options Process Participating units\/schools will submit an operational plan that outlines and justifies proposed remote or hybrid work schedules among eligible Workgroup A staff; operations plans must be approved before implementation. A proposed alternate work schedule should benefit the institution and must be made based on the job\/business need, not an individual\u2019s personal need or desire. Supervisors are encouraged to use discretion to determine what staffing structure in their unit is best for the institution. Org Admin will update the individual employee work options in the dashboard based on instruction from the supervisor in collaboration with unit leaders. The dashboard data will update to the Alternate Work Option Proposal Form. It is here that additional information will be provided to support the proposed plan. Once this form is completed it will be submitted for review and approval by the President\/SVP. After the plan is approved, the managers and staff participating in the pilot will be assigned required training that must be completed before beginning the alternate work option.
