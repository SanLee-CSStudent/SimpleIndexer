Its mission is to help and serve wherever there is a need in the community through collaboration and work of people who, inspired by the love of Christ and his example, wish to serve others. Smiles for Christ meets twice every month during the school year. Meetings are hosted in the Mabee building on Thursdays where we discuss different activities planned for upcoming weeks. Our main activities are Pupusa Sales, which are planned to happen twice a semester, and Latin Fest, which happens during the spring semester and invites the non-latino community to the McInteer Rotunda to celebrate Latino heritage and features delicious traditional snacks from the different countries represented. There are several ways in which the Harding community can get involved with Smiles for Christ. One of the easiest ways is to support and attend our events throughout the semester or to purchase different items (handmade purses, earrings, shoes) that we also sell. We also invite anyone to attend the meetings to learn more about our mission and support the Latin Fest.
