Download Printable Poster Safety Guidelines for anyone on a Troy University Campus or location: Effective: Monday, Oct. 18, 2021 Masks\/Face Coverings are optional inside Troy University buildings or facilities but are encouraged in any setting where social distance is difficult to maintain. Masks\/Face Coverings remain mandatory on University Transit vehicles. In addition, faculty members may, at their discretion, REQUIRE masks\/face coverings in the instructional settings to include: \u2022 Classrooms \u2022 Labs \u2022 Personal meetings between students and faculty Faculty may also retain a mask\/face covering optional policy for their instructional spaces. Faculty expectations regarding masks\/face coverings must be communicated to students in the class and updated in the online syllabus. Vaccinations are strongly encouraged. All students, faculty and staff are urged to get a COVID-19 vaccination, either on the Troy Campus or through a health care provider of your choice. Classrooms, offices and other facilities will operate at normal capacity. In addition to masks\/face coverings, individuals are asked to be mindful of personal distance and observe social distance whenever possible indoors. Maintain proactive personal health practices including washing hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces; refraining from touching your face; sneezing or coughing into a tissue or the inside of your elbow; and disinfecting frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible. Stay home when sick. Stay home if you are not feeling well, particularly if you are exhibiting any symptoms of COVID-19 including fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. (Students: See reporting procedures below for receiving an excused absence due to COVID-19 related absences.) Procedures for Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 or Exposure: If you are DIAGNOSED with COVID-19 Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (regardless of vaccination status) must isolate for at least 5 days. Following that, individuals may return to campus if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving (without fever for 24 hours) and should wear a mask when around others for the next 5 days. Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 must notify the University using the COVID Contact Tracing Worksheet (Positive) in order to receive an excused absence. Employee absences related to a diagnosis of COVID-19 should be reported to human resources by supervisors. Individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 should notify their close contacts who may have been exposed. A person is considered to have been exposed if he or she has been within six feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes in the 48 hours prior to that person developing symptoms or testing positive (see CDC standard for \u201Cclose contact\u201D). If you have been EXPOSED to COVID-19 A person is considered to have been directly exposed if he or she has been within six feet of a person with a COVID-19 diagnosis for at least 15 minutes in the 48 hours prior to that person developing symptoms or testing positive (see CDC standard for \u201Cclose contact\u201D). Students, faculty or staff who are unvaccinated or more than 6 months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than 2 months after the J&J vaccine) and are not yet boosted, should quarantine for 5 days. Following that, individuals may return to campus if they have not developed symptoms, but should wear a mask when around others for the next 5 days. People who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure. Students who need to quarantine due to exposure must notify the University by completing the COVID Contact Tracing Worksheet (Exposure) providing details about how they were exposed. There will be no excuse for the absences issued until this form has been completed. Employee absences related to COVID-19 exposure should be reported to human resources by supervisors. Quarantine\/Isolation Procedures Where should I quarantine\/isolate? If you need to quarantine or isolate due to exposure or a diagnosis of COVID-19, you must do so off campus or at your legal residence. What if I am unable to quarantine\/isolate at home or off-campus? The University maintains limited quarantine\/isolation space on campus for students who cannot travel home or to an off-campus residence. Contact Student Services at covid19@troy.edu or (334) 670-3202 for assistance. Can I quarantine\/isolate in my dorm if I live alone? You may quarantine in your dorm room only if you have a single-occupancy room\u2014 i.e., you do not share a bathroom or living space with any other student. If you choose to quarantine\/isolate in your dorm, you must notify Student Services at covid19@troy.edu or (334) 670-3202 to receive meal delivery. Assistance and Expectations for Students As Troy University continues to navigate COVID pandemic, the following are reminders of assistance and expectations for Troy University students: As members of the Trojan Family, students are expected to treat the COVID virus seriously, to adhere to the University\u2019s current COVID-related policies and protocols and to take all precautions to keep themselves, and their fellow Trojans, safe. Specific class questions (making up missed work while in quarantine) should be directed to the course instructor. Students may also contact the Department Chair for the course(s) in question. If a student is unsure about the Department Chair contact information, the student can receive that information by emailing the course number and title to jwscss@troy.edu. Students are expected to participate in all virtual class meetings while quarantined if these classes are made available via virtual delivery. Students are expected to maintain regular contact with their course instructors while quarantined and are responsible for working with their instructors to make up all missed work during the quarantine period. Faculty will record, and report, students who are quarantined and not participating in virtual class meetings as these are provided. Not participating in these virtual meetings will be considered an absence. Students who are quarantined for positive COVID test results who become ill need to contact their instructors about any issues related to virtual participation. Students who are quarantined for COVID exposure are expected to participate in all virtual class meetings as these classes are made available.

This move was made to protect the health and safety of the campus community in response to rising COVID-19 case numbers. In the weeks since, we have been pleased to see a steady decline in the number of cases being reported both on our campuses and in the surrounding communities. In Alabama, new cases have fallen by 61% in the last 14 days, and in Pike County new cases are down by 68% (per The New York Times). On the Troy Campus, we have been thrilled to see multiple days with no new cases reported among our students, faculty and staff. In addition, the number of individuals vaccinated at the University continues to grow. On the Troy Campus, 90% of faculty survey respondents have indicated they are vaccinated. In light of these falling case numbers, and after careful consideration, the University will begin gradually easing the mask requirement. Effective Monday, Oct. 18, masks\/face coverings will be optional inside campus buildings and facilities. However, faculty members may, at their discretion, require masks\/face coverings inside instructional spaces (i.e. classrooms, labs, etc.) to include faculty offices. In addition, masks\/face coverings will still be required on University Transit vehicles. Students must follow the mask guidelines established by their professors for classes, labs and office visits. Hallways, common areas and other indoor spaces will be mask\/face covering optional. Students are still urged to be proactive about their personal health, and masks\/face coverings are recommended in settings where social distancing is difficult to maintain, particularly for individuals with underlying health conditions or who have elected to remain unvaccinated. Other aspects of the safety plan remain unchanged. Stay home if you are sick, and report if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or must isolate due to exposure. The revised safety guidelines can be found online at troy.edu\/coronavirus. The Coronavirus Task Force continues to meet regularly to discuss this ongoing situation.
