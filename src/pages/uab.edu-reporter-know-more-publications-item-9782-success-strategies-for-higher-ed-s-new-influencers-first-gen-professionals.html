She then shares stories and strategies for mastering the hidden curricula of the workplace, from navigating office politics to coping with imposter syndrome and making career-building professional connections.Just before she left for her first professional conference, Mary Blanchard Wallace proudly showed her mother the new blue jeans she purchased for the occasion. \u201CI had only worked in the hardware store\u201D that her father and mother owned in the small Louisiana town of Brusly, recalled Wallace, who went on to earn a doctorate in workforce education and is now assistant vice president of Student Experience at UAB. \u201CI only knew jeans and, if you wanted to dress up, nice jeans.\u201D As Wallace writes in her new book, \u201CFirst-generation Professionals in Higher Education: Strategies for the World of Work\u201D ($34.95, Center for First-Generation Student Success \u2014 purchase from publisher here), her mother\u2019s reaction was decisive. \u201CYou cannot wear jeans, Mary,\u201D she said. \u201CThis is not a hardware conference.\u201D Her mother proceeded to sew a new pair of slacks and gave Wallace her own silk blouse to wear. \u201CLooking back on that moment, I now understand that I was still developing and understanding the hidden curriculum of my new work: the dress code,\u201D Wallace writes. Although she was embarrassed that \u201CI did not understand the mores of my new profession,\u201D Wallace said, \u201Cmy mom knew what I did not know, and she saved me from the greater embarrassment of how I would have pictured myself if I had worn those jeans to the conference.\u201D First-gen students make great first-gen professionals in higher education, Wallace argues. \u201CIn my experience, we fight for the underdog, because we have been there,\u201D she said. \u201CWe understand that there are root causes behind these situations and know what it is like to have your feet in many different worlds. It was because someone invested in me as a student that I made it.\u201D But success in professional work can require different skills than the ones needed to graduate. As Wallace found out, there is a hidden curriculum with an array of courses, from networking to navigating office politics. \"A story for every student\" The UAB freshman class of fall 2021 was the largest and most diverse in university history, with more than 45 percent representing minority populations and 28 percent first-generation students. \u201CThere is a story for every student,\u201D said Wallace, who is assistant vice president of Student Experience at UAB. \u201CMy job is to listen to them and affirm them and find resources so they can be successful \u2014 not just graduate or be retained, but so they can fulfill their dreams and the dreams of their families.\u201D In \u201CFirst-generation Professionals in Higher Education,\u201D Wallace and 14 other chapter co-authors share their stories and strategies for mastering these skills when you do not have lived experiences to fall back on. How do you find a mentor? How can you prepare yourself financially, so you are free to move in search of the right job fit? How do you make the kind of small talk in a conference buffet line that can spark new friendships in your field? The book, which is the first of its kind, answers these questions in ways that are both research-driven and eminently practical. (See LOL Tours and Six-Degree Maps.) Book buzz builds in person and online Wallace\u2019s latest conference trip was memorable for an entirely different reason than her first. At the annual meeting of NASPA, the national association of student affairs administrators in higher education, in March 2022, \u201CFirst-generation Professionals in Higher Education\u201D was the bestselling book, and Wallace\u2019s book-signing generated the longest line. \u201CWatching the reception of this book has been a professional highlight for me,\u201D she said. Her book has generated online buzz as well. Each of the 10 chapters includes a series of reflection questions. Every Friday, Wallace and La\u2019Tonya Rease Miles, Ph.D., a chapter author and founder of the Empowering First-Generation College Students Facebook group, have been posting one of those reflection questions to the group. \u201CThe post from last Friday has over 150 responses,\u201D Wallace said in mid-April. \u201CThrough the posts, we have found three or four more authors and given people the voice to share their stories.\u201D Story continues below box LOL Tours and Six-Degree maps The advice and strategies shared in Wallace\u2019s book follow the directive \u201Cspeak simply,\u201D she said. Describing how to navigate workplace bureaucracy and politics, Willie Banks, Ph.D., vice chancellor for Student Affairs at University of California Irvine, suggests an LOL Tour \u2014 listening, observing and learning to get the lay of the land. In their chapter on the importance of professional networks and resources, Samantha Payton, Ph.D., director of Research, Assessment and Planning at the University of Mississippi, and Brandi Hephner LaBanc, Ph.D., vice chancellor for Student Affairs and Campus Life at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, begin by explaining the why of networking. \u201CFirst-generation professionals tend to rely heavily on self,\u201D they write. \u201CThough this character trait is a strength \u2026 in terms of resilience, problem solving and intrinsic motivation, it can create a challenge when it comes to networking and self-advocacy.\u201D Why put yourself through the stress? \u201CSuccessful networking is about forming authentic connections between yourself and others and being directed to tap into resources that will support your goals.\u201D Payton and Hephner LaBanc then proceed to practical ways to build out those connections \u2014 including creating a Six Degrees of Separation map (a nod to the pop culture-famous Kevin Bacon game) to find new links in the chain needed to expand a professional network. \u201CIt\u2019s time for a book like this\u201D The idea for the book originated in a conversation at another conference, where Wallace was talking with Sarah Whitley, Ph.D., assistant vice president with NASPA\u2019s Center for First-generation Student Success. \u201CI said there are things about being a new assistant vice president that feel like when I was a first-gen college student,\u201D Wallace recalled. \u201CIt feels new to me, even though I have been in the field 25 years. It really goes back to how first-gen professionals navigate.\u201D Contrary to the prevailing deficit-based language around first-gen students, groups such as the Center for First-generation Student Success have begun to emphasize these students\u2019 assets and how they can be leveraged for success. Wallace wanted to extend the idea to first-gen professionals as they moved into mid-level and higher positions. Whitley said, \u201CI think you are onto something.\u201D Wallace came back to UAB and talked with her boss, John R. Jones III, Ph.D., vice president for Student Affairs, who suggested she write a book on the topic. \u201CI replied, \u2018Are you kidding? All that is out there are a few dissertations,\u2019\u201D Wallace said. \u201CAnd he said, \u2018That\u2019s the perfect reason to write a book.\u2019 So I took the idea to some trusted colleagues in the field to workshop it and they told me, \u2018Mary, we have to do this. It\u2019s time for a book like this.\u2019\u201D Story continues below box Making the mid-level transition Just as first-gen students do, first-gen professionals in higher education need support, Wallace says. This is especially true as they reach mid-level positions, usually at director level, with eight to 10 years of experience. \u201CThat is usually when you get your first big budget, staff and experience with politics,\u201D she said. Other challenges include \u201Cdeveloping networks to prepare for job transitions, finding sponsors and senior-level mentors, and defining next career steps,\u201D Wallace writes in her opening chapter. \u201CThis book is a resource for mid-level first-generation professionals, to increase understanding of the topics presented and to encourage them to reflect on their own journey in higher education. As such, each chapter ends with activities, exercises and\/or reflection questions.\u201D Contributing to change Still, Wallace said she is not naturally a risk-taker, and the idea of writing a book \u201Cwas like climbing the Grand Canyon for me.\u201D So she is glad that \u201CDr. Jones pushed me out there.\u201D UAB\u2019s culture of innovation inspired her to take on the project as well, Wallace says. \u201CThere is such a vibe here to change the world and to use your skills and abilities to do that. I have always been encouraged to find my niche and contribute to knowledge-building.\u201D To her surprise, Wallace found herself enjoying the process. \u201CI expected as a first-time editor that I would be tearing my hair out,\u201D she said. \u201CBut this has been such an affirming project. It was a labor of love and a sheer joy to write and edit, and we had a great group \u2014 the authors came together and treated it like a learning community, building on our combined knowledge.\u201D The center suggested she connect with LT Miles, who was an executive director of First Year Experience and Strategic Initiatives at UCLA and then dean of Student Affairs at Menlo College before joining the startup Career Launch as partner and director of Scale and Support. (Miles and Danette Buie, Ed.D., wrote a chapter on resilience.) Other authors, including Brian Hemphill, Ph.D., the first African American president at Old Dominion University and co-author of a chapter on pathways to senior leadership, came through connections in Jones\u2019 network. (Jones wrote the book\u2019s chapter on understanding personal finances.) Wallace also tapped other members of her network, including her personal mentor Doris Ching, Ph.D., emeritus vice president for Student Affairs for the University of Hawai\u2019i System. \u201CWe had great diversity in this book, including racial diversity, LGBTQ authors, staff, senior-level administrators and faculty,\u201D Wallace said. Wallace has already identified several gaps that she would like to fill in a second book \u2014 including the role of familial expectations \u2014 and is outlining areas for further research. \u201CThere is more work to do and more support to put in place for first-generation professionals,\u201D she said.
