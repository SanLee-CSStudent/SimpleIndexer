She worked her way through college in the 1930\u2019s without financial help. She taught before she was married, privately tutored homebound children, tutored in the literacy program and guided her daughters, Carol, Nada, and Miriam, toward higher education. Carlotta mentored others by providing encouragement and opportunities. She loved to travel and considered seeing the United States and other countries as an educational journey. Besides family, friends and teaching, her love was music. She helped bring music and dance enrichment to Casa Grande with the first community concert series. For many years Carlotta was a member of the Central Arizona College Foundation Board of Directors and served as Secretary. The Carlotta S. Gilbert Memorial Scholarship endowment fund was established in 2019 by Carol Gilbert Cox, Nada Jagerson and Miriam Patrick, daughters of Carlotta and Guy Gilbert. The scholarship provides tuition and\/or book awards for students enrolled in the education program.
