(Photography: Andrea Mabry)The American College of Emergency Physicians has named UAB Hospital-Highlands Emergency Department a Level 1 Geriatric Emergency Department, making the University of Alabama at Birmingham home to the only accredited geriatric ED in Alabama, the first one in the Southeast and just the 17th Level 1 ED in the world. \u201CWe are so honored to be able to provide this service to our geriatric patients,\u201D said Dag Shapshak, M.D., co-director of the Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine Program. \u201CFor a long time, we have had all these different pieces of the puzzle, but this was the final piece in becoming the region\u2019s first wholly integrated age-friendly health care system. Now we are able to streamline geriatric care from inpatient to outpatient to help reduce lengths of stay and avoid unnecessary hospital admissions.\u201D This is the highest level of accreditation a hospital can receive from the American College of Emergency Physicians and recognizes UAB Medicine\u2019s commitment to providing a high-functioning emergency department for older adults where everything from the processes to the facilities are tailored specifically to meet their needs. The geriatric ED is part of a specialized pathway for older adults to allow them to feel more comfortable during their visit. In the ED, patients will be placed in separate enclosed rooms with curtains, sound-absorbing materials and other accommodations to reduce noise. The geriatric ED is also equipped with LED lighting with bi-level dimming, non-slip flooring, handrails, and color-contrasting walls, floors and doors. Patients will also find safe mobility equipment, comfortable furniture, analog clocks on the walls, and wall-to-wall art of local scenery to remind them of the current time and location. The facility also offers a variety of resources such as delirium prevention toolkits to help reduce instances of confusion. Upon arrival to the ED, older adults will undergo an Identification of Seniors at Risk assessment. The ISAR results assist in identifying patients who may need a more comprehensive assessment in the ED. Based on a patient\u2019s score, a geriatric emergency nursing intervention expert, or GENIE nurse, may come in and complete additional screenings to identify any needs that must be met before the patient can be safely discharged. The GENIE nurse will share the screening results with the medical team to determine an appropriate treatment plan. The geriatric ED is equipped with LED lighting with bi-level dimming, non-slip flooring, wall-to-wall art, and color-contrasting walls, floors and doors.

GENIE nurses also conduct follow-up calls to ensure the patient is getting the treatment they need. By organizing these outpatient services, patients can avoid unnecessary hospital admissions and experience a continuity of care from the time they enter the geriatric ED to the time they are sent home. \u201CWe always want to ensure our older adults are getting the best care possible for their situation, even when they are back at home,\u201D said Emily Simmons, MSN, R.N., CNL, program development manager and NICHE coordinator. \u201CThe geriatric ED bridges the gap between our Acute Care for Elders Unit and the emergency department and allows us to quickly identify a patient\u2019s needs and get them connected with the right resources in our system.\u201D The ACE Unit is a model of inpatient geriatric care that utilizes an interdisciplinary team of nurses and physicians trained in geriatrics to proactively manage geriatric syndromes, such as cognitive impairment, risk of falls, risk of confusion and functional decline, while a hospitalist physician manages each patient\u2019s acute medical diagnosis. The Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation prioritizes geriatric-focused education and multidisciplinary staffing, smooth transitions of care from the ED to other settings (inpatient, home, community-based care, rehabilitation, long-term care), standardized approaches to care that address common geriatric issues, and geriatric-focused quality improvement and enhancements of the hospital environment. This accreditation was a three-year effort led by UAB\u2019s Department of Emergency Medicine in collaboration with the Division of Gerontology, Geriatrics and Palliative Care, Rehabilitation Medicine and Therapy Services, pharmacy services, social work services, and nursing. \u201CThis was truly a collaborative effort that involved multiple disciplines across UAB,\u201D said Frank Sortino, UAB Hospital-Highlands administrator. \u201CWhen the pandemic began, it would have been easy to put this on pause; but everyone was really committed to making this happen to continue providing the highest quality of care for our geriatric patients.\u201D To learn more about ACEP\u2019s Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation, click here. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
