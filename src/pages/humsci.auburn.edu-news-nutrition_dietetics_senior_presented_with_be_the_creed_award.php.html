Be the Creed Honoree and Nominees at the 2022 Involvement Awards. Since authoring the Auburn Creed in 1943, Dr. George Petrie\u2019s words representing character, integrity and spirit have resonated with Auburn students, including College of Human Sciences senior Maria Buitrago Diaz, the 2022 recipient of the \u201CBe the Creed\u201D award. Diaz, who is majoring in Nutrition Dietetics and will be attending Tufts University in the Fall for her master's degree and a dietetic internship, was chosen out of several nominees who exhibit outstanding values and character. Diaz admitted that early on as a freshman she wasn\u2019t sure if Auburn was the right place for her after enduring struggles, but over time she grew to love it. \u201CI\u2019ve met plenty of amazing students who live their life representing the values of the Creed, so it was a huge honor and surprise to have been chosen for this award,\u201D Diaz said. \u201CI started out this year with a vision to increase exposure to my field and create opportunities for students in my department to gain practical experience and get involved with the community. I think my classmates deserve way more credit for caring so much, having awesome ideas and actively taking steps to enhance our department. It has been a team effort.\u201D Since 2015, Auburn University Student Conduct developed the Be the Creed campaign as a way to promote positive decision making, honesty and respect among all Auburn University students. The campaign engages students, staff and faculty in recognizing the behaviors, attitudes and actions of others that exemplify the Auburn Creed. In addition, Student Conduct accepts nominations throughout the year from staff, faculty and students for the Be the Creed award and for 2022, Assistant Professor and Director of Graduate Clinical Education Programs Dr. Donna Burnett nominated Diaz for two standout values she exemplifies. Burnett attributed Diaz\u2019s hard work and helpfulness as reasons for her success as a student and involvement with student organizations. \u201CMaria is an extremely hard-working individual with an unusual maturity towards her work as an undergraduate student,\u201D Burnett said. \u201CIn addition to her high level of academic success in my classroom, she also works on behalf of her undergraduate program as the president of the Student Dietetic Association where she organizes service activities to allow the group members to work on and off-campus to serve the community.\u201D One example of Diaz\u2019s work ethic is leading the officers of the Student Dietetic Association and helping them thrive under her leadership. They are working hard to help patients who do not have sufficient resources to purchase continuous insulin pumps by planning and promoting a fundraising walk for diabetes to raise $10,000 for East Alabama Health. Diaz also credits Burnett as being a positive influence for helping her succeed during her time at Auburn. \u201CDr. Burnett is the advisor for the Student Dietetic Association and has been my professor of several years,\u201D Diaz said. \u201CWe both entered this year not really knowing what to expect for the organization. It was her first year as our advisor and I honestly had no idea how to run a student organization, so we figured it out as we went. She is supportive of her students and is open to new ideas. She is always available to help us when we need it and has been an incredible mentor with a heart of gold.\u201D For more information on the \u201CBe the Creed\u201D campaign, visit conduct.auburn.edu\/bethecreed\/..
