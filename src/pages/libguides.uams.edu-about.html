THE HISTORICAL RESEARCH CENTER The Historical Research Center acquires, preserves, and provides access to rare and archival materials that document the history of medicine, and is the state\u2019s premier repository for medical history. The Center is the repository for over 7,000 rare History of Medicine books and significant archival collections of health professionals and organizations, including Joycelyn Elders,MD, who served as the United States Surgeon General during President Bill Clinton\u2019s tenure; as well as the papers of Edith Irby Jones, MD, the first African-American admitted not only to UAMS but to any public, Southern medical school, and the records of the Arkansas Nurses Association. The Center provides assistance to researchers in its fifth floor reading room and provides presentations, as well as digital and physical exhibits on the history of the health sciences in Arkansas. One exciting project in-progress is Women of Color in Arkansas Medicine, which seeks to document the contributions to the health sciences by women of color, who, historically, have been under-documented and understudied. The digital product will show the significant impacts of diverse health professionals with Arkansas connections. The Center works closely with the UAMS Society for the History of Medicine and Health Professions, which supports the mission of the Historical Research Center through programming, acquisitions, and guidance. The Center and Society sponsor the monthly Stay-at-Home lectures on historical medical and health sciences Arkansas subjects.
