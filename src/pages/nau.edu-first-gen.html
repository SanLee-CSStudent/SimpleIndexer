First\u2010Generation Students Almost 46% of NAU students on the Flagstaff campus identify as first-generation, meaning neither of their parents or guardians earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. First\u2010generation students are trailblazers, forging new paths for themselves and their families. At Northern Arizona University we are striving to become a campus of excellence for first\u2010generation students.
