Additional Benefits Tuition Reimbursement A full-time employee who participates in course work from a regionally accredited institution may receive reimbursement for up to twelve (12) credit hours within a fiscal year (6 credit hours per semester). Applications should be submitted no later than two (2) months before the activity begins. Failure to apply within the stated time frame may mean that available funds have already been disbursed. This program has limited funds and is first come, first serve. Funds may be used to reimburse up to 70% of tuition expense for course work to a maximum of the current average credit hour cost at the three state universities. Upon successful completion of approved course work with a grade of C or better (if on a grading system), the employee will submit documentation along with proof of payment to the Office of Talent Development. If the college or university is on any other grading scale, the employee must provide proof of successfully completing the course. Employee Tuition Grant Full-time employees and their dependents are eligible for an Employee Tuition Grant for classes taken at Central Arizona College. The grant applies only to general tuition, registration and processing fees. The grant does not apply to out-of-state tuition, special course fees, non-credit course fees, and other fees that may be associated with the course. Eligible dependents are also entitled provided they are living with and dependent upon the employee for principal financial support. This includes lawful spouse, unmarried children or stepchildren under age 24, or a person who is under the legal guardianship of the employee. Adjunct faculty and part-time employees may enroll for up to six (6) credit hours during the semester they teach a course. Dependents of adjunct faculty and part-time employees are not eligible for the tuition grant benefit. Adjunct faculty and part-time employees who qualify for, but do not use their eligibility, may not bank the eligibility for use in a later semester. Eligibility for each semester is contingent upon continuing to meet the criteria as stipulated. Students under work-study assignments are ineligible for tuition waivers. Computer Literacy Incentive Program (CLIP) This program allows you to select and purchase a computer for up to $2,500 through the College. The employee will make payments through payroll deductions for up to 24 months interest free. The purpose of this program is to encourage employees to keep up with technology.
