Explore our history Welcome to Harding University Harding began as a senior college in 1924, when two junior colleges, Arkansas Christian College and Harper College, merged their facilities and assets, adopted the new name of Harding College, and located on the campus of Arkansas Christian in Morrilton, Ark. In 1934 Harding was moved to its present site in Searcy, Ark. The board of trustees approved the study's recommended change of Harding to university status, and on Aug. 27, 1979, the name of the institution officially became Harding University. We are, at our core, a Christian university. The character, example, and concerns of Jesus Christ are the standards that shape us and chart the course for our future. Because of this, an all-encompassing love for God and a corresponding love for people are at the heart of who we are. Harding's mission is to provide a quality education that will lead to an understanding and philosophy of life consistent with Christian ideals. Explore this section to learn more about our mission, our history and what makes us stand apart as a Christian university. The President Robert C. Walker, chairman of Harding\u2019s board of trustees, announced the selection of Dr. Michael D. Williams as the sixth president of Harding University on Oct. 27, 2021. This announcement represents the conclusion of a nine-month, nationwide search during which input was received from all Harding constituencies. Williams assumed the presidency of Harding on June 1, 2022, receiving the baton of leadership from Dr. David B. Burks. For 30 years, it has been a formal activity at the University, and new strategic plans have been developed every five years. While assessing, reviewing, listening, dreaming, defining, implementing, measuring and adjusting never cease, every five years we focus on strategic planning in a more concentrated way as we chart the course for Harding\u2019s future. Learn more by reading the five-year 2018-2023 Strategic Plan, the Year One Report (2019) and Year Three Report (2022).
