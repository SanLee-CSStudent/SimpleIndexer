He didn\u2019t know anyone from New York and didn\u2019t recognize the name of the man who signed the letter, Jim Carlina. That was because when Curtis and Jim first crossed paths in 1968 in a landing zone in Vietnam near the Cambodian border known as \u201CLZ Dot,\u201D Jim had been just one of the many men that Curtis, as a Pathfinder, had assisted. Curtis\u2019s job was to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the helicopter pilots so that the pilots could focus on maneuvering.

Jeff Hawes, English Instructor at Northeast Alabama Community College, commented, \u201CIt was once said to me, a former Southern gospel singer, that one can\u2019t possibly be from Sand Mountain and not be a singer. In fact, Russ Deerman, Dutton native and former member of the Regents Quartet, recalls Hovie Lister, singer for the Statesmen and one of the most revered gospel singers of all time, saying, \u2018Every good quartet must have an Alabama singer.\u2019 In fact, when I traveled from 2010-2015 with Grammy Award nominee and Gospel Music Association Dove Award winner, Karen Peck and New River, countless musicians from Nashville, Atlanta, and beyond knew exactly where I was born and raised when I would timidly reply, \u2018Sand Mountain.\u2019 I soon realized I had nothing of which to be ashamed for my musical background but instead everything of which to be thankful. Some of the greatest, most cherished and awarded voices in Southern gospel music have come from or have roots on Sand Mountain.\u201D FALL SEMESTER 2019 EARLY REGISTRATION GOING ON NOW AT NORTHEAST July 30, 2019 Fall semester at Northeast Alabama Community College is fast approaching.
