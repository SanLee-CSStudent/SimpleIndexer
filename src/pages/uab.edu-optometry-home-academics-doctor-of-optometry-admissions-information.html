Online and AP\/CLEP Courses We will accept prerequisite courses taken online or credits via AP\/CLEP courses provided they are offered by an accredited college or university. Documentation of AP\/CLEP courses should appear on the undergraduate transcript or through official score reports. Optometry Admissions Test (OAT) Applicants are encouraged to take the Optometry Admissions Test, which is offered online. We suggest taking the exam during the spring\/early summer of the year preceding anticipated application. If the results of the exam are considered to be unsatisfactory, you then have the opportunity to repeat the exam during the summer\/early fall of the application year. The exam can be retaken 90 days after the first test date. Other professional school entrance exams may be considered on a case-by-case basis. For more information and to register online for the OAT, visit the Optometry Admissions Test website. It is not necessary to take the OAT before applying. Interview invitations are extended to competitive applicants without OAT scores. However, admissions decisions cannot be made without OAT scores.

Letters of Recommendation or Composite Evaluation If available at the applicant's undergraduate institution, a composite evaluation by a pre-health professions advisory committee is preferred. If you are unable to get an HPA composite letter, the three individual letters should come from two faculty members who are knowledgeable about your scholastic abilities and personal character and one optometrist with whom you have shadowed and\/or worked. Transcripts Official and complete transcripts of all work attempted at colleges and universities must be forwarded to OptomCAS by the institutions attended. Supplementary transcripts must be forwarded to OptomCAS following completion of courses not included on the original transcripts. Interview Process All admitted candidates must have been interviewed at the UAB School of Optometry. Applicants may be invited for an interview any time during a period beginning in September and ending as late as April. Additional Factors Considered by the Admissions Committee Scholastic Aptitude and Performance Successful completion of the optometry curriculum requires that a student be able to acquire a large amount of material in a limited time and have the ability to apply this material. In addition to the OAT scores and the overall college record, the UAB School of Optometry Admissions Committee considers whether students maintain or improve their performances as they progress to more advanced courses in their undergraduate curriculum. Extracurricular Activities Reasonable involvement in extracurricular activities is considered important. Community service and leadership qualities are also desirable. Optometry-Related Experience Applicants are required to explore the optometry field either by employment or in a volunteer\/job shadow capacity for at least 40 hours. Personality, Character and Motivation The personal and social traits and other non-intellectual characteristics important for the future optometrist are very difficult to measure objectively. The committee relies heavily on the letters of recommendation and\/or composite college evaluation, character recommendations and the interview for this information. Selection Process The UAB School of Optometry admits a target class size of 50 highly qualified students each year. The number of positions available for Alabama residents, Southern Regional Education Board state residents and non-resident applicants may vary from year to year.
