Administrative Council Getting to where you want to go Last academic year, Ouachita was one of the few universities to provide a fully in-person education. As we prepared for this year, we challenged ourselves to provide all the benefits of a traditional campus experience. Read More Casting a vision for a race run well Each year we select a theme to help us focus on Ouachita\u2019s essential purpose. That theme is based on our university\u2019s vision, mission and value statements. This year\u2019s theme is: \u201CVision, Integrity, Service.\u201D Each year, my convocation remarks introduce the theme. This morning, I want to spend a few moments to offer one perspective on the idea of \u201Cvision.\u201D Read More Progress is more about direction than speed: 2021 Commencement address I feel a special relationship with this graduating class. Many of you began in the fall of 2017, but we first met during your senior year in high school \u2013 my first year as president. We\u2019ve been on this journey for five years. Our kinship runs especially deep because of our shared struggles and shared responsibilities. The persistence of COVID-19 marked your entire senior year. We asked you to help us manage that threat, and you rose to the occasion. Read More Closing Thoughts: Progress in a pandemic In the midst of a pandemic, Ouachita\u2019s progress makes us an encouraging outlier in higher education. While total university enrollment in the country continues to decrease, Ouachita increases \u2013 our highest in 20 years. We\u2019re also graduating students at our highest level in history plus a placement rate of 97%. Read More Listening and leading toward biblical belonging Ouachita\u2019s progress in recent years reflects the input and ideas from listening to responses from two questions in regard to our future: \u201CWhat shouldn\u2019t change?\u201D and \u201CWhat should change?\u201D A part of our listening includes hearing the voices of our students and alumni of color. Until we listen, we can\u2019t understand how to make Ouachita a place where belonging is central to an outstanding educational experience. Read More GET IN TOUCH Have a question about Ouachita?
