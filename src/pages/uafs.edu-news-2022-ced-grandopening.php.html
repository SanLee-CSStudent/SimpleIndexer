Asa Hutchinson waxed poetic about the state of workforce development, economic investments, technology, and industry in the River Valley, and he noted the integral role the University of Arkansas \u2013 Fort Smith Center for Economic Development will play in continuing that legacy for years to come. \u201CThese are incredible times that we\u2019re living in,\u201D Hutchinson said, \u201CAnd it really goes to the heart of what\u2019s happening here in the River Valley. This center is the first of its kind in Arkansas, and I\u2019m extraordinarily proud that this innovation is here in this community.\u201D The university hosted a grand opening celebration and ribbon-cutting for the center, which will serve the River Valley as a destination for workforce and personal training, planning, and advising through the Center for Business and Professional Development, Arkansas Small Business and Technology Development Center, and the Family Enterprise Center on Wednesday, April 27, 2022, at the Bakery District. \u201CLet me tell you, Arkansas has its share of great entrepreneurs,\u201D Hutchinson continued, \u201CPeople who are willing to go out and invest capital, and to take risks because they want more in life. They want to create jobs; they want to be their own boss. That\u2019s the spirit of America, and it\u2019s reflected in the River Valley and this center that will be key in helping shape those entrepreneurs and providing them support.\u201D The governor noted that 64 percent of new jobs created across the country each year are created by small businesses, calling them the lifeblood of a community. \u201CFort Smith is growing; you can feel it in the air and in the leadership that\u2019s here.\u201D Center for Business and Professional Development director Kendall Ross discussed seeing the vision of the space come to life. Together, the three centers hosted within the CED serve every level of employer and employee in the River Valley. Dr. Terisa Riley, Chancellor, spoke about her first days in Fort Smith nearly three years ago, and a trip with Vice Chancellor Blake Rickman to, what she called a really \"cool\" space. \u201CThe truth is, I don\u2019t think what we did here is exactly what Bill Hanna or the Hanna Group conceptualized in this space when we walked through in 2019,\u201D she said, describing a space more focused on retail and industry. \u201CBut when we walked through, I said, \u2018What if all of that starts because of what we do in this space? What if it grows and becomes something you could never have even conceived before we had this place?\u2019\u201D \u201CWhat we hope to achieve here is that the visionary people of Fort Smith, who start with a concept in their minds, will have an opportunity to learn how to create business plans and marketing plans, will learn how to get loans and be trained on almost every conceivable aspect of the business, right here,\u201D she continued. \u201CAnd guess what? It\u2019s really cool. Everyone wants to be here.\u201D In addition to Riley, Ross, and Hutchinson, speakers included Michael Barr, chair of the UAFS Board of Visitors; Dr. Latisha Settlage, dean of the College of Business and Industry; and Bill Hanna, secretary of the UAFS Foundation Board and president of Hanna Oil and Gas. The center had a soft opening in January of 2022 and has since provided solutions for more than 250 individuals and 23 different organizations in the Bakery District. On Wednesday, more than 300 guests filled the space \u2013 embarking on site tours and learning about the wide array of offerings housed within the space.
