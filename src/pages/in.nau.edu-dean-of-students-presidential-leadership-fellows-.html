The program will focus in the following areas: Modeling the Way, Inspiring a Shared a Vision, Challenging the Process, Enabling Others to Act, and Encouraging the Heart. A common thread throughout the program is the need to discuss and reflect upon diversity, inclusion, and equity. We will thread social justice throughout the program so we can all work toward building a more equitable world. Our aim is for students to leave each session empowered to make positive change, influence others, and create inclusive, equitable experiences for all. Who should attend Eligible students will be sophomores and juniors in Fall 2022 with at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Eligible students will also display outstanding leadership potential through their involvement and contributions to Northern Arizona University, across a diverse array of leadership experiences and academic disciplines. Twenty to thirty participants will be selected as Fellows this year. How to apply The application period is closed for Fall 2021. For any questions, please email Michelle.Gardner@nau.edu.
