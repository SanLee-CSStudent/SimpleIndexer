NPC offers a variety of internet-based classes which are helpful for those with busy schedules or having difficulty in physically attending classes. To be successful, NPC online students need certain skills (familiarity with email, web browsers, word processors) and a high degree of self discipline and motivation. You'll also need consistent access to a computer and your own email account. FIRST, read these important facts about NPC Online Classes. 1. Complete an Application ALL NEW STUDENTS must complete the new student application form. Once processed, you will be issued the log-in information needed to complete the course registration process on MyNPC. If you are ONLY enrolling in the Teacher Certification Classes (AZ Constitution\/Government and U.S. Constitution, POS 221 & 222), the teacher certification course registration form will allow you to complete the application form AND register for these courses at one time. You will receive a confirmation email with instructions for starting your classes. POS 221 & 222 classes can be started at any time within the semester \u2013 but MUST completed within one year of registering. See the \"Classes for Teachers\" section for more teacher courses. Complete a New Student Application Form CURRENT STUDENTS: Log-in to MyNPC to register for courses. 2. Use Class Schedule Search to Find Online Courses You MUST have the Course Code for each course you wish to register for. Example: BUS 105-15. To find this information, go to NPC's class schedule search You will need to select the semester you plan to enroll in. Check NPC's current academic calendar for semester start and end dates. Select the correct Term (semester) and year. Example: SP 2019 (spring semester 2019). Leave all the other menus\/fields as they are and skip down to Campus (fourth from the bottom). Under Campus, select Internet. Leave the last three settings as they are and click the Search button. This will take you to a page that lists ALL of the internet-based courses NPC offers for that semester. Scroll to find your desired course(s). Write down the Course Code. Example: BUS 105-15. You'll need it for every online course for which you plan to register. You will need to also pay attention to the following items in the class schedule search: In the Status column, you can see whether the course is still accepting enrollment (open\/closed). In the Seats Open column, the first number is how many seats are open and the second number is the maximum number of enrollments allowed in that class. [Example: 8\/20 -- 8 seats are still available out of a maximum of 20 enrollments.] Be sure to check the Beginning and Ending Dates. Some short-term classes have different start dates from the regular semester. The Note column tells you whether you must concurrently enroll in a separate hands-on lab section and other important information. (Not all classes have notes.) Clicking the Course Code link presents any required prerequisites, the course description and textbook information. Return to this page when you're done to complete the rest of the enrollment steps. TAKING BOTH ONLINE AND ON-SITE CLASSES? (online ONLY is EXEMPT) All new NPC students or those who have earned 12 or fewer credits must register for and complete a one-time, two-and-a-half-hour, noncredit Student Success Strategies orientation class. Students who fail to complete orientation before the end of the following semester will be blocked from future registration. Computer Skills Test NPC has implemented a program to improve student learning in online classes. Students enrolled in an NPC internet class for the first time are required to demonstrate or develop basic skills necessary for online learning. Students need to complete the Online Readiness Course by the end of the first week of class. Visit https:\/\/sites.google.com\/mail.npc.edu\/itcs\/eresources\/readiness for more information about the procedure and requirements. (POS 221 & 222 are exempt from the Readiness Skills Requirement.) 3. Login to MyNPC and Register for Classes Once you have a login to MyNPC you are ready to register for online classes.

Verify Your Residency Arizona voters passed Proposition 300, which requires Northland Pioneer College to verify the U.S. residency status of all students.

Find out what documents are acceptable (click on the residency tab). If you live outside NPC's service area, you can submit your residency verification via EMAIL by taking a photo of your verifying document or scanning it.

Pay for Classes Pay your tuition and course fees ONLY AFTER you receive email confirmation from NPC that you are enrolled in class(es)! Submission of the online class registration form does NOT guarantee your enrollment. Check the payment due date schedule to see when your tuition and fee payment is due. Failure to pay or to make payment arrangements by these deadlines means you will be dropped from your class(es). Payment Options: Pay by PHONE with a VISA or MasterCard, by calling the NPC Business Office at (800) 266-7845, ext. 7480. Use the eCashier Payment Plan, an ONLINE payment option. Pay in person at any NPC campus or center location. NOTE: Students may be charged an additional fee for use of electronic textbook materials in some online courses. This fee will be charged upon initial log-in to the online course. See the current fee schedule to find out what other fees may apply. REMINDER: First-time online students must complete the free, one-time Online Readiness Module listed under step 1, \"How To Begin.\" 6. Textbooks Check to see if you need to order textbooks (some online courses don't use them). You'll need the course number for each of the online classes you registered for. Use the NPC Online Bookstore to see if you need to order the textbook(s). You are not required to order your textbooks through the NPC Online Bookstore, BUT if you order from a different vendor be sure to use the ISBN number to ensure you get the correct book(s)! 7.

Instructions on how to start your online class are in Moodle.
