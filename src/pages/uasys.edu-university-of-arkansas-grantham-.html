Founded in 1951, Grantham University developed as part of the traditional college and university movement of the late 20th century with a main campus in Southern California. As interest in Grantham\u2019s degree programs grew beyond campus boundaries, the college developed distance education programs to serve a geographically dispersed student body. Over time, and as technology advanced, so too did our ability to serve our students. Since 2000, Grantham began offering degree programs exclusively online. In late 2021, Grantham University joined the University of Arkansas System and officially became the University of Arkansas Grantham. UA Grantham is now a stronger institution with greater ability to serve the thousands of students already enrolled in more than 60 fully-online degree and certificate programs.
