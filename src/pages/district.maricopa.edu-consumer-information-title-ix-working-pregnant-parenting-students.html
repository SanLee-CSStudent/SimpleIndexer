This goal includes our pregnant and\/or parenting students. As is outlined in Maricopa\u2019s Non-Discrimination policy as well as the requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, students will not be discriminated against on the basis of a disclosed pregnancy. This includes discrimination against a student based on pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions. As a result, a pregnant or parenting student (a student during a defined postpartum period lasting up to 8 weeks after delivery), may be provided adjustments so they are able to access and participate in their educational program or activity. Adjustments are available through college Title IX Coordinators (or their designees). In the event of certain pregnancy-related medical complications, the college Disability Resource Services (DRS) office may assist in providing accommodations\/ academic adjustments. What are my rights as a pregnant or parenting student? As a pregnant or parenting student, MCCCD understands that you have a lot on your mind. In the weeks and months ahead, as you work with your Title IX Coordinator and with your professors around specific needs and\/or missed class, feel free to make use of the information on this page. Pregnant and parenting students have certain rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (known as \"Title IX\"), which is federal legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex (including pregnancy and parental status) in educational programs and activities. What Should I Expect? Pregnant and parenting students should expect to obtain reasonable adjustments based on their pregnant and parenting status in order to maintain access to the educational environment. These students are expected to be proactive in requesting these adjustments and willing to work with Title IX Coordinators for appropriate adjustments. MCCCD is unable to grant retroactive adjustments, so it is important to reach out early with requests. Reasonable Adjustments \u2013MCCCD is required to provide reasonable adjustments to provide access for pregnant and parenting students. Some examples of reasonable adjustments may include: a larger desk elevator access breaks during class, as needed rescheduling tests or exams excusing absences due to pregnancy or related conditions submitting work after a deadline missed due to pregnancy or childbirth providing alternatives to make up missed work allowing excused absences for parenting students (both male and female) who need to take their children to medical appointments or to take care of their sick children) providing private areas for breastfeeding Excused Absences \u2013 Absences related to pregnancy or childbirth must be excused for as long as these absences are related to pregnancy and parenting status and are supported by appropriate documentation. Students should request support from their college Title IX Coordinator by accessing the Pregnancy Adjustment Form below. Beyond the requirements of Title IX, students with children may need to be absent in order to care for a sick child, cover a gap in child care\/schooling, or other emergencies, and Instructors are encouraged to carefully consider accommodating such absences. Make-Up Work \u2013 Students returning to class must be allowed to return to the same academic status as before the medical leave or absences began and given the opportunity to make up any work missed during the leave\/absences. This includes an opportunity to make-up \"participation\" points that a student missed by virtue of not being in class. Further, any deadlines that were missed during the leave must be extended to allow submission of work. Withdrawal \u2013 Students who find themselves needing to withdraw from classes should speak with their College Title IX Coordinator to discuss how the time off would affect the student's academic progress. Further, students who receive financial aid should meet with the Office of Financial Aid to learn what implications, if any, the withdrawal has on aid. It is important to note that pregnant or parenting students are held to the level of academic standards and must meet the learning objectives that have been set for the course. Students must work with their Title IX Coordinators in order to determine what accommodations are reasonable so as to allow the student to complete all work while also achieving course outcomes. How do I request adjustments? Adjustment requests should be directed to the college Title IX Coordinator by accessing the Pregnancy Adjustment Form. The Coordinator will review the request, possibly meeting with the student to discuss the pregnant or parenting individual\u2019s needs, and in some cases may ask for documentation that supports the requested adjustments. Pregnancy Adjustment Form Important Contacts Title IX Coordinator \u2013 The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the College's efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX. The Title IX Coordinator oversees the College\u2019s response to all reports or complaints of incidents of discrimination based on sex.
