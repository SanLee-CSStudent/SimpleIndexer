Staff Corporate Matching Gifts Double Your Impact! Your gift can be doubled, even tripled, through employer matching gift programs. More than 7,500 companies offer matching gift programs to their employees, and some offer the option to retirees. These companies will send a donation that matches, doubles or maybe even triples the amount an employee gives to a non-profit, charitable organization. Your matched gift will make you eligible for recognition in certain giving levels that are listed in university publications. Check and see if your company has a matching gift program by contacting the UCA Foundation at (501) 450-5288 or (800) 981-4426 or by using the online matching gift finder.
