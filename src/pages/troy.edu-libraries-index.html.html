COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY Overview Troy University traces its origins to the Troy Normal School, which was established on February 26, 1887. Library collections at that time consisted of a few donated volumes. Since then, the Library has grown and continues to assist the student body, faculty, and staff in achieving the goals of the University. Primary responsibility for the planned direction of collection development and policy decision making rests with the Troy University Library collection development librarians and ultimately with the Dean of University Libraries. Each of these subject librarians implement and maintain a formal faculty liaison structure with assigned departments or schools to insure that the library is informed of program needs and changes. This policy pertains to materials both physical and electronic, and to materials in all formats, including serials, monographs, and audio-visual sources, as well as aggregated resources such as electronic databases. This policy is intended to provide guidance for the creation of a library collection that provides access to library materials in appropriate formats that are of sufficient quality, depth, number, scope, and currency to: meet all students\u2019 needs in fulfilling course assignments; enrich the academic programs; meet teaching and research needs; support curricular needs; facilitate the acquisition of lifelong learning skills; accommodate other informational needs of the community as appropriate. MATERIAL SPECIFIC POLICY Physical Content Versus Electronic Access In regard to materials available both as physical content and via electronic access, this issue shall be considered. Access Versus Ownership In regard to electronic materials for content that is available for acquisition on a permanent basis, i.e., owned, this issue shall be considered. Replacements Decisions about replacements are made on a case-by-case basis. Acquisition of Print Monographs Paperback books When there is a significant difference in price between hardcover and paperback books, and the book would not be in frequent demand or the book will be outdated in a short period of time, paperbacks are bought to save funds. Multiple copies and duplicates In order to provide the broadest range of materials to support the academic curriculum, the University Library will not normally buy multiple copies. Duplicates are purchased only under unusual circumstances as determined by circulation, reference needs and allocations. Textbooks Textbooks and their accompanying materials tend to be outdated rapidly. The Library does not use operational funds to purchase textbooks that are currently used in classes. The exception to this is classic textbooks in the technical, scientific, and business areas, which have become standard reference and review sources. Another exception is the purchase of textbooks for the teacher education program. Out of Print Materials The Library will not purchase out of print materials unless the requested items are an important addition to the collection. Acquisition of Serials The acquisition of serials requires a higher degree of selectivity and consideration than that of monographs because of ongoing commitment in terms of costs (including ongoing access to materials if in electronic format), binding, and storage. Serial Publications Defined A serial is a publication issued in successive parts bearing numeric or chronological designations and intended to be continued indefinitely. Periodicals, newspapers, and annuals are serial publications. Periodical: These are journals, magazines, and newspapers issued and received on a regular basis and are put into the Periodical Collection. Annuals\/Continuations: Serials which are received, classified, and cataloged and are integrated into the Library collection other than the Periodical Collection. Types of continuations include monographic series, supplements, yearbooks, proceedings of conferences, and bibliographic indexes. ASSESSMENTS AND POLICIES BY DISCIPLINE Collection Intensity The Troy University Libraries use the following collection intensity levels. 1. Minimal Level: A subject area in which few selections are made beyond very basic materials. 2. Basic Information Level: A collection of up\u2011to\u2011date general materials that serves to introduce and define a subject. 3. Instructional Support Level: A collection that is closely tied to the needs of the curriculum. 3A Undergraduate Support Level: A collection that is adequate to support undergraduate instruction. 3B Upper Level\/Graduate Support Level: A collection that is adequate to support undergraduate instruction and most upper level \/ graduate instruction or independent studies. 4.

The item selection profile is based in part on the recommended core collection for a small academic library as addressed in the Federal Depository Library Manual Desktop online. Campus Connection Subject emphasis for the documents collection has been placed in the areas of criminal justice, economics, education, health, military history, and politics that support the curricula of Troy University. The additional areas of small business law and census are selected to help supply the information needs of all interested parties. Formats The collection includes pamphlets, books, microfiche, and reports.

Level of Collection Intensity Not applicable. Treatment of the Subject The Government Document print collection, numbering approximately 4,000 items, is well-rounded for the material identified for the Troy University depository program. Material use varies from curriculum to curriculum and year-to-year. Government Printing Office (GPO) posters are displayed at the entrance and throughout the Library, informing the patrons that the Troy University Library is a United States Government Documents depository. Librarians and many of the staff are familiar with the location and methods to access this information. The GPO\u2019s move to online access of Government Documents has greatly decreased the size of the physical collection and drastically increased the electronic collection of the Troy University Library. The electronic documents can be accessed through the govinfo database, which is located on the Library\u2019s databases page. The Government Document Librarian makes item selection with input from subject specialists. The item selection profile is evaluated annually, at which time additions and deletions are made. Suggestions for additions and deletions are requested from the subject specialists as they evaluate specific areas of the general collection. The majority of the U.S. government documents collection is classified by Superintendent of Documents Classification (SuDoc) number and is shelved in the Government Documents area. Selected series such as United States Reports and Area Handbooks are cataloged using the Library of Congress method. The subject specialists may request cataloging of specified documents. These publications, if soft bound, are rebound before being added to the general collection. Duplicates received as gifts may be added if use indicates or fills a void due to loss or damage. Geographic areas such as Alabama, Pike County, and the southeastern states are emphasized. Librarians can provide service to the patron if information outside this region is required. The collection has a broad coverage in terms of chronology in some areas. Current information is emphasized in most areas. The collection language is primarily English. As documents are received, they are identified with a SuDoc number, in ink, affixed to the document. A staff member is responsible for the check-in of the documents and the affixing of the SuDoc number. Weeding is done annually each summer, or at other times as deemed appropriate by the Government Document Librarian, and disposed of in accordance with the GPO guidelines. Some superseded documents may be retained in order to fulfill any continuity issues that may be pertinent to a specific field for research purposes. This is on an exception basis only due to limited storage space. Government documents may circulate according to the same criteria applied to the general collection: a three-week loan period or as otherwise specified. Documents classified as reference do not circulate. All publications are available for in-house use during the hours the library is open. If a Government Document is brought to Circulation for checkout and a record cannot be found, a Librarian will make a temporary record using OCLC Worldshare.
