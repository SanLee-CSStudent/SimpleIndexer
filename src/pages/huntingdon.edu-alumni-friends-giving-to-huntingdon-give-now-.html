Without the collective generosity of the Huntingdon alumni and friends in support of the Huntingdon Fund, every student would pay more in tuition each year. The Huntingdon Arts Fund: This fund supports the fine arts programs of the College and the many cultural events that populate the College calendar each year. Hawks Unlimited: Huntingdon proudly boasts 20 NCAA Division III athletic teams. Gifts to Hawks Unlimited support all of the College\u2019s athletic programs in their pursuit of excellence. The Patricia Guy Legacy Fund: Established in 2021 by the Alumni Engagement Team of the Race and Justice Initiative, the fund honors Patricia Guy \u201969, Huntingdon\u2019s first Black student and graduate, and provides financial aid support for current Black students. The Student Alumni Association: Founded in 2013, the SAA collects $10 membership gifts from members of the student body to support the Huntingdon Fund. > Give Online To donate by mail, send your check, payable to Huntingdon College (indicate gift designation on the \u201Cnotes\u201D line), to: Office of College and Alumni Relations Huntingdon College 1500 East Fairview Avenue Montgomery, AL 36106 Popular Links Houghton Library Registrar's Office Student Financial Services Center for Career and Vocation Ability Sport Network Online Student Account Payments Emergency Procedures CARE Team Cayzu - Service Request System Facebook-f Instagram Twitter Linkedin-in webmaster@hawks.huntingdon.edu Search Huntingdon College is a college of the United Methodist Church.
