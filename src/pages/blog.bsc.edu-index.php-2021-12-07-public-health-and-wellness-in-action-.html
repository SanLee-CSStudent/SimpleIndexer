He was not allowed to come out of his house until he was 16 years old because his parents were worried about him getting hurt. Because of that specific exposure I had to preventable blindness \u2013 I was already planning on going to public health school \u2013 I also applied to optometry school.\u201D During that E-Term trip, Gupta learned that Vitamin A deficiency and measles were the most common causes of blindness in that region, which is something you almost never hear about in the United States, she says. With her experience that prevention is at the core of public health, it has become one of the most important aspects of Gupta\u2019s work in medicine. People ask her what terms like \u201Cpublic health\u201D and \u201Cwellness\u201D really mean. Both have become more familiar over the last few years, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but they are still newer within the traditional realms of medicine. \u201CPeople think of health care as going to the doctor when you don\u2019t feel well,\u201D she explains, \u201Cbut public health is promoting the health of a community so that fewer people are unwell. With \u2018sick,\u2019 you think of cold and flu. \u2018Unwell\u2019 includes substance use disorders, mental health issues, and even obesity.\u201D As health services director for Aletheia House since August 2020, Gupta directs some of the most impactful public health initiatives in the Birmingham area. Aletheia House has served the community for almost 50 years, primarily focused on a wide range of services for those experiencing homelessness. \u201CAletheia House has allowed me to return to community health,\u201D Gupta says. \u201CThe positions that optometry opened up for me helped me have a greater impact. Now, I\u2019m back in our local community. I had to go around the globe to return to where I started and to where I want to make the most impact.\u201D After graduating from BSC with degrees in biology and psychology, Gupta earned her Master of Public Health from UAB and then attended the Illinois College of Optometry. Degrees in hand, she went to work in a traditional clinic, but it wasn\u2019t the right fit for her. \u201CI did not feel satisfied,\u201D she says. \u201CI did not feel like I was doing enough public health.\u201D While working in a clinic in New York City, Gupta began adding one day a week at Helen Keller International, which combats the causes and consequences of vision loss around the world, and she found her path back to public health. She later spent seven years living in Gurgaon, India, and served as an associate professor in Sushant University\u2019s School of Health Sciences. She got to teach \u201Ceverything that was so important to my heart,\u201D specifically public health practices in health care. \u201CIn public health, we have a broader scope of health care so that we reach more people,\u201D Gupta says, \u201Cand a key aspect of public health is prevention. The more we can prevent, the less we have to treat. And treatment is expensive and sometimes inaccessible.\u201D The public health principles at the core of her classes are integral to Aletheia House\u2019s mission, too. As the health services director, Gupta oversees how grant funds can support the initiatives within their services, including primary care and mental health care. She pulls from her public health education as well as her clinic experience to help organize specific initiatives. Her position has also put her in charge of COVID-19 protocols over the last year. For Aletheia House, protocols first covered how the organization could run shelters while preventing the spread of the virus. In January 2021, Aletheia\u2019s clinic was one of Jefferson County\u2019s first vaccination sites and is one of the only sites that still serves a primarily underserved population. \u201CWhere do the uninsured go? Where do people who don\u2019t have regular transportation go? We were the ones reaching out to them,\u201D Gupta says. \u201CBefore we had the mobile health unit, we would pick them up and bring them on site.\u201D The mobile health unit has changed the game for outreach, and it\u2019s been one of the tools to offer testing and vaccinations to the community. Gupta hopes through her work in vulnerable communities, Aletheia House can consistently improve public health education and illness prevention. \u201CWhen we prevent, we keep people healthier,\u201D she says. \u201CAn important part of what I strive to do is provide care to people who have it the least and getting out into their communities and teaching prevention.\u201D This story was included in a special health careers edition of From the Hilltop, Birmingham-Southern\u2019s alumni email newsletter.
