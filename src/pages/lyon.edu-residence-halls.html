Single, full-time students under 21 years of age may commute daily from the home of their parents or legal guardians if within 30 miles of the campus. Students who are veterans, reside with their spouse, or are 21 years of age or older may reside off campus provided that they have informed the director of campus life in writing prior to the asssignment of on-campus housing. The dean of students must approve any exception to these policies. Community-style bathrooms are single-gender bathrooms shared with all residents on the floor. Maintenance maintains these bathrooms. Suite-style bathrooms are bathrooms between two rooms that residents of those rooms maintain. Residents must supply their own cleaning supplies.
