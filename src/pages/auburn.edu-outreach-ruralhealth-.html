Previous Next Auburn University\u2019s Rural Health Project employs a community-based approach to serve local healthcare needs through the innovative technology of the OnMed¢ç Telehealth Station coupled with hands-on wellness care provided by University faculty and students. Overview Participants Funders Location Services FAQs Contact Background University Outreach is addressing significant health disparities across rural Alabama in partnership with Pharmacy, Nursing, Human Sciences, and the Alabama Cooperative Extension System. This accessible and innovative healthcare option combines the state-of-the art OnMed¢ç telehealth station with hands-on wellness care provided through university faculty and students in health-related fields. The telehealth station provides users with a an affordable, private and efficient experience by facilitating a real-time patient encounter with an Alabama licensed clinician in a virtual setting through the use of diagnostic tools available for practitioner-guided self-use. The Auburn University team members have worked closely with leaders from the City of LaFayette, Alabama and the Chambers County Commission to develop and launch this project. This collaboration resulted in identifying a vacated health clinic as the ideal location for the Chambers County Community Health and Wellness Center. Once complete, The Center will engage university students and faculty from diverse disciplines with community members to support their overall well-being. Nursing students will support diabetes management and asthma education. Pharmacy students will provide medication management education. Speech, language and hearing students will support communication needs. Ongoing COVID-19 vaccinations and testing will be provided during all hours of operation. Examples of other disciplines committed to engagement are kinesiology, social work, nutrition science, human development and family science, and counseling. Timeline Discussions and regional convenings to focus upon solutions to address rural health disparities with campus and community-based partners began in October 2020. The team formalized their commitment to launch the rural health project in Chambers County through a Memorandum of Understanding in August of 2021.
