The human brain is a magical, mysterious thing. It sits at the center of our thoughts, emotions and physical response to the world around us. It perceives, detects, processes and reacts \u2014 often with no conscious effort on our part \u2014 to sights, smells, sounds, tastes and touches that bring us joy, sadness, fear, pain, satisfaction and knowledge. Yet, despite having an entire branch of science devoted to its study, researchers still have much to learn about how the brain is structured, the ways in which it develops, how it operates flawlessly or malfunctions without warning \u2014 and even how it can be changed. It was a desire to learn more about the latter \u2014 the plasticity of the brain and its ability to be altered \u2014 that drew Robin Lester, Ph.D., to the field and ultimately to UAB where he spent 17 of the past 25 years as an NIH R01-funded principal investigator. Here he developed a national reputation for research into the effects of addiction, but it may be his commitment to education that is his most enduring legacy. For decades now, Lester also educated professional students in the schools of Medicine, Dentistry and Optometry \u2014 to great acclaim from his students \u2014 and he recently extended his reach to undergraduates. \"Few faculty demonstrate the intellectual agility or eagerness to challenge themselves to adapt teaching across so many levels.\u201D Admittedly, when he joined UAB as an associate scientist in the Neurobiology Research Center in 1995, teaching was \u201Cnot at the forefront\u201D of his aspirations. But he discovered he enjoyed the learning that came with teaching. He also discovered it was not so dissimilar to research. \u201CIn teaching, you have you keep things fresh. Just like bench science. You have to keep up to date with the material and the teaching methods,\u201D said Lester, now a professor of neurobiology. \u201CYou have to approach learning from the student\u2019s perspective \u2014 what they find interesting \u2014 and build on that.\u201D Craig Powell, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the Department of Neurobiology, weighs in with effusive praise for Lester\u2019s ability to do just that. \u201CHis presentation style and engaging course designs are unparalleled,\u201D Powell said. \u201CHe draws from every available mode of instruction with the possible exception of interpretive dance. Few faculty demonstrate the intellectual agility or eagerness to challenge themselves to adapt teaching across so many levels.\u201D These are a few of the reasons Lester will receive the 2021 Ellen Gregg Ingalls\/UAB National Alumni Society Award for Lifetime Achievement in Teaching. The award is presented annually to a full-time UAB faculty member who, throughout their 20-plus year career at UAB, demonstrates an outstanding commitment to teaching. Lester will be formally recognized during the annual Faculty Convocation in November. A long way to get here UAB long has been an international melting pot for students and faculty, and Lester, a British citizen with permanent U.S. residency, adds his own flavor to the mix. He hails from Liverpool, England, a city famous as the birthplace of the Beatles and for its football (the other kind); it\u2019s a port city about a two-hour drive from Birmingham (the U.K. one). As a student, Lester attended the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree, with honors, in 1984 and his doctoral degree in 1988. Then, he said, he became part of the \u201Cbrain drain of the 1980s,\u201D a period in which increasing numbers of students, postdocs and other professionals left their native countries seeking better pay, better resources and otherwise unavailable opportunities that could be found in America. For Lester the elusive opportunity was a position in a lab pursuing research in synaptic plasticity and addictions. At the time, \u201Cthe exact type of research and the technologies needed to conduct it were only available in a few places,\u201D Lester said. That search took him to Portland, where he completed his postdoctoral training at Oregon Health & Science University\u2019s Vollum Institute in 1991. His first academic appointment followed at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, Texas, from 1992 to 1995. Rising to the top Lester joined UAB as an associate scientist in the Neurobiology Research Center in 1995. From there he rose through the ranks to assistant and associate professor, and he was nominated for Argus awards by students in the School Medicine for best course, best lecturer and best organ module in neurosciences and received the 2010 President\u2019s Award for Excellence in Teaching for the Department of Joint Health Sciences. He became a full professor in 2011, and the accolades from students continued to accumulate. Specifically, he has taught in the UAB School of Medicine Neuroscience Module since 1996, and he has been the course director for most of these years. He also directed the combined neuroscience course for the schools of Dentistry and Optometry from 2006 to 2012 and continues to teach in this course. During this time, Lester said he came to realize that \u201Cteaching is a part of science that is as important as research.\u201D In this ever-expanding field, he tries to present digestible information across of range of topics using various presentation forms and engage students to use their knowledge in innovative ways. \u201CSometimes less is more,\u201D he said. \u201CYou can overwhelm students if you present too much.\u201D \u201DUAB has given me a great deal of freedom to be creative. That is satisfying. And fun.\u201D More recently, Lester has designed, directed and instructed four courses for the university\u2019s highly successful undergraduate neuroscience program, including 100 Things to Know About the Brain. \u201CThat course grew out of my fascination with TED talks and podcasts,\u201D he said. In it, he introduces students to concepts not generally discussed in neuroscience studies, such as mind-reading, consciousness, dreaming and the perception of time. His newest course for UAB Honors College students, Strange Brains: How Myths and Legends Shaped the History of Neuroscience, explores the early understanding of the brain by ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans and moves from the myths to modern science. Gauging success in the classroom is a little harder than it is for research, which relies on more objective metrics such as the number of grants and publications. \u201CTeachers rely on evaluations and feedback from students \u2014 anything that tells you that you had an impact on their educational experience,\u201D he said. \u201COne of the things that gets lost in any job is how much overall satisfaction one gets from it,\u201D Lester said. \u201CThis type of position gives me a lot of freedom. UAB has given me a great deal of freedom to be creative. That is satisfying. And fun.\u201D Lester says he is looking forward and expects to teach a few more years. \u201CI still have a course I\u2019m developing, and I expect I\u2019ll teach as long as I\u2019m evolving,\u201D he said.
