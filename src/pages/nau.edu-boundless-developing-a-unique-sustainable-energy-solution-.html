Zachariah Bess has a special quality in the lab: what organic chemistry Professor Cindy Browder calls \u201Cgolden hands.\u201D This quality, a blend of nimbleness, knowledge, experience, and intuition, helps him work through chemical reactions, searching for solutions to problems in the lab. Bess has another special quality: perseverance. His determination to succeed\u2014and willingness to ask for help\u2014has helped him get to where he is today. He will graduate this spring with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Chemistry, certified by the American Chemical Society. But he almost didn\u2019t come back after a very trying freshman year. He is proud to be here now. \u201CI would say that I am most proud of the fact that I was able to resume my education at NAU and not only make it to my last year, but to be the undergraduate researcher I am,\u201D says Bess. He plans on pursuing a PhD in organic chemistry to gain a broader background in neurochemistry research. His goal is personal\u2014he has family members and friends who have not done well with their prescribed medications, so he would like to find help for them. But right now, he is focusing on continuing to build a solid research foundation. \u201CI took this on in my sophomore to junior year and was an undergrad researcher in a group that\u2019s predominantly upper-level students,\u201D Bess says. \u201CTo be one of the younger ones in a group and to be able to hold my own really motivates me to keep going with my education and career path.\u201D Zachariah Bess For the past two years, Bess has been working on two research projects in Browder\u2019s lab. For one project, Bess is creating an antifungal solution for biochemistry professor Andy Koppisch\u2019s lab using amino acids. \u201CBasically, it\u2019s like an antibiotic but for fungi, specifically fungus that grows on plants,\u201D Bess explains. \u201CSo, I\u2019ve been working on making an antifungal solution that you can spray on plants and break down the fungus without harming the plant.\u201D \u201CThe second project is still using the same medium as we did with the antifungal solution\u2014ionic liquids prepared from amino acids\u2014but this time we\u2019re using the ionic liquids to make solid electrolytes,\u201D says Bess, an Urdea Undergraduate Research Award recipient. Browder points out that this project aims to find a material that can conduct electricity safely and offer a sustainable energy solution. \u201CSolid electrolytes are really the way of the future,\u201D she shares, explaining that solid polymers are able to hold their shape and aren\u2019t easily distorted, unlike something gelatinous. Yet at the molecular level, they have liquid properties, allowing ions to move freely. \u201CZachariah is taking on a really important challenge in our group, which is to make the polymers from bio-derived and potentially biodegradable materials,\u201D Browder says. \u201CWe\u2019re looking to have something that\u2019s completely sustainable.\u201D Bess enjoys the challenge. He sees this as an opportunity to help society become less dependent on oil. \u201CI think this is a very big step in where we need to go,\u201D he says. \u201COil is a fossil fuel, not an unlimited resource. When we run out, we\u2019re still going to want to be able to be on our phones and be on laptops and be able to do the same things we do, so we need to start thinking of ways to keep that going.\u201D He credits Browder with helping him strengthen his research skills and hopes to continue in her lab as he pursues his master\u2019s degree. Browder explains that allowing undergraduate students to work on actual research projects gives them first-hand experience with the scientific method. \u201CAs a researcher, you need to learn resiliency to power through the many, many failures before you have success in the lab,\u201D she says. \u201CAnd when you do have those successes, you have to be so methodical, so you understand why this particular combination of things worked.\u201D Browder notices Zachariah paying close attention to the behaviors of molecules. \u201CAnd so, when he sees an outcome that\u2019s not quite what we want, he goes back to what the behavior was between those molecules that didn\u2019t quite go right and asks, \u2018What can I do to push that in the right direction?\u2019\u201D Before Bess started his research, he needed to get past his difficult freshman year. \u201CI started school in 2017, and then I had a very rough freshman year with life and family things and financial things,\u201D he says. He credits NAU advisor Helen Hemmer for helping him get back to NAU. Hemmer helped him figure out how to take classes at home in Chicago, Illinois, to transfer to NAU. \u201CShe cared enough to still be my advisor and wanted to make sure that I was able to graduate and finish what I started,\u201D Bess shares. \u201CShe also made sure that when I got here, I had everything in order. She impacted my life, more than anybody, ever.\u201D Because of the support he has received and confidence gained from lab experience, Bess is ready to apply his \u201Cgolden hands\u201D to a science career after graduating from NAU. Bess will give a poster presentation on his solid electrolyte research during the Undergraduate Research Symposium, along with fellow researcher and Urdea award recipient Logan Schubert, a Mechanical Engineering student.
