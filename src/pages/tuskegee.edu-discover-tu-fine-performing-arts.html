Fine & Performing Arts Fine & Performing Arts Mission Statement The Department of Fine & Performing Arts seeks to expose students to the arts including its history, cultural relevance and societal influence with particular emphasis on the works by artists and musicians of color. We introduce students to a bevy of artists (both visual and performing) who are local and\/or internationally known craftspeople. This department is uniquely positioned to provide hands-on experience in art appreciation and musical development in a university known for its excellence and attention to fine detail. The members of the department firmly believe the arts are an integral part of students\u2019 educational experience and prepare them for careers either in the arts or in areas influenced (directly or indirectly) by the arts. Our degree programs allow students to graduate and utilize their talents to serve as ambassadors that enrich the lives of others in service to their respective communities, their workplaces and the world at large. Objective & Scope of Program The fine arts are an essential part of any university's curriculum. The arts teach students about expressing creativity, critical analysis, and diversity. As an inherently interdisciplinary area of study, drawing on aesthetics, design, and history, among other disciplines, The fine arts fit well into the mission of Tuskegee University to graduate global-minded citizens who are truly prepared to apply their talents of aesthetics, musical acumen, design and other disciplines to create, understand, and evaluate art in its various modes. The Bachelor of Arts degree will be conferred on those who successfully complete the majors of Art and Music, and, eventually, the Performing Arts. Our successful graduates will be \u201Ccompetent, credentialed and comprehensively developed individuals.\u201D Admission Requirements\/Visual Arts Applicants are required to submit a portfolio of their artwork. In addition, all applicants are required to perform an audition heard by specific members of the faculty. Artistic\/creative analysis, history, and other skills learned in the course of the student\u2019s academic career may be applied during the Special Topics phase of matriculation, thereby elevating the student\u2019s artistic awareness.
