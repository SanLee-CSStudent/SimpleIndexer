Mission Statement: The Saints CARE Team (Communicate, Assess, Refer, Educate) is committed to maintaining individual and overall faculty, staff, and student safety and well-being through pro-active and collaborative prevention, assessment, and intervention. Purpose Statement: The Saints CARE Team helps find solutions for students who experience academic, social, personal and crisis situations including mental health concerns. Members of the college community can confidentially report a concern for a student who may benefit from these services. We review these reports to understand each student issue and the on- and off-campus resources that may guide them to success. The Saints CARE Team steps in to connect students with relevant campus resources and outside agencies. Most times, we may need to communicate with the reporting party to help accurately assess the needs of the student. The Saints CARE Team will also outreach to the student to understand his or her situation and develop a plan of action leading towards his or her success.
