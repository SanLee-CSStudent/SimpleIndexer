In all cases, you must see your international student advisor (DSO) before beginning employment. F-1 students may work on campus for up to 20 hours per week (in total) while school is in session. New F-1 students (initial entry) may work on campus prior to the commencement of classes but no earlier than 30 days prior to the I-20 program start date. Transfer students may begin work at Lyon after the transfer release date, but no sooner than 30 days before the program start date on their Lyon I-20. To be eligible for on-campus employment, an F-1 student must be enrolled as a full-time student and remain full-time. If you wish to pursue on-campus employment, you will need to apply for a Social Security Number (SSN). Employers and employees use an SSN for the purpose of reporting individual employee earnings for tax purposes. The SSN is valid for life, so you need only apply once. All F-1 students who have secured on campus employment are eligible for an SSN. For more information on how to apply for an SNN, click here.
