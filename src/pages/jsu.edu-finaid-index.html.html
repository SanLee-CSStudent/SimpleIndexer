If you or your family's financial situation has changed significantly from what is reflected on your federal income tax return (i.e.: job loss, death of a parent or spouse), you may be eligible to have your financial aid offer reevaluated. You can request a Family Contribution Appeal to have Financial Aid review your current household income to determine if you qualify for an adjustment. When submitting your appeal, documentation will be required (such as: death certificate, job separation notice, 2021 signed federal tax return). To submit the appeal, follow these steps: 1. Log into MyJSU 2. Click \"Financial Aid Requirements\" 3. You may be prompted to confirm your information (exactly as it appears on your FAFSA). 4. Once your information is confirmed, select the \"+-Request\" button, in the top, right corner. 5. Select \"Family Contribution Appeal\" 6. Type your statement explaining your situation and circumstances and electronically upload your supporting documentation. 7. Press the \"Submit\" button in the bottom, right corner once complete.
