Emergency Access Backup Plan: If the network goes down, note the time and contact your instructor . However, try to avoid such problems: Don\u2019t wait until the last minute to start your online assignments. Netiquette Expectations: According to The Core Rules of Netiquette by Virginia Shea, Netiquette (known as \"Internet etiquette\") is a catch-all term for the conventions of politeness and respect recognized in live chats, discussions, and emails. In online learning, Netiquette includes a set of guidelines that everyone should follow to promote appropriate online communication. Here are a few guidelines to follow when posting in online chats, discussions, and emails: Maintain a positive tone: When communicating online, we often forget that we are communicating with other human beings because we only see a computer screen. You do not see facial expressions, body language, or hear the tone of voice when you read messages. It's easy to misinterpret your correspondent's meaning, so always stop and think about your response before hitting submit. Always ask yourself, \"Would I say that to a person\u2019s face?\" Use appropriate grammar and structure: In other words, avoid using \"R U\" instead of \"are you.\" There are some students in class that may not understand this type of communication and it does not enhance anyone\u2019s writing or vocabulary skills. Emoticons are fine as long as they are appropriate. A smile :) is welcome, anything offensive is not. Never use all CAPS: In online communication, caps are known as shouting, so refrain from using them. Avoid personal attacks and flames: Do not respond to personal attacks or flames when responding online. If you believe that you are being attacked, please email your instructor. Avoid Offensive language: Cursing, racial slurs, and other types of language that would not be appropriate in a face-to-face class are also inappropriate online. Be respectful: Always be polite and respectful in your discussions. Discussions are constructed so that they will allow you to think critically and offer theory plus opinion. There will be differences in opinions. There will be many viewpoints. Remember: Students taking online courses come from different parts of the country or even other countries. Cultural differences allow us to appreciate different perspectives.
