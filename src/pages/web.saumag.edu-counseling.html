The counselor can assist you in clarifying goals and finding solutions to problems through careful listening, guided self-exploration, suggesting new perspectives for consideration, and providing new information. Counseling is not telling you what to do, how to feel, or who to be. Your initial interview with a counselor will help you identify which resources may best benefit you.
