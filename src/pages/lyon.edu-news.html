Wheeler, a junior double-majoring in political science and psychology with a pre-law concentration, is participating in an internship with the City Attorney for her hometown, Cabot, Ark. Wheeler learned about the internship this semester, and with a little help, made the right moves to get a foot in the door for the summer. \u201CI got the internship with the help of my dad. He is a department head for the city,\u201D Wheeler said. \u201CSo, when I was looking for an internship, I asked him if he knew any lawyers that would want an intern.\u201D She continued, \u201CHe got me in contact with the City Attorney and then I had a, more informal, meeting with him and the paralegal that also works for the city.\u201D Wheeler said that a majority of the work she will be doing includes filling out and filing paperwork, however, she has also been given an enticing opportunity for any pre-law student: the chance to attend court. \u201CMy first day on the internship was actually a court day, which is by far the most chaotic part of the internship.\u201D Wheeler said she wasn\u2019t as nervous or as on-edge as she would have been without the previous knowledge she had gained throughout her classes at Lyon. \u201CI had previously taken Intro to Legal Studies. In that class, we did a mock trial in a courthouse in Batesville,\u201D Wheeler said. \u201CSo, having that experience of being in a courthouse and going through the motions of reading cases and such really helped get me familiarized and comfortable with the environment.\u201D Classrooms and mock trials can only take students so far, which is why Wheeler is ready for court to be in session. \u201CI am mostly excited about getting to experience what being an attorney looks like, '' Wheeler said. \u201CI am planning on going to law school after Lyon, so I think that being able to experience the day-to-day atmosphere of a profession like this will be very valuable!\u201D Wheeler expressed how important she felt it is to take away some basic skills and knowledge in the legal field before fully dedicating the next several years of her life pursuing a career in law. \u201CI am very grateful for the opportunity to be able to have an internship for a career that I could see myself doing. Moreso, I am grateful for the opportunity to see if the legal field is something that I actually want to do. I think this is a good time to confirm what I want to do in the future.\u201D Wheeler hopes to utilize the knowledge she learns this summer to aid her in the next five years as she pursues a Juris Doctor degree. at Tuesday, May 31, 2022 internship Wednesday, May 25, 2022 Jonathan Thompson named Lyon College\u2019s newest Board of Trustees member Jonathan Thompson, \u201802, was recently appointed as a new member of Lyon College\u2019s Board of Trustees. Thompson made the move up from the Board of Visitors, which he was elected to in October 2021, to make a long-lasting impact on the Lyon College community at large. \u201CI want to contribute to the building up of Lyon College\u2019s reputation as a leader in the Liberal Arts of the future,\u201D Thompson said. \u201CI believe that we are in times now where the value of the liberal arts education and the philosophy of developing the whole person \u2013 not just the scholastic component\u2013 needs to be re-asserted and demonstrated in new fields of play.\u201D With Lyon College\u2019s Sesquicentennial unfolding this year, Thompson knows that now is the time to begin solidifying the College\u2019s position in higher education. \u201CLyon has the depth of talent and credentials necessary to be a leader in this charge, and, in doing so, embark on creating the next 150 years of educational legacy for thousands and thousands of students who will contribute to society long after many of us are gone.\u201D In addition to being a previous member of Lyon College\u2019s Board of Visitors, Thompson has traveled abroad with a Rotary International fellowship and worked across the U.S. alongside various name-brand companies. Currently he acts as the CEO of Illinois-headquartered business Nielsen-Massey Vanillas, a family-owned vanilla and flavor extract company. Coming equipped with several years of experience and knowledge, it can be easy to forget that Thompson started his journey as just another student here at Lyon College. \u201CI was a student-athlete, involved in various campus groups and activities, and ended up getting a triple major and a minor\u2026 so it was a busy four years,\u201D said Thompson, laughing, \u201Cbut I know I wouldn\u2019t have worked so hard nor accomplished so much if not for the amazing caliber of all the people around me: students, faculty and staff.\u201D He continued, \u201COne of the best things about Lyon was the strong investment by the faculty and staff in the development and success of students.\u201D Thompson noted that it wasn\u2019t just the people that were amazing, but also the welcoming and encouraging environment that Lyon College cultivated. \u201CI remember a vibrant campus culture that encouraged students to get involved & seek out new experiences, which made trying out new things very accessible,\u201D Thompson said. Having that first-hand experience with the community here, Thompson feels confident that he can make a positive impact at Lyon College. He continued, \u201CBeing an alum brings with it an understanding of the rich legacy, educational philosophy and \u2018ground-level\u2019 experience of Lyon, along with a vested passion in its continued success into the future.\u201D But something like this can\u2019t be accomplished by just a single person, so Thompson wants the community to know that his door is open. \u201CI would love to hear from people. Whether it is just a quick catch up or if someone wants to share an idea to help or get involved with Lyon, I invite anyone to please reach out!\u201D at Wednesday, May 25, 2022 Lyon alumni Board of Trustees Friday, May 20, 2022 Wijetunge wins 2022 Williamson Prize Associate Professor of Mathematics Dr. Tharanga Wijetunge won the 2022 Lamar Williamson Prize for Excellence in Teaching. The Williamson Prize is awarded annually to a Lyon faculty member whose accomplishments as a teacher and a scholar, personal character and service to church and community make him or her deserving of such an honor. Nominations are solicited from faculty and students, and a Williamson Prize Selection Committee recommends a recipient to the Board of Trustees for its approval at its spring meeting. Wijetunge will receive the Williamson Silver Cup and a personal stipend of $2,500. He will also have the honor of giving the Williamson Prize lecture next spring. Some of Wijetunge\u2019s colleagues describe him as \u201Ca perfect model of a teacher-scholar,\u201D \u201Ca model citizen who embodies Lyon\u2019s commitment to impacting lives,\u201D and \u201Can exemplary educator and mentor.\u201D \u201CI am humbly happy to be recognized as the recipient of the Williamson Prize Award in the 150th year of Lyon College, which is very special,\u201D said Wijetunge. He continued, \u201CIt is a great feeling to join a distinguished group of faculty at Lyon, especially because your own colleagues evaluated and recognized your accomplishments.\u201D Wijetunge earned his B.S. in Finance, Business and Computational Mathematics Special Degree, from the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka: and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Central Michigan University. Over the last nine years, Wijetunge has served on numerous committees, both standing and ad hoc, including the Assessment Committee and the Athletic Committee, and Faculty Athletic Representative, to name a few. Wijetunge inspires his students to be independent problem solvers and develop confidence in mathematics. He is often praised for his positive demeanor, impactful teachings, and his patience, which allows students to conduct their studies in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Wijetunge also has strong ties to the community, both in the surrounding Batesville area and as far away as the Tennessee Buddhist Vihara over 120 miles away in Memphis, Tennessee, that Wijetunge and his wife, Dr. Irosha Nawarathne, frequent. Wijetunge has on several occasions, according to colleagues and students alike, invited members of the Lyon and Batesville community to accompany them to the temple, highlighting the inclusivity and generosity that they possess. \u201CI would like to thank all my colleagues and students for nominating me this year,\u201D said Wijetunge. \u201CThank you Lyon College and the Williamson family for your continuous support.\u201D at Friday, May 20, 2022 faculty Williamson Prize commencement Saturday, May 14, 2022 Lyon College confers 145 degrees to 2022 graduating class Keynote speaker Dr. Brooks Blevins, \u201892, Noel Boyd Professor of Ozarks Studies in the history department at Missouri State University, used the life stories of three Lyon alumni to illustrate the value of perseverance, patience and pragmatism: detailing the turbulence that Lyon College has faced, yet highlighting what it means to survive. \u201CYou should not be here. I should not be here. WE should not be here. This college should not be here, and the fact that we are here today, in the 150th year of the life of Lyon College, defies logic,\u201D said Blevins. He continued,\u201DLyon College is a survivor and a thriver, and I would like to think we, as the people of Lyon, represent the tenacity, the doggedness, the plain ol\u2019 cussed grit poured into the foundations of this place. I am convinced that we imbibe the very marrow of this school and its history, that we pack it in our suitcases when we say goodbye to Spragins and the apartments and Wilson and Rogers and head off into the world.\u201D Senior Class President Olivia Echols shared reflections from the senior class, asking students to ponder the question, \u201CWhat is the best investment you can make?\u201D Quoting Warren Buffet, Echols succinctly illustrated what it truly means to strive for one\u2019s own excellence. \u201CThe best investment you can make is an investment in yourself. If you invest in yourself, no one can take it away from you,\u201D said Echols. Perry Wilson, chairman of the Lyon College Board of Trustees, announced Associate Professor of Mathematics Dr. Tharanga Wijetunge as the recipient of the Lamar Williamson Prize for Faculty Excellence.
