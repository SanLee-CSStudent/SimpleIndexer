The final step in good pond construction, and one of the most important, is to establish good vegetative cover over all exposed areas around the pond (figure 17). Too often, pond owners forget this critical step and quickly discover that the pond dam and banks are suffering from severe erosion and siltation. Ideally, topsoil should be set aside during the initial site preparation for construction. Following construction, the stockpiled topsoil should be spread, limed (if needed), and fertilized. The prepared soil can then be seeded, sprigged, or sodded with the appropriate grasses and sod-forming legumes. Depending on the season following construction, a cool- season groundcover can be planted in the fall, followed by overseeding in the spring with warm-season varieties. Check with your county Extension office for best ground covers and planting dates for your area. Figure 17. Seed new pond embankments to establish vegetative cover and reduce erosion.
