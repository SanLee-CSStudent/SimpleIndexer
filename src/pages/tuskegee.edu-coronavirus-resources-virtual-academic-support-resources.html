Online Academic Tutorial Services Academic tutorial services from the REACH Center will continue for the Spring 2020 term through the usage of Blackboard Collaborate Ultra. Blackboard Collaborate Ultra is a tool associated with the Tuskegee University Blackboard platform that provides real-time video conferencing so students and tutors\/coaches can add files, share applications, and use a virtual whiteboard to interact. It opens right in students\u2019 and tutor\u2019s\/coach\u2019s browsers, so there is no need to install any software to join a session. The REACH Center already has a course shell in Blackboard for use in tutoring sessions and academic skills and academic coaching sessions. It is an easy and practical approach to continuing to provide services to students in need of tutoring and one-on-one sessions with an academic coach to maneuver through the online process. To access the platform and schedule a session: Step 1: Log into EAB\/Navigate to schedule an appointment with a tutor or academic coach. Step 2: Await a confirmation email from the tutor\/coach. The confirmation will have a link attached for you to enter the session. Step 3: Once you enter the session, the session will be recording through Blackboard.
