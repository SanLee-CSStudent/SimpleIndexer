Additionally, temperature will be taken when arriving for a scheduled appointment. At this time wearing a mask is indicated for our health related setting. CDC guidelines suggest that masks be worn indoors for the unvaccinated and\/or everyone in \"hot spots\". Counseling sessions are conducted person-to-person and in relatively close proximity. Consideration is given for the health and well being of the student and counselor. Individual counselors will have the discretion to evaluate and adjust guidelines in the case of fully vaccinated or in situations that merit other considerations.
