Contact One Stop For All Other Non-Academic Needs Financial\/Accounting\/Scholarships Parking Housing Dining\/Meal Plan FAQ Why is my major listed as undeclared? Students who are admitted to UAB without a specific major interested are listed as \"undeclared.\" However, do not worry! We will work with you to make sure that you take classes that count for a wide variety of majors, and we will assist you in exploring majors that may be a good fit. Sometimes, students may be pursuing admission to specific programs (such as nursing, biomedical sciences, healthcare management, or engineering), but they haven't quite met the program's academic requirements. When this happens, the student will be listed as undeclared with an interest in a certain program. Although they are still technically \"undeclared,\" we work with students to help them meet the eligibility requirements for their program of interest until they are eligible to declare their major. Read more about changing majors by visiting the UAB Admissions Orientation FAQ. What is the importance of taking a First-Year Experience (FYE) course, such as UASC 101? First-Year Experience courses offer students the opportunity to learn about UAB and the resources we have to offer, which aids in a smooth transition to college. UASC 101 is specifically designed for undeclared students and aims to help them explore major and career interests that may be a good fit. Furthermore, First-Year Experience is a graduation requirement for all UAB undergraduate students. First-time freshmen and transfer students with fewer than 24 credit hours of college coursework are required to take a firstyear experience course before graduating. When should I contact my academic advisor? Your academic advisor will reach out to you approximately one week prior to orientation. If you have questions before then, please reach out to the Orientation office (This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. ) or the Admissions office (This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. ). Once you have received an email from your advisor or spoken to them at orientation, you should plan to meet with your advisor once a semester to discuss courses for the upcoming term, as well as your academic progress and goals. Your advisor will also reach out periodically with updates, announcements, and reminders. I transferred to UAB from another university. How can I know what credits I have already earned? Make sure to request your official transcripts be sent to UAB from the institution you transferred from. If you attended multiple colleges prior to UAB, you will need to request transcripts from all schools you attended. To see how your classes will transfer to UAB, you can consult the transfer credit equivalency database. Who can I contact for general questions before the first day of classes? Contact One Stop Student Services. They can answer general questions or direct you to the correct office for more complicated questions. Parent FAQ Where can we go for questions regarding high school\/dual enrollment transcripts, paying a student bill, and other financial questions? Please contact One Stop Student Services for these questions. Who should we contact regarding immunization holds and student health insurance? Please contact Student Health for these questions. Is there a way for me to see my student's academic information? Per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the information of students attending a post-secondary institution is private and cannot be released without the student's expressed permission. However, we understand the desire of parents to be involved in their child's academic success and have channels in place for students to release information to parents if they so desire. Students can authorize third parties to login to a parent\/guest portal. Students may also choose to sign a grade release form. However, please be aware that sensitive information cannot be released without the student's permission.
