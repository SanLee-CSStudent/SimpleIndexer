Clinical experiences are provided at area hospitals and healthcare agencies in adult health, maternal health, child health, orthopedics, geriatrics, psychiatric and other areas of nursing practice. Graduates of this program are eligible to apply to take the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN) and enter the workforce. Employment opportunities are vast and can occur in a variety of settings including hospitals, medical offices, urgent care centers, home healthcare, industry, schools, and long term care facilities. Our Mission Nursing Mission Statement The mission of the nursing programs of the Alabama Community College System is to prepare graduates to practice safe, competent, patient-centered care in an increasingly complex and rapidly changing health care system. We seek to provide full and equal access to opportunities for educational success to meet the community needs. Nursing Philosophy We believe that nursing is a dynamic profession, blending science with the use of evidence based practice and clinical reasoning and the art of caring and compassion to provide quality, patient-centered cared. We believe learning is an interactive process in which faculty and students share responsibility to meet program outcomes. We believe in using educational methods that are current and supportive of students in the teaching and learning environment, with the presentation of information from simple to complex. Nursing is guided by standards of practice and standards of professional performance. Standards reflect the values and priorities of the nursing profession. Therefore, we have integrated competencies from the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) and National League for Nursing (NLN) into our philosophy as part of our core values. Competencies NLN competencies for nursing are central to the conceptual framework. The related QSEN competencies for graduate nurses define the knowledge, skills and attitudes that the graduate nurse should possess to continuously improve the quality and safety of the healthcare systems within which they work. (QSEN) Human Flourishing - Advocate for patients and families in ways that promote their self-determination, integrity, and ongoing growth as human beings. (NLN def) Patient-Centered Care - Recognize the patient or designee as the source of control and full partner in providing compassionate and coordinated care based on respect for patient\u2019s preferences, values, and needs. (QSEN def) Nursing Judgment - Make judgments in practice, substantiated with evidence, that integrate nursing science in the provision of safe, quality care and that promote the health of patient within the family and community context. (NLN def) Safety - Minimizes risk of harm to patients and providers through both system effectiveness and individual performance. (QSEN def) Informatics - Use information and technology to communicate, manage knowledge, mitigate error, and support decision making. (QSEN def) Professional Identity - Implement one\u2019s role as a nurse in ways that reflect integrity, responsibility, ethical practices, and an evolving identity as a nurse committed to evidence-based practice, caring, advocacy, and safe, quality care for diverse patients within a family and community context. (NLN def) Teamwork and Collaboration - Function effectively within nursing and inter-professional teams, fostering open communication, mutual respect, and shared decision-making to achieve quality patient care. (QSEN def) Spirit of Inquiry - Examine the evidence that underlies clinical nursing practice to challenge the status quo, questions underlying assumptions, and offer new insights to improve the quality of care for patients, families, and communities. (NLN def) Evidence-based Practice - Integrate best current evidence with clinical expertise and patient\/family preferences and values for delivery of optimal health care. (QSEN def) Quality Improvement - Use data to monitor the outcomes of care processes and use improvement methods to design and test changes to continuously improve the quality and safety of health care systems. (QSEN def) The Program Program Goals Upon successful completion of the Associate Degree Nursing program, the graduate will be able to: Manage quality, safe, evidence-based, skilled, and patient-centered care utilizing the nursing process. Practice professional nursing behaviors incorporating personal responsibility and accountability for continued competence. Communicate professionally and effectively with individuals, significant support person(s), and members of the interdisciplinary healthcare team.

Participate in collaborative relationships with patients, families, and members of the interdisciplinary team to provide and improve patient care.
