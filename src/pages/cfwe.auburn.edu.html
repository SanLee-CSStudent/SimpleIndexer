As an intern, Lizzie is participating in a sea turtle research project where she is applying the skills she gained in the classroom and as an undergraduate research assistant at CFWE to her hands-on field work on the island. \u201CThe most exciting part about working on Cumberland Island would have to be that every single day on the island is different.

Thank you for visiting our website in observance of this important anniversary. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy learning about the history of Auburn\u2019s forestry and wildlife sciences programs within the interactive timeline and photo archive of the School\u2019s significant milestones and achievements. As you\u2019ll discover, forestry first became a stand-alone program in what was then known as the School of Agriculture in 1946. Since that time, Auburn has produced thousands of well-qualified graduates, provided citizens with science-based solutions to improve their quality of life and developed solutions to some of society\u2019s most complex natural resource challenges. In honor of this occasion, the School has published Arthur L. Slotkin\u2019s 75 Years of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences at Auburn University. Through personal interviews and in-depth research, Mr. Slotkin has created a detailed chronology that will take readers on a journey through time to discover how Auburn\u2019s forestry and wildlife programs evolved to become the present-day School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences. The School will commemorate its 75th anniversary from March 2021 through 2022. Throughout the year, we will invite our faculty, students, alumni, and friends to join us in celebrating the School\u2019s rich history of teaching, research, and extension through a series of virtual and in-person *events, including: 7 for 75 Virtual Speaker Series: Accomplished alumni and industry leaders representing our diverse programs will discuss a wide range of topics from land management to current and future technology to stakeholder engagement. Dean\u2019s Q & A and Alumni Breakout Sessions: Deans past and present will share their personal stories of the major milestones that occurred during their tenure. As part of these virtual roundtable discussions, we will host breakout sessions for alumni to socialize and reminisce about their time at Auburn. 75th Anniversary Events: Faculty, staff, and students will celebrate the anniversary with alumni and friends during the School\u2019s annual events, including the student awards banquet, graduate research symposium, and alumni homecoming barbeque. 75th Anniversary Gala: The anniversary celebrations will conclude with a signature gala in the spring of 2022 at the Gogue Performing Arts Center. To feature a distinguished keynote speaker, guests will also enjoy dinner, musical entertainment, a complimentary book signing with Arthur Slotkin, and a short documentary of the 75-year history of forestry and wildlife sciences at Auburn University. In addition to this exciting calendar of events, we invite our alumni to share their Auburn experience by submitting stories, photos, and other memorabilia to our website that will be shared online with fellow alumni during the anniversary celebration year. On behalf of the faculty and staff, we look forward to commemorating this milestone anniversary with you in honor of 75 years of forestry and wildlife Sciences at Auburn University! War Eagle!
