Frequently Asked Questions: Will tutoring really help me pass my class(es)? Yes! NPC students who attend tutoring sessions regularly and frequently, achieve up to 20-percent more A, B, or C grades than the average student. Am I limited to one tutoring session or a certain number of tutoring hours? No. Students may attend as many tutoring labs as they need. Tutoring labs do not have a restriction of how many hours of tutoring you can receive per semester. Students do not need permission to attend tutoring labs and may attend on a walk-in basis. In some extenuating situations, students may request tutoring by appointment. These sessions are limited and must be scheduled through the tutoring coordinator. How do I prepare for a tutoring session? Bring your textbook, class notes, past quizzes or assignments if needed, course syllabus, current homework or workbook problems that you are having difficulty completing. Attempt as much of the work as you are able BEFORE the session and write down your questions so you have them ready. Do NOT expect the tutor to work on homework assignments or explain class lectures. Expect the tutor to help with understanding concepts, learning material and with study techniques to improve learning and test scores. How can I make my tutoring session successful? Be prompt to the session. Come prepared, be sure you have everything you need with you. Understand the tutor may be working with several students simultaneously. Know that tutoring sessions may be conducted over NPC's video system so the tutor may not be in the room with you. Turn off your cell phone so that phone calls or texts do not disrupt the session. Be courteous and respectful to everyone in the room. Keep conversations focused on course-related topics. Does it really matter how regularly I go to tutoring sessions? Yes. Students who study with a tutor (and\/or a study group in a tutoring lab) for one hour, two or more times each week, will gain a better understanding of the concepts and achieve long-term learning. Bursts of studying, such as \"cramming\" or receiving tutoring for a solid 3-4 hours in one sitting is a common misconception on how to learn or to pass tests. After a period of time the mind gets tired, it is harder to stay focused on the subject matter and a person may begin to feel frustrated or overwhelmed by too much information. A person who tries to study all course material at one time does not clearly remember the material studied after the mind started to get tired. The more tired the mind, the less clearly material is remembered. Studying for short periods that are spread out over the week, helps keep the content manageable and the mind focused and alert.
