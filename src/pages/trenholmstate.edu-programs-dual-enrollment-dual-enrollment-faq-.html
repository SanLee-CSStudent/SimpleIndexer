Besides, high school guidance counselors can request a copy of students\u2019 grades each semester. Are my Dual Enrollment grades listed on my high school and college transcripts? Grades earned in Dual Enrollment courses are listed on the student\u2019s high school transcript and count toward high school graduation requirements. The grades are also listed on the students' TSCC transcript once they graduate from high school or earn a GED. These grades are permanent college grades and become a part of the student\u2019s permanent college transcript. Will Dual Enrollment courses transfer to other colleges and universities? Academic transfer courses will transfer to most four-year colleges and universities in Alabama. The Statewide Transfer Articulation System (STARS) provides information on courses that transfer from TSCC to Alabama\u2019s public four-year institutions. For information on STARS and transfer credit in Alabama, students should go to www.stars.troy.edu. Students who plan to attend a college or university out of state should contact the institution for specific transfer information. Career technical courses are not designed for transfer.

These courses can lead to an Associate in Applied Science degree or certificate and help with early employment opportunities in today\u2019s highly skilled workforce. How much do Dual Enrollment courses cost? Dual Enrollment students pay the same tuition rate as all TSCC students. Tuition and fees are based on the number of credit hours.
