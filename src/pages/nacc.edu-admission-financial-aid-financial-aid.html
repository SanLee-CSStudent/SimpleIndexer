Any prospective or enrolled student may apply for financial aid. A financial need is established when it is determined that the resources of the family (expected family contribution, the primary source of student finances) do not meet the cost of attending a particular college. To be considered for most types of financial assistance, you must first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year before the Fall Semester. Northeast Alabama Community College encourages students to apply as soon as possible after October 1 for the upcoming academic year, with July 15 as the priority deadline.(The academic year is fall-spring-summer, in that order.) Lifetime Eligibility Students have a lifetime eligibility limit of 12 full time semesters or equivalent to receive a Pell Grant. This lifetime eligibility limit applies no matter when a student received the first Pell award. Summer Term Pell Grants are available for all three terms in the academic year 2021-2022. If you are starting college in the summer, you must apply for summer Pell in the current year (2021-2022) in addition to applying for fall\/spring Pell for the coming year (2022-2023). Changed need during the year If your financial needs change during the academic year after you apply, you may submit your new information for consideration; contact the Financial Aid Office to see how. FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS FEDERAL PELL GRANT The Pell Grant is an entitlement program which does not have to be repaid.

FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GRANT (FSEOG) The Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant may range from $100 to $1200 per academic year and does not have to be repaid. It is based on the lowed Expected Family Contribution (EFC).
