We believe that education is the most important and sustainable resource for individual empowerment, community advancement, and poverty alleviation. Your gift is a lasting legacy for our community\u2019s future. We are all stakeholders in that legacy. Start a scholarship or consider contributing to an existing fund today. AWC Foundation Scholarship Fund By donating to the AWC Foundation Scholarship Fund, you are joining a community of givers who believe that college changes lives. Making scholarship opportunities available to those who may not meet the specific requirements of other scholarships but still need help with tuition and books is a priority for the AWC Foundation Board of Directors. Building the AWC Foundation Scholarship Fund ensures a perpetuating revenue source that will continue to fund scholarships that are not criteria dependent but critically important. AWC Foundation Emergency Grant Program The AWCF Emergency Grant Program is a one-time award given to students who are experiencing a temporary financial crisis and are at risk of dropping out of college. This fund was created to help students stay in college and meet their educational goals, securing a better financial future for themselves and their families. Please consider a donation to the Emergency Grant Program so that we may continue to meet these urgent needs of our students. Give Online Ways to Give Matching Gifts Alumni and friends can double their gift to the AWC Foundation if their employer is a matching-gifts company. A matching gift is a charitable donation by a corporation that matches an employee\u2019s donation to an eligible nonprofit organization, most often dollar for dollar. Memorial and Honorary Gifts A thoughtful way of remembering someone special and creating a living legacy is by making a gift to the Foundation in honor, or in memory, of an individual. Memorial gifts can include a scholarship in the name of the person, or a room or building dedication. Gifts of Stocks and Securities A gift of stock or securities (stock, bonds, and mutual funds) typically involves publicly traded shares, such as those traded on the major exchanges or over the counter, as well as most mutual funds. Your gift of securities can provide you with significant tax and financial benefits, such as bypassing capital gains taxes and providing a valuable income tax deduction. Gifts of Real Property A direct donation of a home or property to the AWC Foundation will allow donors to take a full, fair-market-value tax deduction while eliminating the substantial capital gains tax they would incur if they sold the property first and donated the proceeds. Trusts, Wills and Bequests You can include the AWC Foundation in your will or trust, including living trusts and charitable remainder trusts. We recommend these provisions be discussed with your attorney and tax advisor. In order to assure that AWC Foundation will benefit, you may use one of the following statements: I give __% of my estate to the AWC Foundation. I give the remainder of my estate to the AWC Foundation. I give $__ to the AWC Foundation. I give my assets to my spouse if my spouse survives me. If he\/she predeceases me, I give my assets to the AWC Foundation. Payroll Deductions AWC employees may make one-time and continuing contributions to the Foundation via payroll deduction during the Foundation\u2019s annual giving campaign.
