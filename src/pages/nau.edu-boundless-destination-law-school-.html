She\u2019s preparing to attend law school at the University of Arizona\u2019s James E. Rogers College of Law with a generous scholarship. Before starting college, Barrera competed as a powerlifter. She was lifting more than double her body weight. Each time, Barrera had to answer a question: \u201CCan I lift this weight?\u201D Beyond her physical strength, Barrera relied on her preparation and mental resolve. The same focus and determination that helped her succeed at powerlifting carried Barrera through NAU and on to law school. Lost Barrera didn\u2019t plan on going to college in Arizona. Originally from the United Kingdom, she is now a US resident. However, when she first traveled to the Southwest, she just wanted to see the sights and then head off to a job in New Zealand. But Barrera met a man in Tucson, fell in love, and ended up getting married. It was an abusive relationship. Barrera credits the support network she found in Tucson for helping her survive domestic violence. \u201CAll these people held me up when I didn\u2019t believe in myself, didn\u2019t believe I was worth it,\u201D she says. \u201CI was completely candid about what he did, but I was still convinced that it was my fault.\u201D She shares this part of her story because it changed her trajectory, and because she wants to empower other women. \u201CWhat happened to me, in my experiences of domestic violence, is a huge motivating factor of what led me to law school,\u201D Barrera says. \u201CDomestic violence is not talked about enough. I think it\u2019s something that a lot of women experience and maybe don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re experiencing.\u201D After her marriage ended and she went through a domestic violence trial, Barrera had to find out who she was again. \u201CI was very academically driven and motivated, and I had nothing but the world in front of me, and then it just all came crashing down within a matter of eight or nine months,\u201D she says. \u201CI completely lost who I was.\u201D With the help of several non-profit domestic abuse agencies and a strong social network, Barrera slowly began to regain her sense of self. This was when she became a powerlifter. To Samantha, lifting helped her start taking care of herself after experiencing domestic violence. Charting a new path Barrera remarried and became a mother to two children. After the birth of her second child, she started to think about what she wanted to do next. \u201CI thought, \u2018You\u2019re going to blink and you\u2019re going to be 30 and then 40, then 50,\u2019\u201D Barrera says. \u201CYou want your children to follow their ambitions and pursue their absolute best selves, but you yourself haven\u2019t done that.\u201D Barrera asked herself what she would want to do if nothing was holding her back. Her answer: \u201CI\u2019d be a lawyer.\u201D Her husband and friends supported her goal, but as a stay-at-home mother of two young children, the challenge was finding the most time- and cost-effective path to law school. She started with an online associate degree in liberal arts at Pima Community College (PCC), and heard about NAU\u2019s online Personalized Learning (PL) program through her PCC advisor. \u201CPersonalized Learning has been very valuable for me because it was extremely cost effective and allowed me to streamline my courses,\u201D she says. \u201CI could accelerate every class and work as fast as I wanted.\u201D Jayme Davis, an Assistant Clinical Professor in the PL program, got to know Barrera by serving as her mentor. \u201CShe is a great example for why we have the program,\u201D Davis says. \u201CWe want to make education accessible for those who don\u2019t have the luxury of being on campus, those who might have to get up in the middle of the night to type in an essay after the kids are asleep. That\u2019s why we have the program.\u201D All told, it took Barrera 15 months to complete her associate and bachelor\u2019s degrees, study for the GRE, and be accepted to law school. She used the flexibility of the PL program to her full advantage to work through the courses at her fast pace. While at school Barrera flourished. At PCC she presented \u201CThe Sexualization of Women Across Social Media and its Impact on Women\u201D at an undergraduate research symposium, published a poem called \u201CThe Book of Life\u201D in the literary magazine SandScript, and was awarded the PCC Library Research Award for two consecutive years for her research on the death penalty. At NAU she won the Samuel Larue Finley humor writing contest for her essay, \u201CA Day in the Life.\u201D These achievements took focus, planning, and long nights. Even now, she reads law books while her children are sleeping to get a head start on her upcoming coursework. Barrera says earning her degree while raising two kids was incredibly hard, but enjoyable at the same time. \u201CI really enjoy writing, so that was the beauty of it because the Liberal Arts degree is very writing intensive,\u201D she says. \u201CI love writing and thinking critically and analytically.\u201D Reaching the destination Barrera\u2019s goal is to be a criminal prosecutor. Remembering her experiences in the courtroom during her domestic abuse trial, she hopes to pay it forward. As she puts it: \u201CI just want to have the opportunity to contribute positively to the reformation of the criminal justice system here in America.\u201D Davis, her mentor at NAU, says Barrera is continuing to do some heavy lifting, both literally and figuratively. \u201CWhen Samantha was at her lowest point, she decided to get into powerlifting,\u201D Davis says. \u201CSamantha\u2019s situation could have gone south really quickly, and instead, she found a creative and clever way to adapt and turn it into a healthy piece of her personal evolution, growth, and development.\u201D For Barrera, everything from powerlifting to getting into law school is about commitment. \u201CGrowth is what happens when you apply yourself, and I guess that\u2019s the core of what I\u2019m proud of,\u201D she says. \u201CAnd I think that\u2019s all you can ask for yourself\u2014if you apply yourself, everything else falls into place.\u201D SHARE YOUR STORY What goals have you crushed?
