Learn how to make it happen now. Internal Event Requests The Office of Events Management oversees university event operations and logistics. We strive to create more efficient ways to use our scheduling resources to provide high-quality event support to the university and community. The Office of Events Management operates under Policy 1.02. Samford related events, whether it is a staff meeting or an after-hours study session, may be scheduled and requested through SPACES, our scheduling software. Building coordinators will approve or deny Samford-related event requests. All external groups, whether sponsored or not, must seek approval through the office of events management. Both sponsored and external events are required to submit a series of documents, including liability insurance, sponsorship verification form, and contract, prior to announcing any details for the event. These events may take place after 3 p.m., Monday-Friday, and 8 a.m.-10 p.m. on Saturdays, during the fall and spring terms. External events are subject to availability of rooms and resources, and current event protocols. Services University-wide Scheduling (SPACES) Tailgating Weddings Summer Programs Event Support Services Public Safety Parking & Transportation Technology Services External Event Requests During the academic year all campus facilities are for the primary use and enjoyment of Samford University students, faculty, administration and staff. Scheduling of space during the academic year must be initiated by an academic department, administrative office or recognized student organization. Outside of these groups, we are happy to welcome external guests on to campus, Monday-Friday, after 3 p.m., and Saturdays, 8 a.m.-10 p.m., during the academic year. An important part of the rental process is to ensure that there is no conflict with the needs of the university. For instance, at the Office of Events Management, requests for rentals are confirmed only after academic classroom and administrative space has been allocated for the semester. When a space is confirmed as available for rental, the following procedures apply: A standard Samford University rental agreement will be signed by the organization or agency that wishes to rent the space. The terms of the contract are very specific concerning the use of the facility and will be strictly enforced by the office of Events Management. Additional fees may apply if there is a breach of contract. Rental fees will be charged based on the size and complexity of the event and may not be solely based on space availability. Auxiliary support services and university resources will be considered before a contracted event is confirmed. The resources include but are not limited to: parking, catering, university employee schedules, and fixed asset upgrades or repairs. Additional fees may be required based on complexity of requested space or service. As noted in the contract, the Outside Group is prohibited from using the university name, logo or trademarks, in any form of communication, including but not limited to websites, social media and brochures, without the prior written consent of the Executive Director of University Communication. The Outside Group may not promote the event in a manner that suggests endorsement, partnership or co-branding with the university without the prior written consent of the Executive Director of University Communication. It is important to keep in mind that the primary purpose of all Samford facilities is to directly support the academic and administrative mission of the university. Sponsorship or rentals involving outside parties will only be accommodated based on space and resource availability. When an outside organization requests use of campus facilities, the event is considered an external event, and an appropriate fee is charged. The university will recover university expenses (utilities, additional cleaning costs, personnel overtime, etc.) incurred in connection with an external event.
