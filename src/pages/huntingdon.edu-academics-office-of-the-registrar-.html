Online courses may require the student to secure proctoring services (and cover associated fees for services) for specified assignments. Specifics regarding those requirements are available from the instructor. Posting of Graduation Huntingdon College currently offers students a bachelors degree. The degree requires three fundamental pieces related to hours earned and timing of completion: general degree requirements (120 hours, etc.), completion of the College\u2019s general education core, and the completion of courses toward an officially declared major. Beginning Fall 2015, any student who has satisfactorily complete these three pieces, along with the other specified graduation requirements per the student\u2019s catalog of matriculation, will have degree completion\/graduation automatically posted to his\/her record at the end of the applicable term. Students seeking a second major, but who have graduated per the above policy (completed general graduation requirements, general education\/core and one major) may still be eligible for financial aid, residency on campus and\/or athletic eligibility. All majors sought must be declared by the student officially with the Office of the Registrar prior to reaching Senior standing (90 earned credit hours). Students seeking a minor must declare the minor(s) prior to reaching Senior standing (90 earned credit hours). In rare cases, a student may be permitted to add a minor after this time, but only with confirmation from the Office of the Registrar that the student is missing 6 credit hours or fewer toward completion of the minor. Upon confirmation of a student\u2019s anticipated degree completion, which is sent by the Office of the Registrar, a student may not postpone his\/her term of completion in order to complete a minor or a second major, as neither a minor nor a second major is a requirement for a degree at Huntingdon College. Postponement of degree completion will be permitted only for students who have not satisfied all graduation requirements in relation to the general degree requirements, general education core requirements or for officially declared major requirements (assuming no major is completed).
