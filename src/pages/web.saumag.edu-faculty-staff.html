This year includes two SAU Holidays and 8 hours of mandatory annual leave. Classes will not meet on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The students and faculty will have the day off. A survey of the staff indicated that an overwhelming majority wished to continue observing Dr. King\u2019s birthday during the Christmas\/New Year\u2019s break; therefore, the University will remain open. Supervisors will make every effort to allow any staff member to take a day of annual leave if they prefer. Traditionally, there are events to honor Dr. King on campus that day.
