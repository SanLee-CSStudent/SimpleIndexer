Decisions are based on the fluid situation created by public health concerns and guidance provided by The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH), University Health Services (UHS) data, and state and local health officials. Effective Monday, February 21, SAU will rescind the current mandatory mask policy and mask usage will become optional throughout campus. This change is due to the sharp decline of COVID-19 infections in Columbia County and on the SAU campus. Signage will be updated as soon as possible to reflect this change. SAU strongly supports the right of students to continue to wear masks in the classroom and in other settings, if they so choose. SAU will continue to make surgical masks available in all classrooms and in other common areas where disposable masks are currently located. A limited number of KN95 masks are available to students who prefer them, and may be picked up Overstreet Hall information desk located on the first floor during regular business hours. SAU employees may have signs posted outside personal workspaces requesting mask usage in their work areas. Please be respectful of others by complying with these requests.
