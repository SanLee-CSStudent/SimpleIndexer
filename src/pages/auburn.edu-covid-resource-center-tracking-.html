Data from previous years can be found below. Previously, testing information was compiled weekly (Monday\u2013Sunday) when classes were in session and posted to the CRC website. The University will continue to monitor and collect data from self-reports and the Auburn University Medical Clinic and will update this website if necessary. Additionally, with vaccines now widely available this website will no longer provide data reflecting the number of vaccinations administered by the university. Self-Reported Positive Covid-19 Tests The university requires all current students and employees who test positive for COVID-19, regardless of testing location, to complete a confidential Self-Report Form. Self-reported data includes those reports submitted by students, faculty, staff and third-party contractors working on campus who have tested positive for COVID-19. The Self-Report Form is how an individual notifies Auburn University, through the COVID Resource Center, about their test result. Submission of the form enables the university to help reduce exposure among the campus community by providing necessary contact tracing and follow-up care. Note: Total positive cases include self-reported numbers from Auburn students, employees and contractors. Auburn University Medical Clinic numbers are not added to this number as they include cases that were self-reported and individuals that are not part of the Auburn campus community.

Patients are encouraged to self-report positive COVID-19 test results to the university, but not all patients are Auburn students, faculty or staff.
