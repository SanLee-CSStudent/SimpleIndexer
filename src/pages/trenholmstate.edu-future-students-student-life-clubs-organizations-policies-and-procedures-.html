At the appropriate time, a constitution containing the following must be presented. The name of the organization; a statement of purpose of the organization; the membership eligibility requirements; a list of chartering students; a list of officers by title and any special functions of the office; a statement of the terms of the officers, and the time and method of election; frequency of meetings; a statement of membership dues, including amount and frequency of payment and provision for disposition of any funds in the event of dissolution of the organization; provisions for club advisors and name of club advisors. Temporary Formation Temporary formation will be given to organizations upon completion of the above stated regulations. The organization will be permitted to function for not more than one semester pending official charter approval. Review and Approval Three typewritten copies of the proposed constitution must be submitted to the Dean of Students for suggestions, recommendations and approval. In the event that recognition is withheld, appeal may be made to the Dean of Students. The President of the College will make the final approval decision. During the time that the application for recognition is being considered, or an appeal is being made, a group may not sponsor speakers or activities in the name of the proposed organization. After receiving the approval of the Dean of Students, the constitution must be submitted to the Student Government Association\u2019s Executive Committee for approval. At the beginning of each semester, each organization must submit a current list of officers, advisors and active members to the Dean of Students. Any change or amendment affecting the nature or purpose of the organization as originally approved must also be approved by the Dean of Students. An up-to-date copy of the constitution must be on file in the Office of the Dean of Students. Club Advisors: Eligibility and Role All student organizations must have one qualified club advisor. When the membership exceeds fifty, organizations are urged to obtain an additional faculty advisor. Any faculty member with at least one year of teaching experience at Trenholm College or any non-teaching member of the College staff whose position is comparable to that of a full-time faculty member may, with the approval of the Dean of Students, Academic Dean and President of the College, serve as an advisor to a student organization. The Dean of Students must approve any change in the club advisors. The Dean of Students will make every attempt to rotate club advisors to allow all interested persons to serve in that capacity. Rotation of advisors will come at the end of each semester when possible. Persons with special talents needed for a particular club will be given preference. A faculty member who agrees to serve as a club advisor accepts responsibility for encouraging the organization in its purpose and activities, within the limits of college policy and the goals and objectives of the organization as set forth in the statement of purpose and in the constitution. Advisors are responsible for being familiar with and operating within the following: Policy and other college regulations pertaining to the student organizations and speakers; The constitution and purpose of the student organization that they are advising; The activities and the service projects of the organizations; Meetings will not be authorized or recognized unless attended by the advisor or a substitute duly approved by the Dean of Students.

All clubs and organizations must conform to the laws and policies of the State of Alabama, the State Board of Education, Trenholm State Community College and the Student Government Association (SGA). No club or organization shall interfere or support interference with the regular academic pursuit of any student. No club or organization shall cause or encourage non-attendance of classes or campus activities without prior consent of proper College officials.
