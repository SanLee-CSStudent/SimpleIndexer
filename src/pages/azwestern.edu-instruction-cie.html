The CIE was formed on the belief that individuals, departments, and institutions have an unlimited capacity for professional growth and development. Based on these beliefs the faculty, staff, and administration have committed to assuring the resources necessary to provide a comprehensive program that will meet the continually changing needs faculty face in our multicultural society. Goals Promote the professional development of faculty Encourage instructional improvement efforts of faculty Assist adjunct faculty Acquaint faculty with college resources and services Serve as a professional development resource for all interested in the teaching and learning process Promote and encourage scholarship in teaching Activities Professional Development seminars and discussions Faculty Professional Development Day (held spring semester) Facilitation of Faculty Professional Travel Facilitation of Faculty Appraisal program Writing Intensive Curriculum support English Symposium sponsorship Noon Discovery Series 2.0 (NDS2) Faculty Journeys Mentor-Mentee Program Faculty Recognition- Teacher of the Year (TOY) & NISOD Excellence New Full-time Faculty Orientation (NFO) New Adjunct Faculty Orientation (NAFO) Learning Services- Socials Mentor Program Travel Steps Mentor Program What is the AWC Mentor Program? The AWC Mentor Program is primarily designed to help new faculty adapt to the challenges of their new job at Arizona Western College. Who Participates in the Mentor Program? During the first semester, a new full-time faculty member is paired with an experienced faculty member who acts as a resource person to share information about the college, teaching, classroom management, or other subject matter as needed. In addition to new faculty, other faculty members may request a mentor for assistance with a new assignment such as teaching over the ITN. Who Are Mentors? Mentors are experienced faculty, both full-time and adjunct, who demonstrate a positive attitude about AWC, the College's mission, and their own life. They are skilled and proven instructors with exemplary communication skills. They are individuals who are willing to share information, display patience, diplomacy, and resourcefulness, and are willing to accept the responsibility of helping someone grow professionally. Full-time and adjunct faculty who have taught for a minimum of four semesters at AWC are eligible to be considered to be mentors. Every spring, the Director of the CTE asks Division Chairs (DC) and Program Directors (PD) to identify as potential mentors experienced full-time faculty, who have taught at AWC for at least four semesters. The DC or PD asks the full-time faculty if they would serve as a mentor for the following fall semester. If the faculty agrees, the DC or PD assigns the mentor to the new full-time faculty (= mentee). The mentor does not necessarily have to be in the same division as the mentee. Only faculty in non-supervisory roles can serve as mentors. How Does the Process Work? The mentor contacts the mentee during the first week of the semester to set up a planning meeting. Together a mutual plan is developed for the semester, including an exchange of classroom observations. The mentor\/mentee relationship is informal and reflects an attitude of colleagues helping each other. It is never a supervisory relationship. A critical part of the semester of mentoring is the classroom visit done by the mentee in the mentor's classroom and vice-versa. At the end of the semester, mentors of full-time faculty are awarded a small stipend for their efforts once they've submitted all the requisite paperwork to the CTE. Steps for CIE Professional Development Travel 1 First Faculty identifies conference, professional meeting, etc. and submits required documents to the Division Travel Committee.
