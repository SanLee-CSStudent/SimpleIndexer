Program Give UNCF Golf Select Page One of our choirs Dynamic Praise ministering Spiritual Life and Mission Blessings & Breakthroughs: Highlights of the October 2021 Board Meeting The Office of Spiritual Life at Oakwood University supports the educational mission of Oakwood University by championing the transformational ministry of Seventh-day Adventist education to the administration, faculty, staff, and students of Oakwood University. The commission of Jesus Christ in Matthew 28:18-20 and Revelation 14:6-12 compels Oakwood University to promote the wholistic development of our students, faculty, staff, and administrators, to prepare our campus personnel to lead lives of service in this world, and to prepare ourselves for service in the world to come. The Office of Spiritual Life therefore urges the entire University community to accept Jesus Christ as personal Savior, to unite with His end-time church, and to prepare ourselves and others for His soon return. Within and beyond the Oakwood University campus community, this witness will be accomplished through our collective preaching, teaching, serving, and equipping ministries. Oakwood participates in annual local, national and international mission trips where we seek to involve students, faculty and staff. We believe that through service character is developed and faith is strengthened. The following clips capture what we endeavor to do.

In this work they will find opportunity to speak the words of life. Thus they will sow the seeds of truth. Let young men show that they have resting on them a burden from the Lord. The only way for them to prove that they can stand firm in God, having on the whole armor, is by doing faithfully the work God has given them to do.\u2013Manuscript 75, 1900. {CM 32.1}\u201D LETC Scholarship Applications Resources Institutional Worship Approved Worships Spiritual Enrichment Request Form Order Number First Name * Position * Student Staff Faculty Last Name * Request * Baptism Bible Study Visit Prayer Request Email Address * Contact Us Office: (256) 726-7108 Fax: (256) 726-8414 @OUOSLM @OakwoodOslm @oakwoodoslm MAKE A GIFT Get Inspired.
