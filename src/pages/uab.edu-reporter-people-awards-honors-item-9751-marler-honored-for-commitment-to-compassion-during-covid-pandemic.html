AMANDA CHAMBERS By Brooke Carbo Malcolm Marler, D.Min., chaplain and senior director of UAB Pastoral Care, was honored in February with the UAB President\u2019s Award for Excellence in Shared Values. Marler was selected from among the 12 2021 UAB VIP Award honorees, whose work consistently exemplifies and embodies UAB\u2019s shared values of integrity, stewardship, collaboration, accountability, respect, excellence and achievement, and diversity and inclusion. In an online presentation, UAB President Ray Watts recognized Marler for his response \u201Cin the earliest and darkest days of the pandemic,\u201D when chaplains were separated from patients by a glass partition. \u201CReverend Marler would place his hands on the glass and say a quiet prayer ... to comfort and encourage our patients,\u201D Watts said. \u201CI don\u2019t know any image that conveys more strongly our shared values, our compassion and our character.\u201D Marler spent time in clinic to better understand what patients were experiencing and learned the safety measures that would enable him and his team of 30 chaplains to resume bedside visits. Marler\u2019s efforts allowed his team to be present at the bedside of patients who needed comfort and helped make it possible for all staff chaplains to be properly fitted for and trained with N95 masks and other personal protective equipment. He understood the importance of a face-to-face human connection, says Laura Kowalczyk, vice president for Supply Chain and Support Services. Malcolm Marler, D.Min.\u201CThis was a huge relief not only for our patients but also for their families and our staff who were bearing so much of the stress for all of the care \u2014 physical, emotional and spiritual,\u201D Kowalczyk said. Throughout the battle against COVID-19, Marler has been \u201Ca pillar of strength\u201D for UAB medical staff, said Vice President of Clinical Support Services Sarah Nafziger, M.D. When the pandemic first hit, she recalls his showing up to pray with those on the front lines and offer a calming word of encouragement. \u201CIt meant a lot to us in the command center in those early days when we were scared,\u201D Nafziger said. \u201CHe\u2019s been there every step of the way with us.\u201D The inaugural President\u2019s Award for Excellence in Shared Values was presented in January 2021 to 10 faculty and 10 staff members who were recognized for demonstrating UAB\u2019s Shared Values during the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic. The award was then incorporated into the UAB Values in Action Program, formerly the UAB Employee of the Month\/Year Program. Under the rebranded program, the President\u2019s Award for Excellence in Shared Values has replaced the former UAB Employee of the Year Award. Marler is the first UAB VIP Award recipient to receive the President\u2019s Award for Excellence in Shared Values under the UAB Values in Action Program.
