This platform allows you to post positions, request information sessions, register for events and schedule on-campus interviews. SIGN IN REGISTER HANDSHAKE HELP CENTER On-Campus Interviews On-campus interviewing (OCI) offers employers the opportunity to connect students to positions within their organization. Employers may choose from several different recruiting models that offer varying degrees of control over who you will interview during your visit to Arkansas Tech University. Pre-Select: The interviewer screens resumes and invites select applicants to interview. Pre-Select with Alternates: The interviewer screens resumes and invites select applicants to interview, and can also select alternates candidates who many sign-up for interviews in any pre-selected candidates decline the interview offer. Open: The interviewer does not screen applicant. Qualified candidates sign up for interviews on a first come, first serve basis without an invitation. Room Only: The interviewer is completely responsible for building the interview schedule, contacting candidates, and providing the final schedule to Norman Career Services staff upon arrival. We will hold the room on reservation for you. Changing or Canceling an Interviewing Schedule Please contact Kylia Stewart to make changes to your schedule. It is strongly recommended that all changes be made BEFORE deadlines in the schedule occur. If you need to cancel, please contact kstewart20@atu.edu during office hours (8:00AM CT - 4:45PM CT). Information Sessions During these sessions, employers make presentations on topics that include the organization's career opportunities, culture, and products or services. Norman Career Services and the Academic Departments will promote these sessions to the appropriate audience. Classroom Presentation Speaking to a class provides employers with the opportunity to make presentations to specific major groups. This provides exclusive assess to a sub-population of students. To request a class presentation please complete the Event Request Form and our Employer Relations Coordinator will be in contact with you.
