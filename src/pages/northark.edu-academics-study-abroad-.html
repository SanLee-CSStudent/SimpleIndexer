Expand your cultural knowledge and bring your friends and family along. The program is not just for students. All of Northark's short-term trips are open to the community as well. About Short-Term Study Abroad Contact the STSA Director Jackson Murray jmurray@northark.edu (870) 391-3295 Room: M154M, South Campus The Short-Term Study Abroad (STSA) program provides a short-term, faculty\/staff led immersion travel experience provided to the greater Northark community through the academics division. Every year, STSA travels to a different country for two weeks between the spring and summer semesters. These travel courses provide an in-depth immersion experience to understand the cultural, historical, artistic and religious contexts of the chosen host country. Pairing the travel course with an optional full-term, spring semester academic course allows participants to further broaden the experience, to focus on specific academic areas of interest, and gain college credit. The mission of North Arkansas College is to provide high quality, affordable, convenient opportunities for learning and community enrichment. The Short-Term Study Abroad program shares and directly supports that mission. This program provides students the opportunity to go beyond the classroom, to directly engage with diverse cultures, and transform their academic coursework into direct, interactive application. For community members, the program provides a unique continuing education and personal enrichment activity to broaden one's understanding of the world in which we live and today's globalized society.
