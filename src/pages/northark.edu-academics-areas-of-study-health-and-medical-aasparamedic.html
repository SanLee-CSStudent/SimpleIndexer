Faculty Contact Jacob Williams EMT\/Paramedic Program Director (870) 391-3125 jacob.williams@northark.edu Program Goals Recognize a medical emergency, assess the situation, and manage emergency care and extrication, if necessary. Establish rapport with the patient and his\/her significant others to alleviate their state of crisis. Assign priorities of emergency treatment and record and communicate data to the designated medical command authority. Coordinate efforts of agencies involved in the care and transportation of the patient. Initiate and continue emergency medical care under medical control, including the recognition of presenting medical conditions and initiation of appropriate non-invasive and invasive therapies. Exercise personal judgment in case of interruption in medical direction caused by communications failure or in cases of life threatening conditions using protocols specifically authorized in advance. Learning Outcomes Graduates of the Paramedic Program will distinguish the nature and seriousness of the medical condition and extent of traumatic injuries using anatomy and physiology to assess and treat the patient within the scope of paramedic practice. Paramedic graduates will demonstrate proper handling of the patient to minimize discomfort, prevent further injury, and perform drug calculations and medication administration safely during patient care. Graduates will identify operational knowledge in such areas as communication, transportation, inventory and custody of accounts and laws related to Paramedic and healthcare practice. Graduates will exhibit cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills in out-of-hospital care dealing with environmental safety of the accident\/trauma patient. Licensure and Certification The student must pass the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) exam. Students graduating from Northark\u2019s EMS programs meet the requirements to take the NREMT exam and are eligible to apply to states that require the NREMT for state licensure. Upon the successful completion of the NREMT exam, the student becomes Nationally certified. This is a National certification but not a state license. After graduation, EMT and paramedic students must apply to the desired state to become state-licensed. We are unsure of other specific licensure qualifications that some states may require. Some states specify more stringent requirements and it would be up to the student to look up the requirements for those states.
