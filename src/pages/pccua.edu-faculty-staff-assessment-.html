Our Mission The Mission of PCCUA emphasizes a commitment to helping every student succeed. The College provides high-quality, accessible educational opportunities and skills development to promote life-long learning and engages in the lives of our students and our communities. What is Assessment? Assessment is the ongoing process of establishing clear, measurable, expected outcomes of student learning; systematically gathering, analyzing, and interpreting evidence to determine how well performance matches those expectations and using the resulting information to understand and improve student learning throughout the College. Assessment promotes quality across the institution by providing evidence to guide effective decision-making regarding institutional changes, programmatic changes, and classroom teaching modifications. Three key purposes of assessment: To Inform - Assessment activities show a clearer picture of what is really happening in a program and inform others of program contributions. To Improve - This evaluation is formative. Assessment activities provide a feedback loop to help shape or form better programs and services. To Prove - This evaluation is summative. Assessment activities provide evidence to sum up what a program is accomplishing and provide persuasive indicators to students, faculty, staff, and the community. Institutional Changes Resulting from Assessment Identification and prioritizing of assessment goals Adapting the referral form so that it is used in a more comprehensive way Examination of the current advising system Establishing an Assessment webpage for publishing assessment outcomes, information, and resources Publication of division and institutional assessment outcomes Increased interdivisional communication and cooperation to achieve assessment and other goals Examination and modification of documents used to identify learning outcomes Clarification of divisional roles in assessment Increased knowledge of divisional and student service responsibilities toward student assessment Greater desire by faculty and administrators to gauge student learning outcomes and use data to make decisions contributing toward better instruction Cooperative effort of divisions within the College and an appreciation for each division's role in assessment Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Annual Assessment Results 2018-2019 Assessment 2017-2018 Assessment 2016-2017 Assessment 2015-2016 Assessment 2014-2015 Assessment 2013-2014 Assessment 2012-2013 Assessment Graduate Survey Responses Graduate Survey Responses 2015-2021 Division and Department Annual Strategies and Planning 2018-19 Allied Health Applied Technology Arts and Science - FIG English Analysis Fall 2018 Spring 2019 - FIG Reading Analysis - FIG Math Analysis Business and Information Systems 2017-18 Allied Health Applied Technology Arts and Science - FIG Reading Analysis (consolidated) - FIG Math Analysis - FIG English Analysis Business and Information Systems 2016-17 Allied Health Applied Technology Arts and Science - FIG Reading Analysis - FIG Math Analysis Business and Information Systems 2015-16 Allied Health Applied Technology Arts and Science - FIG Reading Analysis - FIG Math Analysis - FIG English Analysis Business and Information Systems Co-Curricular Assessment Co-Curricular Assessment Schedule 2020 Student Focus Group Response - Ambassadors 2020 Student Focus Group Response - Book Club 2020 Student Focus Group Response - Career Pathways 2020 Student Focus Group Response - TTOP Debbie Hardy Director of Student Success and Institutional Effectiveness Helena-West Helena Campus Phone: (870) 338-6474, Ext. 1242 Email: dhardy@pccua.edu File Name Type Size Home Employment University of Arkansas System Helpdesk Contact Accessibility Statement Website Design by: Younger Associates"}
