Financial aid is funding that helps students and families pay for the cost of college. Need-based financial aid, such as the Pell Grant, Supplemental grants and Work-Study, are provided on the basis of the financial need of the student and is generally determined by your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Other types of financial aid are not determined by need, such as loans and merit-based scholarships. We offer a variety of financial aid options, including scholarships, grants, loans and Federal Work-Study. Here\u2019s a quick look at each and where to find more information.
