Participants generally do not need to have a certain level of prior education. These non credit courses are not designed to meet college degree requirements, but may provide needed CEUs (continuing education units) for professionals upgrading their skills or needing industry recognized certifications. Register in person, on the phone, online, or email. Registration fees vary from course to course and are listed in the current On-Campus schedule. If a student will not be able to attend a course, requests for refunds or transfers of 100% of payment should be made at least five (5) business days prior to the first class meeting. Canceled Classes Help us keep your selected class on schedule. Register early! Each class has a minimum required enrollment to make. We may cancel a class because we did not know you planned to take it. We have to cancel classes with low enrollment ahead of time, so sign up at least one week in advance to reserve your seat. Encourage a friend to join you. Sometimes two or three people make a difference between a class making and being cancelled. Interested in Teaching a Class?
