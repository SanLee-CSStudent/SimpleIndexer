The University of Central Arkansas (UCA) values, supports and advances diversity. We recognize it as a critical and important part of creating and maintaining a vibrant campus community and academic life, as well as helping develop leaders. Our goal is to cultivate campus communities that not only are open, welcoming, and respectful, but also that promote the continuous increase of cultural awareness and understanding throughout the campus. We are committed to creating and maintaining an environment that is socially, culturally, and globally competent. We seek to attract a more diverse campus population (students, faculty, and staff) that appreciates difference and maximizes the development and contributions of our community members.
