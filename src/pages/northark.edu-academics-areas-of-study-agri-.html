Faculty Contact Michelle Buchanan Agriculture Instructor (870) 391-3149 michelle.buchanan@northark.edu \"I have always loved most anything dealing with agriculture. Animals have always been something that I have been passionate about...The agriculture classes and Mrs. Buchanan at NAC are very informative and have really helped me in knowing that there is a wide variety of options. One of the most memorable things that Mrs. Buchanan has taught me is to not let where you are from define you, but shape who you are and what you become.\" - Jessica Williamson, agri student Learning Outcomes Students will demonstrate knowledge of terminology, breeds, digestion, reproduction, and production related to animal and poultry science.
