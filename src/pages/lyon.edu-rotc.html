View More View More About Army ROTC An affiliate of the Arkansas State University ROTC program, the Lyon College ROTC (Reserve Officers Training Corps) Program is dedicated to developing quality leaders for the United States Army. ROTC has a history of producing top-quality leaders who have gone on to hold high-paying jobs, public office, and high-ranking military positions. For more information contact Mr. David Hastings at dhastings@AState.edu.

Cadets who have prior service and have completed basic combat training are only required to take the junior- and senior-level courses. Physical fitness training is a required part of the ROTC curriculum. The number of days a Cadet is required to attend is dependent on classification. Additionally, a two-hour lab is conducted each week to put classroom knowledge into practical application. Our Cadets are active in a variety of social and scholastic organizations. We offer classes in leadership, rappelling, marksmanship and military history, as we continue to develop tomorrow\u2019s leaders. MSL I This is the freshman-level course required for cadets who have not attended basic training. This course teaches an introduction to leadership. Cadets learn basic soldiering skills, Army values, health and fitness, effective communication and U.S. Military Customs and Courtesies. This course will prepare cadets for Basic Camp in Fort Knox, Kentucky. MSL II This is the sophomore-level course required for all cadets who have not completed basic training. Cadets continue to build a strong foundation in leadership, team building, Army briefing, interpersonal communication, effective writing, Army rank and structure, duties, traditions, map reading, land navigation and an introduction to troop-leading procedures. Cadets will be exposed to battle drills and patrolling. MSL III This is the junior-level course required for all Cadets to commission as an Army Officer. Completion of MSL I, MSL II and Basic Camp is required for all cadets who have not completed basic training. Cadets will learn tactical leadership, squad combat operations, operations orders, and troop leading. This course prepares cadets for the Advanced Camp in Fort Knox, Kentucky, before the senior-level course. MSL IV This is the senior-level course required for all Cadets to commission as an Army Officer. This is the last stop before obtaining the rank of Second Lieutenant (2LT). Completion of MSL I, MSL II, MSL III, Basic Camp, and Advanced Camp are prerequisites for MSL IV. Cadets are placed in either a Command or Battalion Staff position to gain experience in planning and operations. Basic Camp Conducted annually at Fort Knox, Kentucky, develops well-disciplined, highly motivated, physically conditioned students to improve self-confidence, initiative and leadership potential through progressive practical experience in leadership techniques. It informs students of the significance of military courtesy, discipline and customs, and traditions of the service. The training also provides cadets the opportunity to participate in intensive periods of outdoor practical work and acquaints them with group living, the military environment and military discipline. Completion of Basic Camp or Army Basic Combat Training (BCT) is a prerequisite for non-traditional MSL III Cadets. Advanced Camp Each Cadet is required to attend four weeks of Warrior Forge as a prerequisite for commissioning. Because of the impact Warrior Forge has on the Cadet\u2019s future, it is imperative that he or she be adequately prepared before arrival. Warrior Forge is held after the summer of the MSL III year, and is a prerequisite for MSL IV.
