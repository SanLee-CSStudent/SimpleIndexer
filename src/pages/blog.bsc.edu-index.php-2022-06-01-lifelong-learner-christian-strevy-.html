{"id":731,"title":"Lifelong Learner: Christian Strevy \u2013 THE BSC BLOG","url":"https:\/\/blog.bsc.edu\/index.php\/2022\/06\/01\/lifelong-learner-christian-strevy\/","content":"Lifelong Learner: Christian Strevy Christian Strevy, who earned a BFA in art at Birmingham-Southern College in 2010, strongly exemplifies the school\u2019s value of lifelong learning. He has a wide, ever-growing range of interests, including plants, animals, insects, and geology. And Strevy \u2013 now a Philadelphia-based filmmaker \u2013 is also hosting a series of YouTube videos to explore these interests and share them with the world. The series, \u201COld Scout,\u201D began in 2018 by depicting Strevy\u2019s quest to earn all the merit badges from Cub Scout to Eagle Scout in one year. That quest stemmed from Strevy\u2019s regrets about dropping out of Cub Scouts when he was 10 years old. He quit before he had a chance to enjoy the outdoor scouting activities, such as camping, he had come to love as an adult. Strevy successfully completed that initial one-year stage of the \u201COld Scout\u201D series in 2019. And Strevy \u2013 along with series co-creator and fellow BSC graduate Julie St. John \u201911 \u2013 resumed \u201COld Scout\u201D in 2020 after a pandemicinduced hiatus. The project began with Strevy wondering if he could complete all the merit badges in one year. \u201CIt was a little bit of a stunt,\u201D he said. But \u201COld Scout\u201D became something more. Strevy and St. John, who earned a BFA in 2011, have continued the series because it\u2019s an entertaining way to explore subjects they have \u201Cstrong curiosity\u201D about, Strevy said. A Vestavia Hills native, Strevy earned an MFA in film in 2015 from Temple University in Philadelphia. At Temple, he made a web series, \u201CGunner Jackson,\u201D that was shown at numerous film festivals, including Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham. Strevy began \u201COld Scout\u201D on his 30th birthday, June 14, 2018, and a year later, he filmed an episode that was based on an Eagle Scout graduation. For that episode, Strevy, St. John, and friends staged a pinewood derby, the wood-car racing event popular in scouting. Strevy said he and St. John like the old Boy Scouts curriculum from the 1950s and before. \u201CIt was more experiment-based or adventure-based,\u201D he said. In the newer curriculum, the rocks and minerals merit badge book, for example, \u201Cis more like a book report,\u201D Strevy said. In the old curriculum, scouts were told to collect 25 rocks and minerals in the field. Making the episodes \u201Cis a great way to start hobbies and learn about science.\u201D For example, he started collecting insects and is making an episode about them. He even became interested in stamp collecting. \u201CWe did that episode, and I realized they\u2019re tiny, beautiful, little engraved works of art that you put on mail,\u201D Strevy said. Since restarting \u201COld Scout,\u201D Strevy and St. John have made two more episodes. St. John does \u201Cthe tedious, hard work of producing the episodes,\u201D Strevy said, while he directs and does most of the editing. \u201CWe\u2019re just doing them at our own pace and taking our time doing them, which is really fun,\u201D Strevy said.
