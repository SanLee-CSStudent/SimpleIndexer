A motion was made by Trustee Lovell, seconded by Trustee Evans, and unanimously approved. Board Comments Dr. Esters presented the Skills Guarantee: As a demonstration of our confidence in the quality of our technical programs, North Arkansas College will issue a 100% Skills Guarantee for our graduates or students who have completed technical courses in 2020. This Guarantee is intended to instill confidence to employers that students affected by the March, 2020 shift in instructional delivery have attained all skills necessary to accomplish their job duties. A claim may be filed by either the employer in conjunction with a graduate or student who has completed a course of study if the individual is unable to perform one or more of the competencies described in a course syllabi or description of a course for which they were awarded a grade of \u201CC\u201D or better during the Spring 2020 semester. If the claim is verified, the student will be retrained in those skills for free and as soon as possible but not longer than six months after the claim is filed (extenuating circumstances considered). In other words, if a student was awarded a grade of \u201CC\u201D or better in spring 2020, Northark will guarantee they know what they are supposed to know or we will re-train them for free. Trustee Fendley motioned and Lovell seconded the vote to support, and unanimously approved.
