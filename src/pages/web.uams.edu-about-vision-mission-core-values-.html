With this bold statement, UAMS resolved that in the coming decade its status as Arkansas\u2019 only academic health system will allow it to deliver dramatic and lasting health and health care improvements to its home state. Aiding in this vision will be its statewide network of campuses for public education and clinical outreach, along with cores of expertise in medical specialties, population health, digital health, health informatics and translational research. UAMS chose to culminate its 10-year Vision 2029 strategic plan on the 150th anniversary of its creation in 1879 as the first medical school in Arkansas. New strategic objectives build on achievements from its previous Vision 2020 plan, which led UAMS to create an integrated, patient- and family-centered clinical enterprise; focus on educating culturally competent health professionals equipped to practice team-care; and continue to develop and expand nationally recognized research programs that advanced scientific and public health knowledge.
