Many ask: what is a provost? Simply put, the provost is the university\u2019s chief academic officer. Along with a dedicated staff, I oversee and collaborate with the many deans, chairs, directors, and administrative staff members who empower students with knowledge that changes the world. Also serving as the vice president for academic affairs, I promote UAB\u2019s distinctive academic vision and ensure our institution stays in line with our mission and is achieving carefully planned strategic initiatives. The Office of the Provost has primary responsibility for academic planning, international initiatives, institutional equity, and institutional research. In all of these areas, we seek to support our colleagues in their work and to enable collaborative efforts to achieve shared goals. Our team\u2019s priority is fostering an environment for world-class faculty that stimulates teaching and research efforts. This website includes resources for you and guidance on how we can help support your teaching and research. We want to hear from you, so please reach out to us here if we can be of any assistance.
