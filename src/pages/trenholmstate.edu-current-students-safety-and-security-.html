TrenCAST is dedicated to the success of students by stepping in to connect students to relevant resources and outside agencies. The team may have to communicate with the reporting party to accurately assess the needs of the student. The team may reach out to the student to understand his\/her needs and develop a plan of action for his\/her success.
