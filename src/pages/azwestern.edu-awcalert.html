AWC Alert is a messaging service that allows registered users to receive emergency alert messages on their text-capable cell phones or other mobile devices and via email. We provide this service at no cost to registered users; however, standard text messaging fees charged by your cell phone provider may still apply. Administered by members of the AWC Emergency Operations Center, AWC Alert messages will be sent out in an emergency. The AWC Alert system will not be used to distribute advertising or other unsolicited content. AWC has contracted with e2Campus, a mass notification provider working with universities nationwide to add text messaging to their emergency communications plans. Please review and agree to the terms of service before registering for an account. If you have questions about the registration process, call the Service Desk at (928) 317-5892 or email servicedesk@azwestern.edu. Register for an Account!
