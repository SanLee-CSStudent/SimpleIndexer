Students born before January 1, 1957 are exempt from this requirement. Admission Decisions Applications are processed on a rolling basis throughout the year. We estimate approximately three weeks to process your application. This estimation is based on complete applications (i.e., application, transcript(s), and test scores (if applicable) are received).
