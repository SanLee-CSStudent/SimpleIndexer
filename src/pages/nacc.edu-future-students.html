Summer Course Delivery Moved to Online Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, NACC has made the decision to move all 2020 Summer courses Online! Courses originally scheduled for on-campus delivery will be taught online, which means all course content for the Summer term will be delivered via Canvas. *A limited number of courses will require on-campus labs. If you have already registered for an on-campus course and wish to remain in the course online, there is nothing more you need to do. If you have concerns about completing any courses online for the 2020 Summer term, please reach out to your advisor to discuss your options or to change your schedule. If you have yet to register for the upcoming term there is still time- contact your advisor to register today! NACC will continue to provide the same services during the Summer term as have been provided in the past.
