The first building, Old Main, was completed in 1890. It housed the School of Agriculture with classrooms, labs and a mess hall. There were many obstacles on the path to opening the university. However, we never gave up on our mission. Our first graduating class of three students in 1895 set us on an incredible journey of learning and discovery with stories of wonder that continue to shape our Wildcat spirit: The Morrill land-grant acts of 1862 and 1890 designated us as Arizona\u2019s Land-grant university Bear Down! Our beloved rallying cry, first heard in 1926, has become part of our core identity and is used by Arizona Wildcats all around the world In 1937 we invented tree-ring research and opened the first lab for dendrochronology We helped map the moon so that the Eagle could land in 1969 and sampled an asteroid in 2021 for the first time in U.S. history. #SpaceIsWildcatCountry Our military history runs deep. In 2016, on the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, we honored the service members killed on the USS Arizona with the USS Arizona Mall Memorial In Spring 2022, we open the new Student Success District, a restoration of iconic campus buildings with cutting-edge technologies and services to improve how students live, work and study. 1890 Land-grant designation and completion of Old Main 1926 The birth of \"Bear Down!\" 1937 Invention of tree-ring research 1969 NASA uses our lunar map to land on the moon 2016 Installation of the USS Arizona Mall Memorial 2021 The OSIRIS-REx mission samples asteroid Bennu Become a part of the University of Arizona STUDY HERE WORK HERE PARTNER WITH US Footer - Main Employment Emergency Information Title IX \/ Non-Discrimination Campus Safety UAlert Copyright Campus Accessibility Contact Us Feedback The University of Arizona | Tucson, Arizona 85721 | 520\u2011621\u20112211 Information For Future Students Current Students Faculty & Staff Alumni & Donors Parents & Visitors Corporations & Businesses Topics About the University Academics Arts & Museums Athletics & Recreation Colleges, Schools, Departments Diversity Environment & Sustainability Global Engagement Health & Medical Libraries Outreach & Extension Research & Innovation Purpose, Mission & Values Resources A-Z Index Calendars Campus Map News Phonebook Weather Connect Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn YouTube We respectfully acknowledge the University of Arizona is on the land and territories of Indigenous peoples.
