At least from where I come from in Mumbai, it\u2019s a city, and it\u2019s a fast city. People don\u2019t have time for you. But when I came to Flagstaff, I was like, wow, people randomly smile at you. People are so friendly. They care about you. Now, I cherish that.\u201D \u2013 Glen D'Silva, pursuing a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering, Flagstaff Campus"}
