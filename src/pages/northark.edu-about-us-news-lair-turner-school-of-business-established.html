Longtime benefactors, Stephen Lair and Steve Turner, are making a $1M gift to endow the Lair & Turner School of Business at Northark. Trustees voted to name the school in recognition of the gift during the meeting. Steve Turner said \u201CWe are honored and grateful for the opportunity to gift Northark and specifically the business school. Stephen and I believe the future economic growth of Harrison, the state of Arkansas and America is educating the talent of tomorrow; hopefully, our investment will have an impact.\u201D Dr. Rodney Arnold, executive director of the Foundation and vice president of institutional advancement said the donation will positively influence the quality of education students receive in the future, saying \u201CThis level of support will make a significant impact on the business opportunities we provide to students. New experiences, programs and enhanced business offerings will directly stem from Mr. Turner and Mr. Lair\u2019s gift. Their generosity is admirable.\u201D Earnings from the endowment fund will be used to offset annual operating expenses of the Business Department at North Arkansas College. The Lair & Turner School of Business is located inside the John Paul Hammerschmidt building on the south campus. A naming ceremony will be held next spring and the public will be invited to attend.
