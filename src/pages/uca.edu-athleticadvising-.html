Who We Are: Our office is comprised of three full-time staff members. Each one is dedicated to the academic welfare of our student-athletes. As our mission states, we want to see our student-athletes as successful in life as they are on the field. That success is determined, for the most part, by what takes place within the classroom. Between our four staff members, we have years of experience with the University of Central Arkansas as either students, staff, or alumni. That experience is all brought to bear to help assist our students with their academic goals. What We Do: With all of our years of experience with UCA, we are able to deliver a multitude of resources and services to our students and their coaches.
