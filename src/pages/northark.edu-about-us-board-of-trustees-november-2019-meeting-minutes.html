There being none, the agenda stood approved. Regular Reports: Finance Report: Don Sugg shared financials through October 31. He said we have four months behind us and third way through the fiscal year. He highlighted over the first four months and focused on the tuition and mandatory fees. In the E&G fund, tuition revenue is little ahead of our budget. The big increase in revenue is in part with the sale of the center campus and the $3 increase in tuition. He stated the expenses are trending with salary and benefits. Don reported our total annual budget hours are 38, 500, about 1100 hours down from what we budged last year. Don went over the tuition fees covered the analysis to year- to- date for this year compared to last year- to \u2013date and reported there is a shift in the residency, with the In-state tuition down in hours but up in Out-of- state continuous and general. We are losing lower priced hours and gaining the upper priced hours. We are gaining out-of- state residency hours which is a positive stated Don. Auxiliary is facing challenges, but we are doing better than we did last year on the revenue side. The operations are doing well but the problem is cost to sale. He stated coming into year we lowered sales projection $1,084,150 for whole year with a gross margin targeted at$289,283 at 26.7 %. Year to date actual net profit to date is $50,802 at 8.2%. Sales are over 50% but the cost of sales is much higher. He stated they are looking at their book log but not sure if it\u2019s operating properly with it being the inventory and categorizing of inventory is being crossed. Cross categorizing can affect the margin markup. Don stated we may need to look at the activity, athletic fees, and programs to ride the ship for the Auxiliary fund. Trustee Miller asked if re-categorize correctly would help with the fund. Don replied he\u201D believes it could be better, but it would not be enough to offset the gross profit margin\u201D. Trustee McNew asked \u201Cwhat went well with the Out- of- state tuition.\u201D Don replied that heavy recruitment and we compare well with OTC and College of the Ozarks.
