This important classification is awarded following a process of self-study by each institution, which is then assessed by a national review committee led by the Swearer Center for Public Engagement at Brown University, the administrative and research home for the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification. \u201CThese newly-classified and reclassified institutions are doing exceptional work to forward their public purpose in and through community engagement that enriches teaching and research while also benefiting the broader community,\u201D said Mathew Johnson, executive director of the Swearer Center. \u201CWe are proud to have earned the prestigious Carnegie Community Engagement Classification,\u201D said UCA President Houston Davis. \u201CFrom our dedicated faculty and staff to our civic-minded students, members of the UCA campus community are committed to teaching, engaging, and serving our local community and beyond.\u201D Of the 119 institutions classified in the 2020 cycle, 44 are receiving the classification for the first time while 75 are now reclassified, after being classified originally in 2010 or 2015. These 119 institutions join the 240 institutions that earned the classification during the 2015 selection process, for a total of 359 campuses who are currently active holders of this important designation. Among the 2020 recipients of the classification, UCA joins 66 other public institutions and 52 private that represent campuses in 37 states and U.S. territories. The Carnegie Community Engagement Classification has been the leading framework for institutional assessment and recognition of community engagement in U.S. higher education for the past 14 years with multiple classification cycles in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2015 and 2020. ABOUT THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING: The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching aims to build a field around the use of improvement science and networked improvement communities to solve long-standing inequities in educational outcomes. The Foundation, through the work of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, developed the first typology of American colleges and universities in 1970 as a research tool to describe and represent the diversity of U.S. higher education. The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education (now housed at Indiana University Bloomington\u2019s Center for Postsecondary Research) continues to be used for a wide range of purposes by academic researchers, institutional personnel, policymakers and others.
