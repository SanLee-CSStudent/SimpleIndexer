Now that you\u2019re here at UAB you have a chance to explore your interests through co-curricular, research, and experiential learning opportunities. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being undeclared, in fact an estimated 30% of students entering college are undeclared. The Exploratory Academic Advisors in the VMASC are equipped to help you discover where your interests translate into a major and someday a career. Some decide quickly, others take longer, but at the end of the day there\u2019s no right or wrong way to decide your program of study. Just know that we\u2019re dedicated to help you make the choice that\u2019s right for you. Declaring Your Major All students must declare a degree-awarding major by the time they earn 60 semester hours of coursework, including courses currently in progress, before registering for the next semester. Students who (1) have been dismissed from a degree-awarding major or professional program, (2) have over 60 semester hours of coursework, including courses currently in progress, and (3) are in a non-degree awarding major must declare a new degree-awarding major before enrolling for a second semester. Students who do not declare a major within the stated time-frame will not be allowed to register for the next term and must contact their academic advisor and change their major before enrolling. Students enrolling at UAB for the first time and who have previously earned 75 or more hours must declare a degree-awarding major during their first term of enrollment. Conditions for acceptance of a student into a major vary by department, school, and college. Majors should be declared or changed online at BlazerNET. Some majors are subject to additional admission requirements and enrollment limitations. Read more Ready to Declare Your Major?
