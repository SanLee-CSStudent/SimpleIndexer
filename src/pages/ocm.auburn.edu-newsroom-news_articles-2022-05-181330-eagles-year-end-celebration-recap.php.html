Held May 6 at the Auburn Alumni Association headquarters on College Street, the 2022 awards luncheon was a festive and well-attended affair that had something for everyone, including fun, food and even a visit from Aubie himself. The ceremony served as an upbeat end to a banner year for the EAGLES program, which is part of the Department of Special Education, Rehabilitation and Counseling, or SERC, in the College of Education. Luncheon attendees included former Auburn Board of Trustees member Sarah Newton, all nine EAGLES who participated in commencement after completing two- or four-year certifications, other EAGLES students and their families, campus partners and staff. Bradley Basden, Josh Greiner and Anna Moates\u2014who established the program\u2019s first cohort four years ago\u2014were honored for completing the four-year experience, while Grace Davis, Andrew Day, Rosa Juan, D\u2019Vonte Morris, Sadie Weldon and Luke York were celebrated for fulfilling the two-year program. JoAnne Coggins, chair of the EAGLES Engagement Council, began the day\u2019s remarks by talking about how far the program has come and the unique opportunities it provides all who become involved. \u201CWe are so proud of our program and our staff,\u201D said Coggins, a 1975 Auburn graduate. \u201CTo be an advocate for and educate people about a program like this is a great opportunity for us. To the graduates, I would just like to say congratulations for all your hard work, all your persistence, your humor, your guidance and all of the things you\u2019ve been able to teach members of the council and the staff. \u201CYou EAGLES who are graduating and others who are still in the program are going to be the next group of pioneers. You are going to take this program forward and take all that you have learned here to assure that the next generation is going to have much better opportunities than even you have had. Please keep dreaming about what\u2019s coming next.\u201D College of Education Dean Jeffrey Fairbrother sent along a special video message for the students and celebration attendees. \u201CToday is a great day for the EAGLES program and the College of Education,\u201D Fairbrother said. \u201CTo our graduating and continuing EAGLES students, on behalf of the entire College of Education, please know that we are very proud of you. Today is an opportunity to celebrate all you have accomplished, and it is also an opportunity to set new goals. \u201CI encourage you all to keep challenging yourselves and continue soaring to new heights.\u201D The group also was treated to a video from Jay Gogue, who handed over the reins as Auburn University president to Christopher B. Roberts on May 16. \u201CThis is a special day where we get to say thank you and congratulations to our EAGLES students and graduates,\u201D Gogue said. \u201CIt\u2019s particularly special because I understand this is the first time we\u2019ve had a four-year cohort that has graduated, and so we\u2019re awfully excited about that graduation and about each of you, each family and what you\u2019ve done. \u201CA university is about helping people achieve their hopes and dreams, and certainly the EAGLES program plays an important part at Auburn University.\u201D Awards, accolades abound Several awards were doled out at the celebration, including the Outstanding EAGLES Student award that went to D\u2019Vonte Morris. Morris was one of six EAGLES students who completed his two-year program at the end of spring semester, and he was all smiles during his acceptance speech. \u201CI am honored to accept the Student of the Year Award,\u201D said Morris, who also took home the \u201CMost Helpful\u201D honors during the superlatives portion of the day. \u201CIn the past two years, I have improved my independence, time management and [ability to] be a wonderful student. I have had the opportunity to work and attend social events, hang out with my friends and have fun along the way. \u201CBeing part of this program has made me realize a lot about myself as an individual. This inclusive education program has given me a new view of the world, and it has made me realize that, if you believe in yourself and put in the work, anything is possible. I hope that I continue to learn and grow so that I can one day live independently in the real world.\u201D Newton, a longtime EAGLES supporter, received the Legacy Award for her guidance and passion for the program. \u201CToday is a dream come true for me,\u201D said Newton, who served as a trustee for 14 years. \u201CTo the parents, thank you for entrusting us with your most valuable possession\u2014your children. I know it was hard to leave them the first time, so thank you for believing in Auburn. I just want to say thank you to our students. \u201CIt seems just like yesterday that Bradley, Anna and Josh arrived on campus, and I remember that day. You were all very excited but filled with just a little angst. You have completed four years, and it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m so proud of you. Students, because I believe in you, I believe in Auburn, and I love it. I can\u2019t wait to see what you do when you go out and change the world.\u201D Erin Greer, a Birmingham native who graduated summa cum laude with a degree in rehabilitation and disability studies, was honored as the outstanding peer mentor from the Warm-hearted Individuals Nurturing Great Success, or WINGS, group that works in tandem with the EAGLES students. Greer will continue her studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where she has been accepted into the Doctor of Occupational Therapy program. \u201CWithout a doubt, this was the best part of my college experience,\u201D said Greer, whose adopted brother, Garrett, has Down\u2019s Syndrome. \u201CI wanted to be involved with the EAGLES program so that I could foster new relationships, promote inclusion and independence and understand more about disability within the higher education system. My family adopted Garrett almost eight years ago, and he changed my life forever. \u201CInclusivity is rooted deep into my heart and in the hearts of so many others here. I seek to live in a world where disability isn\u2019t seen as an interference to normalcy, but where people are defined based on who they are on the inside rather than by societal labels. I will take all the valuable lessons I learned here in this program and use them to empower more individuals to go after their dreams, just like so many of you have done here.\u201D Other awards included: Outstanding Employment Partner of the Year\u2014Helen Baggett, Auburn Athletics; Outstanding Instructor of the Year\u2014Carolyn Huntington, Department of Animal Sciences; Outstanding Residence Life Partner of the Year\u2014Lindsey Sharpe, University Housing; and Outstanding Campus Collaborator of the Year\u2014Lindsey Piazza and Laura Plexico, Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences. Super surprises galore Professor Jeff Reese, head of the SERC department, added a curve ball to the program by announcing an array of surprises. Reese delivered the monumental news that the program has received an anonymous gift of more than $3 million that will secure the future of EAGLES for many years to come. \u201CThe donor is addressing immediate needs while providing the program with matching dollars for increased scholarships,\u201D Reese said. \u201CThe goal is to create enough scholarships for every EAGLES student. The donor has helped safeguard the future of the program so that each year the program will have additional capital and resources to support students.\u201D Reese also revealed that Betty Patten, director of the EAGLES program, received the inaugural Jay and Susie Gogue Endowed Directorship for her commitment to taking the EAGLES to new heights. Under her leadership, EAGLES has thrived in its goals of providing a postsecondary education opportunity for students with intellectual disabilities to engage in a two- or four-year campus experience while helping them achieve their employment and independent living goals. \u201CUnder your leadership, EAGLES has flourished in a short time,\u201D Reese said of Patten. \u201CYour passion, your vision and seemingly endless energy\u2014along with your wonderful staff\u2014have transformed the EAGLES into a gold-standard program. EAGLES has become interwoven into the Auburn fabric and in the Auburn Family, and I am so proud of the EAGLES program and that they are housed in our department.\u201D In his video, Fairbrother echoed Reese\u2019s praise for Patten, an assistant clinical professor of special education who has been involved with the EAGLES program since 2019 after earning her doctorate in special education from Auburn in 2017. \u201CYou have been a fierce advocate for the EAGLES program, successfully expanding your staff and graduate support for students, adding new on-campus and off-campus partnerships to strengthen the program and enrich the student experience and fundraising more than $5 million to help underwrite meal plans, housing and scholarships to help make the program more accessible to all,\u201D Fairbrother said of Patten. \u201CYour work ethic is truly exemplary, and your heart for service and students is inspiring. It is only fitting that Auburn\u2019s first-ever endowed directorship be awarded to a person with your character, integrity and passion.\u201D While overwhelmed and truly honored, Patten quickly shifted the focus of the event back to the EAGLES and those who laid the groundwork before her. \u201CI\u2019m so thankful, but don\u2019t want this to overshadow the EAGLES,\u201D Patten said. \u201CYou are why we are here today, and I am so thankful to be a part of your journey. I\u2019m excited for all that has happened and all that is to come. I truly feel the best is yet to come for the future of our graduates and this program. \u201CWe choose to take this program in a direction that doesn\u2019t just benefit people individually, but holistically in a way that is not only filled with excellence but is sustainable so that more people have this opportunity. Before you know it, this will just be something that exists everywhere and won\u2019t be celebrated in the sense that it\u2019s remarkable, because you all are already remarkable individuals who deserve to be a part of every conversation and have a seat at every table. You are changing the way, and I\u2019m so excited.\u201D Patten then announced a surprise of her own, the establishment of a scholarship named in honor of one of the EAGLES\u2019 founders, retiring SERC Professor Karen Rabren. Rabren, the Mildred Cheshire Fraley Distinguished Professor, received the Pioneer Award and was shocked to discover her legacy will live on forever in the form of the Karen S. Rabren Endowed Scholarship. \u201CAfter a lifetime of work in the field of special education and transition, she has dedicated her life to service,\u201D Patten said of her mentor. \u201CShe has invested her time, energy and resources in addition to all she has done for students with disabilities. She has provided transformational change, not just in her family, but in her community, here at Auburn University and for every single EAGLES student and their families. \u201CShe has integrity, lives her life with purpose and does everything with excellence. Dr. Rabren has had a long journey in the field of special education and transition, and she also has endured a lot of challenges to help make sure this program was safeguarded over the years.\u201D Onward and upward The festivities included an official welcome for the graduating EAGLES and WINGS peer mentors into the Auburn Alumni Association family by Danielle Fields of the Auburn Office of Advancement. Fields announced the creation of an EAGLES and WINGS Auburn Affiliate group that will help with scholarship fundraising and outreach efforts. \u201COften times, when you think about graduation, you think about goodbyes, but at the Auburn Alumni Association, we really view graduation as the beginning of a new chapter,\u201D Fields said. \u201CWe welcome you into the family and want to make sure you have opportunities to take Auburn with you and stay connected with the university that gave you so many great memories. We want to ensure that you take a piece of Auburn with you wherever you go when you graduate, so we are working diligently to develop this affiliate group that will be impactful and inclusive of your time, your talents and your treasures.\u201D Stacy Greiner-Farmer, the mother of EAGLES four-year graduate Josh Greiner, offered the parents\u2019 perspective and capped the day\u2019s remarks with thank-yous and advice. \u201CFour years ago, they started as EAGLES students at Auburn University. Now, they are Auburn students who happen to be in the EAGLES program,\u201D Greiner-Farmer said of the program\u2019s first cohort. \u201CYou are all a true representation of Auburn, the Auburn Creed and the EAGLES program, and I\u2019m proud to know that this program continues to have smart, thoughtful and amazing people to carry on the legacy. To all the graduates\u2014continue to be lifelong learners, continue to put into practice all the Auburn experience and EAGLES has taught you, live by the creed, immerse yourselves into all things Auburn and roll Toomer\u2019s every chance you get. To the parents, my advice to you is to enjoy every minute, support and guide, do not control, go to the tailgate, go to Toomer\u2019s, grocery shop and attend a gymnastics meet. You\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\u201D Greiner-Farmer closed with thoughts about what the program and Auburn has meant to her and her son. \u201CThis is a gift that at one time was not an option,\u201D she said. \u201CIt has meant opportunity, quality of education, friendships to last a lifetime and recognition for ability. It has meant that Auburn has a culture that is inclusive. It means that our son can walk across a graduation stage along with his peers and celebrate this rite of passage. \u201CIt means that, when Coach Bruce Pearl deemed Auburn the \u2018everything school,\u2019 that \u2018everything school\u2019 included the EAGLES. I understand that Auburn Family is forever.\u201D 1 2 3 4 5 6 Link to Image 1 Auburn's EAGLES students posed for a photo with Aubie at their annual year-end celebration at the Auburn Alumni Association building on May 6.
