HEALTH, WELLNESS, AND PREVENTION INFORMATION What is Coronavirus? COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people may experience post-COVID conditions. These post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 have proven to be safe and effective. Learn more at the CDC\u2019s main Covid-19 website. How is ATU responding? All of the efforts currently in place by ATU are in response to the guidance by the CDC as well as ADH. ATU has relied upon the expert advice of medical, scientific, and public health officials to guide our policies and procedures throughout the current Covid-19 pandemic. We have also implemented a COVID-19 task force that continuously monitors and implements new guidance to engage in best practices, as well as do our part to limit the spread of the virus among our campus and alleviate the strain on our state\u2019s health care system. What do I do if I feel sick? Remember that COVID-19 symptoms can be very similar to other respiratory viruses. These symptoms may include: cough, fever, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. There are other symptoms as well not listed here. Since these symptoms can also be present in other viruses such as influenza, testing may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. If you feel sick or think you may have COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, please stay home except to seek medical care. Call the ATU Health and Wellness Center before showing up for an appointment so we can take precautionary measures to keep others in the waiting area of the clinic safe. You will also need to immediately separate yourself from others as much as possible, monitor your symptoms, wear a mask to prevent spread of illness, and get tested. Please complete the COVID-19 Reporting Form at atu.medicatconnect.com to report your symptoms to the ATU Health and Wellness Center. They will contact you with more information. How does it spread? According to the CDC and Arkansas Department of Health, Coronavirus is spread in the same ways as other virus illnesses like common influenza or colds. Your keys to limiting exposure to all viruses are similar: Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizers can be an effective alternative. For more on handwashing, please visit https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/handwashing\/ Here\u2019s a video from CDC: What You Need To Know About Handwashing Disinfect surfaces that people touch frequently Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth \u2013 germs often spread when a person touches something contaminated and then your eyes, nose or mouth. Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow if you cough or sneeze. Avoid contact with people who are sick. If you feel sick, please stay home. Learn more about how COVID-19 spreads at CDC I feel anxious. What can I do? We understand the concern of community members. The Novel Coronavirus outbreak adds a layer of stress and worry. If you would like to talk to someone, student support is available at the ATU Health and Wellness Center. Information about counselors in the community is available. Coping with Coronavirus Resources What is the difference between quarantine and isolation? You quarantine when you may have been exposed to the virus. This requires you to stay home and away from others in the home for 14 days to monitor for any symptoms that may develop. If you develop symptoms during or after quarantine, isolate yourself from others and contact your healthcare provider immediately for testing. You isolate when you have been infected with the virus, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms. During isolation you should stay home and stay away from others in the home and use a \u201Csick room\u201D if possible. If you develop any serious symptoms including trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone, or any other serious or concerning symptoms, seek emergency care or call 911 immediately.
