Transcript Guidlines For Employment Onboarding Employee Checkout Employee Handbook Summer 2022 COVID-19 Operational Plan Trenholm State Community College is committed to maintaining a healthy and safe campus environment for all students, faculty, and staff during their return to campus. View COVID-19 Operational Plan Summer Youth Program Trenholm State Community College has partnered with the Alabama Department of Human Resources to slots for summer youth employment for governmental entities with infrastructure for summer youth employment. Eligible participants must be aged 16-24 and have household income below 200% of the 2021 Federal Poverty Level Guidelines. Summer Youth Employment allows opportunity to acquire life and job skills, as well as work experience while being reimbursed. This is also an opportunity for learning and growth in the skill gap areas that Alabama employers have deemed an urgent need in the labor force. Some examples of these areas include time management, dependability, and working well with others. Applicants must complete the application form, which is entitled the Eligibility and Affirmation for Summer Youth Employment (SYP-2074) to have eligibility determine for DHR slot reimbursement. If the participant is a minor child (less than 19) and in the home of a parent or guardian, the parent or guardian must ensure accuracy and completion of the form by their signature on the designated line. Income of any adult member (age 19- 24) of the household should be listed regardless of the source. Income of adults who are not parents of the applicants but who serve as guardians (grandparent, aunt, uncle, sibling, etc.) will not be counted. Additionally, income of persons who are unrelated to the applicant or income of relatives who live in the same home but who do not have guardian responsibilities for the applicant will not be counted.
