It's also a living story of the incredible odds the University has faced and overcome. It's Starvation Gulch. Founded in 1923, Starvation Gulch was an inspiration of Charles E. Bunnell, the University if Alaska Fairbanks's first president. Student built a mock town to serve as an entertainment facility by day and fuel for enormous bonfires by night. Bunnell wanted the fires to symbolize the passing of the torch of knowledge. Winter Carnival February What\u2019s more Alaskan than SNOW!? Winter Carnival is a way to break the monotony of the Fairbanks winter with invigorating and entertaining activities in February ranging from ice climbing to dog mushing and everything in between. Winter Carnival started as a tradition in the city of Fairbanks. The carnival was centered on the \"Polar Bear\" hockey team. Winter Carnival was also a time for students to get out and be involved with outdoor sports. In 1927 the students constructed a toboggan slide. Other winter sports that were popular were skiing and ice hockey. 1936 is one of the first recorded Winter Carnivals.
