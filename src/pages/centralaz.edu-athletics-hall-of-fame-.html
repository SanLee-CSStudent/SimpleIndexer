A quorum consists of five members. VOTING SYSTEM FOR VAQUERO ATHLETIC HALL OF FAME Step 1: A pre-screening committee made up of Athletic Department personnel, selected by the Athletic Director, will review all nominations and make an initial judgment on candidates. This committee will develop a list of what they deem to be the worthiest male and female candidates. Step 2: At the meeting, the Sports Information Specialist will distribute a list of all nominees and those which were deemed worthiest by the initial screening. Any Hall of Fame Committee member can ask that someone from the overall list be added to the top candidate list if they feel someone has been overlooked in the initial screening. Step 3: The committee members will then vote for the top 5 candidates in reverse rank order (5 best\u2026 1 least). Any nominees with a score less than 20 will be removed from this year\u2019s consideration. For those nominees not on anyone\u2019s top 5, the committee may determine which are unqualified, and thus do not belong in the pool for future consideration. Step 4: This last step is a vote on all remaining candidates. Each committee member will select at maximum 5 worthy candidates for the Hall of Fame. All candidates who receive 80% of the vote will be automatically inducted into the VAQUERO ATHLETIC HALL OF FAME. Understanding that there may be individuals who have given excellent support to athletics but don\u2019t otherwise qualify for the Hall of Fame, the committee by 2\/3 majority vote, can name a Vaquero Athletic Honor Award.
