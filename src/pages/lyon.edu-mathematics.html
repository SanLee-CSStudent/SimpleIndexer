By majoring or minoring in Mathematics, you will learn how math is a vital tool for understanding the world. The Mathematics major is both rigorous and flexible. You will receive a foundation of knowledge that you can build on with graduate studies in mathematics or professional training in areas such as law or engineering, and you will also have the flexibility to pursue minors in other liberal arts disciplines. % of Mathematics majors are employed or in grad school within 6 months of graduation :1 student-to-teacher ratio Meet the Faculty Details Courses Careers Admissions Internships Scholarships Why study Math at Lyon College? The mathematics major is unique in how well it complements other disciplines. Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as the \u201Cqueen of the sciences\u201D for this very reason. Lyon mathematics majors often double-major in Computer Science, Chemistry, Biology, or Economics. Lyon graduates have gone on to be very successful in a wide variety of careers, some of which are not directly tied to mathematics. Having a major in mathematics demonstrates the ability to think critically and be self-reliant. Faculty Members Dr. Jeremy Chapman, Dr. Tharanga Wijetunge, Dr. Christopher Schwanke Ways To Get Involved The mathematics professors at Lyon enjoy involving undergraduate students in their research. In fact, three students co-authored a peer-reviewed publication in the recent past. Students who take the opportunity to do undergraduate research must be self-motivated as the research is in addition to the regular coursework. Further, students interested in helping others with mathematics and gaining real-life experience may apply to Lyon Upward Bound Math Science, APPLE Upward Bound, and the Morrow Academic Center. A variety of positions are available including summer positions. Student Spotlight \u201CIt\u2019s a challenge but in a good way.
