Student Life ? Intramural Sports and Recreation Intramural Sports and Recreation Intramural Sports and Recreation provides a wide range of opportunities in the form of games and activities for all participants to experience in a friendly and engaging environment; without a lot of time commitment and the stress of extreme competitiveness. Our goal is to build comradery: close and sometimes lifelong friendships between groups of people or teammates; as well as enhance the value of Intramural sports and recreational activities on this campus of higher education. Intramural Sports (IM) differ from club sports, and varsity sports. IM Sports are less time consuming, not as competitive, requires less wear and tear on the body and is intended to be enjoyed by all participants. Recreation Activities (RA) provides a wide variety of leisure, learning and social group activities, special events on campus that also include day and overnight trips. Recreational activities are designed to help participants explore and enjoy moments in time. These activities are also intended to enhance the college experience for participants and provides an opportunity to build lifelong friendships. How to Sign Up All Intramural Sports & Recreation sign up will be in the Game Room located at 408 Tompkins Hall. Each team must have a team captain, complete a team registration form and submit it to the Intramural Sports and Recreation coordinator prior to league reaching team capacity or the registration deadline passes (whichever comes first). Participants must be enrolled TU students, or active TU faculty or staff. Each team that successfully completes their team registration before the league reaches capacity or the registration deadline passes (whichever comes first), will be entered into regular season play. From there, regular season intramural games are scheduled and played on or near campus once or twice per week, Monday-Friday, typically 6:30pm -10:00pm; and Saturdays at designated times. Following the regular season, all teams (unless they are excluded for game attendance or behavioral issues) are entered into the single elimination playoffs. Thanks for your interest. We look forward to seeing you on the fields and courts this year!
