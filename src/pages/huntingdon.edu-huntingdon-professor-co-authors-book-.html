The publisher writes, \u201CExhausted by extremism on both left and right, a majority of Americans\u2014Black and white\u2014love this country and want to do right by all of its citizens. In \u2018Black Liberation Through the Marketplace,\u2019 readers will come away with a better understanding of Black history and creative ideas for how to make this nation truly one with liberty and justice for all.\u201D According to Dr. Witcher, the book project grew out of a series of lectures Dr. Ferguson delivered to college students on ways in which civil society, and not government, had solved some of America\u2019s most difficult racial problems. Because student demand was high, Dr. Ferguson began to consider compiling the lectures into a book. She reached out to Dr. Witcher\u2019s graduate school adviser, Dr. David Beito, at the University of Alabama, who suggested she contact Dr. Witcher. \u201C\u201DI was immediately captivated by the scope of the project and believed that the stories she wanted to tell in the book were essential to the United States finding a way to address past injustice without jettisoning our liberal belief in the right to life, liberty, property, and the efficacy of markets,\u201D says Dr. Witcher. \u201CWe began working on the book in the fall of 2019 and actually co-authored the entire book through the pandemic, without ever working together in the same physical space.\u201D Dr. Witcher says that he and Dr. Ferguson share a hope that the book will lead readers to recognize \u201Cthat while there are some areas where government can, and must, make a difference when it comes to racial injustice, there are many more places where individuals engaged in civil society are the most important vehicles for meaningful change. [The book] is the story of how Black Americans forged voluntary organizations, created schools, became entrepreneurs, built businesses, and ultimately demanded equality in the face of state-sanctioned discrimination. The book also details the challenges we face today and offers solutions.\u201D Dr. Witcher joined the Huntingdon faculty in 2020. He earned his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Central Arkansas and Master of Arts and Ph.D. in history from the University of Alabama. His first book, \u201CGetting Right with Reagan: The Struggle for True Conservatism, 1980-2016,\u201D was published by the University Press of Kansas in 2019. Dr. Witcher is also the co-editor of the three-volume \u201CPublic Choice Analyses of Economic History (2018, 2018, 2019)\u201D and is the co-editor of \u201CConversations on Conservatism: Speeches from the Philadelphia Society\u201D (2021), with Dr. Blake Ball, Huntingdon assistant professor of history, and Kevin Hughes. Huntingdon College is a coeducational residential liberal arts college of the United Methodist Church offering more than thirty undergraduate programs of study and 21 NCAA-Division III athletic teams. Huntingdon recently added a Master of Athletic Training program, the College\u2019s first graduate program since its founding in 1854. ### Suellen (Su) Ofe Vice President for Marketing and Communications (334) 833-4515 | news@hawks.huntingdon.edu Share this post Share on facebook Facebook Share on google Google+ Share on twitter Twitter Share on linkedin LinkedIn Share on pinterest Pinterest Share on email Email Printer Friendly Archives Archives Select Month May 2022 (10) April 2022 (10) March 2022 (11) February 2022 (7) January 2022 (4) December 2021 (3) November 2021 (1) October 2021 (6) September 2021 (5) August 2021 (11) July 2021 (2) June 2021 (6) May 2021 (8) April 2021 (2) March 2021 (8) February 2021 (6) January 2021 (5) December 2020 (4) November 2020 (2) October 2020 (5) September 2020 (9) August 2020 (6) July 2020 (3) June 2020 (9) May 2020 (19) April 2020 (12) March 2020 (12) February 2020 (7) January 2020 (6) November 2019 (3) October 2019 (4) September 2019 (5) August 2019 (1) July 2019 (2) June 2019 (3) May 2019 (6) April 2019 (6) March 2019 (3) February 2019 (6) January 2019 (6) December 2018 (1) November 2018 (3) October 2018 (5) September 2018 (9) August 2018 (4) July 2018 (2) June 2018 (4) May 2018 (6) April 2018 (9) March 2018 (5) February 2018 (7) January 2018 (5) December 2017 (2) November 2017 (3) October 2017 (3) September 2017 (10) August 2017 (4) July 2017 (3) June 2017 (4) May 2017 (10) April 2017 (10) March 2017 (5) February 2017 (7) January 2017 (9) Popular Links Houghton Library Registrar's Office Student Financial Services Center for Career and Vocation Ability Sport Network Online Student Account Payments Emergency Procedures CARE Team Cayzu - Service Request System Facebook-f Instagram Twitter Linkedin-in webmaster@hawks.huntingdon.edu Search Huntingdon College is a college of the United Methodist Church.
