This is not a loan program. You have no debt, there are no interest or finance charges assessed, and there is no credit check. The cost to budget your interest-free monthly payment plan is a $25 per semester, per college non-refundable NBS\/FACTS Enrollment Fee. Payment Due Dates: Enroll early for best class selection. A $40 down payment ($25 enrollment fee and $15 registration fee) secures your classes, and activates a no-interest payment plan. The number of monthly payments depends on the date you enroll in the payment plan and the class(es) end date. Not all payment plans will extend to the end of the term. In order to secure classes the fee is due by midnight the day of registration. Payment plans are available for up to six months. Debit or credit cards also accepted.
