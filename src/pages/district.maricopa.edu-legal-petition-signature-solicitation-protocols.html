The links below will direct you to each college\u2019s specific procedures for solicitation of signatures. Each college president is authorized to designate general hours of accessibility for solicitation and a location on college premises where all representatives may solicit signatures. The location shall be in a common area where the solicitation will not serve as an obstruction to student activities or otherwise disrupt the college environment. College personnel are directed to enforce the requirements outlined within these documents.
