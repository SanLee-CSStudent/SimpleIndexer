The disbursement, from the U.S. Department of Education as part of the CRRSAA Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund II (HEERF II), is designed to prioritize students with the greatest demonstrated financial need. Huntingdon College has received $612,667 in supplemental funding to provide grants directly to students. Financial aid grants for students may be used for any component of the student\u2019s cost of attendance or for emergency costs that arise due to coronavirus, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health care), or child care. Eligibility In order to have been eligible for consideration, each receipt must have the following criteria: Have a completed and accepted 2020-2021 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on file with the Financial Aid Office.

Secondary consideration will be given to those students with a lower EFC (Expected Family Contribution). Individual award amounts for selected students will be no less than $250 and no more than $5,000. Distribution Huntingdon College will review all students enrolled as of February 26th and determine how much each student will receive by March 1st.

Distribution For the Fall 2021 distribution, Huntingdon College reviewed all students enrolled as of September 22, 2021 and determined how much each student received by September 23, 2021. Once the final award determination was made, students were notified via their Huntingdon College email if they were a HEERF III grant recipient. The notification specified that the student may choose to authorize HEERF III funds to be applied directly to their student account by completing a google form included in the email. In addition, it also included the date the check was available for pick up in Wilson 108 should the student not wish to authorize the funds be applied directly to their student account. For the Spring 2022 distribution, Huntingdon College will review all students enrolled as of January 24, 2022 and determine how much each student will receive by January 25, 2022. Once the final award determination has been made, students will be notified via their Huntingdon College email if they are a HEERF III grant recipient.

Huntingdon College signed and returned to the Department of Education (ED) the Recipient\u2019s Funding Certification and Agreement and in doing so provided assurance that the College has used, or intends to use no less than 50 percent of the funds received under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act for the sole purpose of providing emergency financial aid grants directly to students for their expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care expenses. In compliance with stated guidelines regarding funds received by Huntingdon College under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act, approximately $615,000 will be distributed directly to students in the form of Emergency Financial Aid Grants. Eligibility The CARES Act requires that students who receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants be eligible to participate in programs under Section 484 in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Students who have filed a completed FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) for the 2019-2020 academic year have demonstrated Section 484, Title IV eligibility. Therefore, students who meet the following requirements are eligible and encouraged to apply for Emergency Financial Aid Grants: Completed a 2019-2020 FAFSA at www.fafsa.ed.gov; Not enrolled as a Distance Learning student (i.e., no face to face classes) before the onset of COVID 19; Have a valid social security number; Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen; If male over age 17, be registered for U.S. Selective Service; Have a high school diploma or GED or have completed high school in an approved homeschool setting; Making satisfactory academic progress; Not have a federal or state conviction for drug possession or sale, with certain time restrictions; Not in default on a federal student loan; Enrolled at Huntingdon College for the spring 2020 semester as an active degree seeking-student; and Have a demonstrable need of funding for eligible expenses incurred as a result of disruption to College operations and related to COVID-19, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, and childcare. Method of Determining Awards Huntingdon College will use an online application process to determine which eligible students receive Emergency Financial Aid Grants and how much each student will receive. Students must apply in order to be considered for Grant funding. Applications must be completed before June 30, 2020 in order to be considered. Awarding for those who submit applications after June 30, 2020 will be based on a first come first serve basis until funds are exhausted. Individual award amounts will be no less than $100 and no more than $6,195. Students with lower EFC (Estimated Family Contribution) will be given priority. Traditional, full-time students will be given priority. Students demonstrating an intent to continue pursuit of a degree will be given priority. The amount of demonstrated eligible expenses incurred will be considered, but limited funding will most likely dictate that actual Grants received may be less than eligible expenses incurred. Once all applications have been received and reviewed, individual recipients and Grant amounts will be determined on a case-by-case basis considering the above. All Emergency Financial Aid Grants will be distributed directly to individual student recipients by check no later than July 15, 2020. Emergency Financial Aid Grants are separate and in addition to amounts refunded to students related to spring 2020 room and board charges and missed travel opportunities. Please contact the Huntingdon College Financial Aid Office if you have any questions.

Please review the 2021-2022 Professional Judgement Application below for more information on your eligibility for reevaluation of your 2021-2022 FAFSA and your next steps to request a professional judgment. If you have not done so already, please complete the 2021-2022 FAFSA questions as instructed on the application (including the transfer of 2019 tax return and income information), submit your 2021-2022 FAFSA form to the Department of Education and be sure to have Huntingdon College as a school listed on your FAFSA (ID 001019). 2021-2022 Professional Judgement Application (pdf) 2021-2022 Dependent Verification Worksheet (pdf) 2021-2022 Independent Verification Worksheet (pdf) Resources Centers for Disease Control World Health Organization National Institutes of Health What you need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\/CDC Handwashing at Home, at Play, and Out and About Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and Map This illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reveals ultrastructural morphology exhibited by coronaviruses.
