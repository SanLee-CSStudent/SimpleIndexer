The Office of Housing and Residential Life at the University of Arkansas - Fort Smith is committed to fun and engaging environments in the residence halls and student apartments. We know that the residence hall is a student\u2019s home away from home. We strive to provide residents with valuable support and resources as well as activities and programs that serve to develop a sense of community and provide opportunities for learning. Our hope is to create inclusive communities and support each student\u2019s college experience. UAFS has two living options on campus. For all students, especially our first-year students, the silver LEED-certified Lion\u2019s Den Residence Hall has more than 450 beds in suites for residents to call their own. The Lion\u2019s Den is located on the southeast corner of the campus near the intramural field and Stubblefield Center. For our upper-class, non-traditional, and married students, Sebastian Commons Apartments has more than 450 beds in full-size apartments. Sebastian Commons is located on the west edge of the campus near the Smith-Pendergraft Campus Center and the Math-Science Building. All Residential Life staff members have been carefully selected and trained to work with students to create and support living environments that are conducive to academic, personal, and social endeavors. Residents have opportunities to learn how to be good neighbors and to learn about themselves. They will learn about the differences in people, ideas, cultures, and opinions and develop friendships that will last a lifetime. Housing and Residential Life Mission Statement: The Office of Housing and Residential Life at UAFS is committed to providing safe, well-maintained, quality on-campus residential opportunities. The department promotes a spirit of community, develops programs that support student retention and success, and extends student learning beyond the classroom.
