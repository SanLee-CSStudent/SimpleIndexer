It is unlawful to use such property unless the owner agrees or you pay fees for using the property. For example, it is illegal to download or otherwise share, on a peer-to-peer basis, music and other property. The university receives many notices from organizations alleging that such activity has occurred on the UCA campus. Copyright owners, primarily recording companies, are pursuing enforcement of these laws very diligently. Many lawsuits are pending around the country seeking money damages against persons alleged to have violated the copyright laws. Compliance with all laws and the respect for another\u2019s property are important concepts in being a responsible citizen. Please make every effort to ensure that neither you nor your friends engage in such illegal activity.
