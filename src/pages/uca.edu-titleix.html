In furtherance of those values, UCA is dedicated to promoting a campus community free from discrimination. Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 requires all educational institutions to address gender-based discrimination on campus, and UCA implements these Federal requirements through a fair, consistent, and appropriate process of investigation and adjudication. In May 2020, the US Department of Education published final rules for the administration of Title IX protections on college campuses which required changes to the manner in which UCA previously responded to complaints of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct made by members of the campus community. Title IX prohibits discrimination and exclusion from participation in educational programs or activities on the basis of sex. This law, through Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights policy guidance, had been applied to require universities to develop procedures that address complaints of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct on campus. The new rules require more uniform responses from educational institutions across the nation and are now legal obligations instead of guidelines. In response to these rule changes, the UCA Board of Trustees adopted Board Policy No. 426, Title IX Sexual Harassment, in July 2020, and UCA published new Grievance Procedures in August 2020 to comply with Federal law and policy. UCA has long been committed to providing a fair and consistent process for students, faculty, and staff to report incidents of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct, and will continue to do so under these new Title IX rules. The new rules became effective on August 14, 2020. As always, members of the campus community who have experienced Title IX Sexual Harassment (including sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and the unauthorized distribution of sexual images or recordings) are encouraged to report these incidents to the Title IX Coordinator. UCA dedicates itself to academic vitality, integrity, and diversity.
