I should not be here. WE should not be here. This college should not be here, and the fact that we are here today, in the 150th year of the life of Lyon College, defies logic,\u201D said Blevins. He continued,\u201DLyon College is a survivor and a thriver, and I would like to think we, as the people of Lyon, represent the tenacity, the doggedness, the plain ol\u2019 cussed grit poured into the foundations of this place. I am convinced that we imbibe the very marrow of this school and its history, that we pack it in our suitcases when we say goodbye to Spragins and the apartments and Wilson and Rogers and head off into the world.\u201D Senior Class President Olivia Echols shared reflections from the senior class, asking students to ponder the question, \u201CWhat is the best investment you can make?\u201D Quoting Warren Buffet, Echols succinctly illustrated what it truly means to strive for one\u2019s own excellence. \u201CThe best investment you can make is an investment in yourself. If you invest in yourself, no one can take it away from you,\u201D said Echols. Perry Wilson, chairman of the Lyon College Board of Trustees, announced Associate Professor of Mathematics Dr. Tharanga Wijetunge as the recipient of the Lamar Williamson Prize for Faculty Excellence. The Board of Trustees established the Williamson Prize in 1979 in memory of Lamar Williamson. A memorial fund established by the late J.
