In order to better serve the needs of the Northeast Alabama Community, NACC and the school systems\/districts of DeKalb County, Jackson County, Fort Payne City, Scottsboro City, and Qualified Private and Home Schools have agreed to offer this opportunity to students. Students are permitted to enroll in academic and technical coursework that satisfies credit for high school graduation core requirements and high school elective credit. The Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) has determined the high school graduation equivalencies of ACCS courses that are offered through dual enrollment for dual credit. The Dual Enrollment Equivalency List can be downloaded from the ALSDE website. College courses not accepted as a graduation requirement equivalency can be counted as elective credit for the high school student. Promoting academic rigor and easing the transition to college What are some of the benefits of Dual Enrollment? Enriches course opportunities and academic rigor for high school students Avoids unnecessary duplication of course work Increases flexibility with scheduling courses at four-year schools Provides scholarship opportunities with four-year schools based upon successful completion of college courses Shortens the time to attain a college degree Saves students and parents money, since NACC\u2019s tuition is less expensive than most universities Provides students with college credit that is transferable Grades earned through dual enrollment will become part of a student\u2019s permanent high school record and collegiate transcripts Students who successfully complete a course through dual enrollment will never again wonder if they are ready to meet the challenge of college, because they will have already done so! Is Dual Enrollment right for everyone? The dual enrollment program is an opportunity to take challenging courses and accelerate education opportunities. Students who successfully complete dual enrollment courses will save time toward their college degree. Students should understand, however, that dual enrollment courses are college courses and the amount of work necessary to succeed in dual enrollment courses may be much greater than in high school courses. In addition, dual enrollment courses become a part of a student\u2019s permanent college transcript and are calculated into the student\u2019s permanent postsecondary GPA. It is important to do well in these courses to realize all the benefits of dual enrollment.
