The SpaceX CRS-16 launched its resupply mission to the International Space Station on Dec. 4 and carried four Polars and the Rapid Freezer developed by the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s engineers. This flight, combined with additional assets currently on-orbit, provided a record for UAB developed payloads on-orbit. \u201COur employees at EITD always surpass our expectations,\u201D said Lee Moradi, Ph.D., director of UAB\u2019s Engineering and Innovative Technology Development. \u201CHaving 17 payloads on the International Space Station is a testament to their hard work and dedication. This record makes UAB a significant contributor to the ISS science support.\u201D The 17 payloads include: Five Merlins: The Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator is a thermal carrier that has flown on the Space Shuttle, Northrop Grumman Cygnus and SpaceX Dragon. Merlin is a rear-breathing Middeck Locker replacement refrigerator\/incubator that provides a thermally controlled environment for scientific experiments in the ISS Express Rack, or the Visiting Vehicles. MERLIN operates between +48 ¡ÆC and -20 ¡ÆC and has been operational on the ISS since 2008. Four Glaciers: Glacier is a cryogenic refrigerator\/freezer system that provides a generic interface to accommodate multiple biological sample types and volumes that require thermal control between +4 ¡ÆC and -160 ¡ÆC. It is also capable of transporting science in the visiting vehicles at -95¡ÆC on 150W. Glacier is a double locker equivalent. Seven Polars: Polar is a powered, single Middeck locker equivalent size, +4 ¡ÆC to -80 ¡ÆC refrigerator\/freezer developed by EITD for NASA crew and Thermal Systems Division. Polar is capable of operating within SpaceX\u2019s Dragon Capsule, the Cygnus Pressurized Cargo Module and the ISS EXPRESS Rack. Polar is compatible with the 75W limitation for single lockers in Visiting Vehicles. One Rapid Freezer: Included in the 17 payloads was the newest device designed by researchers from the EITD. The device will provide a -185¡Æ C interface to enable astronauts to quickly freeze biological samples similar to the way liquid nitrogen is used on Earth. The Glovebox Freezer is portable and is capable of operation within both the Science Gloveboxes on the ISS. \u201CEITD follows UAB\u2019s strategic plan by providing high-quality, reliable, cold stowage products,\u201D Moradi said. \u201CThe EITD takes great pride in its heritage of developing complex engineering products and is thrilled to put UAB in the microgravity environment of space. UAB is well-known by NASA.\u201D back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
