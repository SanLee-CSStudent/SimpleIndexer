A new application must be submitted in the fall and the spring. Program requirements Accordion Closed Learn the criteria for course-related childcare expenses, the \u201CQualifying Childcare\u201D categories, the application process, and how to receive a voucher from our program guidelines found here. Program overview Accordion Closed In place of payments directly to childcare providers, there will be a limited number of $1,000 grants (no repayment required) for qualified participants to be applied to childcare costs. Participants will receive one $1,000 grant per semester and one grant per family. Qualified students will receive the $1,000 grant directly as a check in their name. Participants will use these funds to pay their childcare providers directly. Students may use the childcare provider of their choice as long as it falls into one of the regulated or sponsored categories of \u201CQualifying Childcare\u201D. See Program Guidelines. Students must apply for funding each term. Additional resources Students are encouraged to explore other helpful resources throughout the Flagstaff community and NAU. Some of these resources include on-campus housing, WIC, DES programs, and tribal care programs. Vouchers may be used along with other forms of childcare assistance.
