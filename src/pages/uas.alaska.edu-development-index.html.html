Giving to UAS | Office of Development & Alumni Relations Secure Online Payments Give to UAS The University of Alaska is important to Alaska\u2019s future economic development. Through partnerships with business and industry, UAS is able to focus its highest priority initiatives in response to Southeast Alaska\u2019s employment and job training needs. Statistics show that the more education an individual receives, the less money the government will spend on welfare, unemployment, child support enforcement, incarceration, health care and other social services. Furthermore, the more likely that person is to vote, be active in their community, and contribute to charities. A strong university brings more to our community than opportunities for higher education and professional advancement. Nationwide, our country\u2019s colleges and universities are centers for the arts and scientific research. These programs enrich our lives and strengthen our community, while attracting new businesses to invest in our local economy. For More Information About Giving Visit Our Donate Now Page Annual Giving At UAS alumni, friends, employees and community members can give meaningful gifts on an annual basis to the Chancellor's unrestricted fund. These funds are used for many purposes: to supplement existing named funds, or start new endowed funds as well as general scholarships, depending on the needs determined by the current Chancellor. Gifts to existing funds Contributions can be made to existing endowed or restricted funds at any time. Establishing a New Fund There are two types of funds here at UAS: endowed and restricted. Endowed A minimum of $25,000 is required to create an endowed named fund. Endowed gifts are invested. This is the most long-term, monumental form of support. For more in-depth information about this process, please see the UA Foundation, which provides administrative overview of all UAS funds Restricted A minimum of $5,000 is required to create a restricted named fund. Restricted funds smaller and not invested, but donated directly into the fund and used for the purposes defined in a gift agreement between the donor and the University. If the funds are not replenished by additional gifts, they will be closed. We\u2019d love to talk with you about your ideas for creating a new memorial fund or contributing to an existing fund.
