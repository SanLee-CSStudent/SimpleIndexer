Let us know if you prefer that your story and photos not be shared. \u201CMy experience at CAC was life changing, as I grew up in Casa Grande with limited resources; thinking a college degree was not an attainable goal. Under the excellent guidance of the late Tim Edwards and Dean Merrell, I was able to achieve success in the classroom. Having also played baseball as a Vaquero, I was able to compete at a very high level in the sport I love the most. Through the direction and mentoring of Mr. Merrell, and building upon the confidence gained at CAC, I was able to go on to Arizona State University and obtain a B.S. in Agribusiness.\u201D Shea Nieto \u201CCAC prepared me to go to the next level by attending a college where I received my bachelors degree. I am now going to use everything that I learned from the professors at CAC to achieve another milestone in my life, and that is to receive my MBA from Strayer University here in North Carolina. I am currently a small business owner. Although I did not receive a degree in business, CAC prepared me for my current career by providing me with key elements for success.\u201D Johnny Johnson, Jr. \u201CCAC was the springboard I needed to continue my education. My skills were honed at CAC giving me the tools I needed to be successful at the University. Over the past 13 years I received my BA and MA at NAU and have taught at the elementary, junior high, high school, and college levels. I was an assistant principal for a number of years. Currently I am working as the director of developmental services at Northland Pioneer College in Northern Arizona.\u201D Rickey Jackson Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn Share on Tumblr Share on Vk Share on Reddit Share by Mail learn more Alumni Events Wall of Success District Office 8470 N.
