The UCA Confidential Reporting Hotline (\u201CHotline\u201D), with the support of the UCA community, is an effective way to help the University address potential noncompliance with laws, regulations and university policies. Examples of compliance issues that may be reported using the Hotline include, but are not limited to, financial impropriety, misuse of UCA resources, conflicts of interest, discrimination, harassment, health and safety issues, and information security violations. Knowledge of the exact law, regulation or policy related to the potential violation is not necessary. In addition, certainty that a violation has occurred or will occur is not required. If uncertainty exists, the better course of action is to report the potential violation to the Hotline. The Hotline must be provided with enough information to allow the potential violation to be adequately investigated and addressed. If information exists that may be helpful to the UCA Police Department in an investigation of a crime on campus or with regard to any safety or security concerns on campus, please use the confidential reporting Hotline. However, PLEASE NOTE: If an EMERGENCY exists, a situation requires IMMEDIATE ATTENTION, or a crime is occurring, please dial 9-1-1 or (501) 450-3111 right away. The Hotline is an anonymous, toll-free, 24-hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week resource to report compliance concerns. A detailed report will be forwarded to the UCA Internal Audit office.
