We encourage you to do your research and apply for all scholarships and grants that you may be eligible for \u2013 receiving multiple awards is the best way to cover all of your college expenses. Of course, the sum of your financial aid awards cannot exceed the cost of attendance for the academic year. Federal Aid Complete your FAFSA application each year to determine eligibility for ALL federal aid programs listed below. 1. FEDERAL AID for Fall 2021, Spring 2022, and Summer 2022 classes use the 2021-2022 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You may begin submitting this application October 1, 2020 using 2019 income. Submitting your application by April 15 will ensure your file is reviewed for maximum consideration of campus-based aid and eligibility is determined prior to August. Application is available online at www.fafsa.gov. The school code for SEARK is 014893. 2. FEDERAL AID for Fall 2022, Spring 2023, and Summer 2023 classes use the 2022-2023 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You may begin submitting this application October 1, 2021 using 2020 income. Submitting your application by April 15 will ensure your file is reviewed for maximum consideration of campus-based aid and eligibility is determined prior to August. Application is available online at www.fafsa.gov. The school code for SEARK is 014893. To be considered for financial aid, students must meet the following eligibility requirements: 1) enroll in an associate degree or technical certificate program, 2) a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, 3) make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the academic program (minimum 67% completion rate of all attempted hours and a 2.00 overall GPA), 4) register for Selective Service (if applicable), 5) may not be in default on a student loan or owe a refund to any of the federal programs. Transfer students must also submit all transcripts for review. Federal financial aid is awarded with the assumption that the student is regularly admitted and will enroll full-time (12 or more hours). Federal financial aid funds are disbursed to the student each semester based on the final number of hours enrolled as of the financial aid registration deadline. Part-time students are eligible for some types of aid. The dollar amount awarded and paid to the students will depend upon the number of hours enrolled. Most Title IV financial aid programs require a minimum of half-time enrollment. Some programs require full-time enrollment. Hours taken for Audit, College Level Examinations Programs (CLEP), Department Credit, Proficiency Examination Program, or Advanced Placement are not counted when determining enrollment for financial aid purposes. Federal Pell Grant - This is the basic grant available to undergraduate students who have demonstrated an exceptional financial need on the FAFSA and have not earned a bachelor or professional degree. The award amount is reduced for students enrolled less than full-time. The 2022-2023 award amounts, based on Expected Family Contribution (EFC), range from $0 \u2013 $6,495. Certificate of Proficiency programs are not eligible programs under the Federal Pell Grant program. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) - Funds are limited and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis and are awarded with preference given to Pell Grant recipients demonstrating exceptional need. Students must be enrolled at least half-time to be eligible to receive FSEOG. The SEARK priority deadline for this grant is April 15 \u2013 as funds are available. Federal Work-Study (FWS) - enables students to earn money toward college expenses by working on campus. Students may work up to twenty hours a week while classes are in session. Students are paid bi-weekly and the rate of pay is based on the federal or state minimum wage, whichever is more. Eligible students must have financial need as determined by your FAFSA results. A separate FWS request must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office to determine eligibility. Federal Direct Stafford Loans - Student loans, unlike grants and work-study, are borrowed money that must be repaid, with interest. The Federal Direct Stafford Loan is the most common student loan program for funding undergraduate education. There are two types of Stafford loans, Subsidized and Unsubsidized. The subsidized loan is only available to students with financial need. A federal subsidy pays the interest that accrues on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time. Additional student loan options are available through the unsubsidized Stafford loan program. Regardless of financial need, a student may qualify for an unsubsidized loan. Please note: The cost to attend SEARK is currently $96 per credit hour plus fees for in-state residents enrolled in classes on campus. If enrolling in 12 hours, your tuition and fees costs are approximately $1400 with an estimated cost of $400 for books. Students are strongly encouraged to review their direct costs (tuition, fees, & books) with their financial aid award (grants, scholarships, and\/or waivers) to determine if a loan is necessary.
