JOHN R JONES, III INSTITUTIONAL PROFILE GUIDING PRINCIPLES UA SYSTEM GUIDING PRINCIPLES Dr. John Jones III During the last five years, our first strategic plan laid the groundwork for creating a 21st century model for Student Affairs, providing extraordinary student experiences and advancing student success. Additionally, we worked tirelessly to build a Division that would be the epitome of excellence and develop students into the best version of themselves. UAB Student Affairs provided students with opportunities for active learning, removed barriers to their success, and established spaces for their community engagement. We also developed experiential learning pathways and career ready competencies, constructed new safe spaces, launched university-wide health initiatives, hosted national and regional conferences, created new offices for parents and families as well as for our off-campus students and led the effort to create UAB\u2019s first-ever creed. We have accomplished a lot, and our students are better served and connected to their university. We could not have done any of it without our talented and passionate team of Student Affairs professionals. It was important to me that throughout the strategic planning process, not only each member of the Division had a voice, but actively participated in the process. As we embark upon our next five years, we will build on our strong foundation and the inspiration of our institution. Rooted in the pillars of The University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Alabama system, we created a strategic plan that will take us into the future. Developing it was a collective effort with assistance and feedback from students, colleagues and stakeholders from across the Division, UAB and the City of Birmingham. I am proud to introduce our new vision, mission and values. Using these as a guide, we developed priorities, objectives and goals as we further construct new, supportive programs, develop innovative initiatives and build curricula bridges with faculty and staff. We know that our \u201Cliving document\u201D will continue to evolve as our students develop and change. I am excited about the future and look forward to what these next five years will bring. I cannot wait to see how what we do continues to create transformational experiences for our students and our campus community. Go Blazers! Sincerely, John R.
