In addition to faculty-led projects, sophomore, junior, and senior students are encouraged to use initiative and imagination to develop their own contracted projects through the Office of Exploration Term and Contract Learning. Under the Explorations curriculum, students must pass at least two Exploration Term projects as part of their general education requirements. Each project counts as a full unit. All projects, whether graded with a letter or S\/U, count toward the requirement of two Exploration Term units. A transfer student who meets only the minimum residency requirements for a degree must pass two Exploration Term projects. All Exploration Term projects are recorded on permanent records and class schedules according to discipline abbreviations (including \u201CGEN\u201D for those projects outside of the disciplines offered at the College). If required for the major, senior Exploration Term projects will be recorded as 499. Exploration Term projects do not count toward academic area requirements under the Explorations curriculum. Exploration Term projects used to fulfill Explorations Curriculum Learning Outcomes must receive a letter grade. Have questions about E-Term?

First-Year and Transfer Students First-year students should complete online preference forms listing their top seven choices of Exploration Term projects. Students will be placed in their projects and registered by the Office of Exploration Term and Contract Learning. Meet with your advisor for registration instructions on Thursday, September, 23 2021, during Common Hour. Submit your online preference form no later than 11:59 pm, Tuesday, September 28, 2021. The Office of Exploration Term and Contract Learning will register you for the project in which you have been placed. All efforts will attempt to honor students' preferences, but due to class sizing and space restrictions, it may-- in some cases-- not be possible. Priority will be given to students who complete the preference from by the deadline listed above. Popular projects will be assigned at random. Upper-Division Students Upper-division registration for Exploration Term for seniors, juniors, and sophomores begins October 25 and ends November 3, 2020, on Self Service. Prior to Exploration Term registration, see your advisor to discuss Exploration Term projects and spring term projects. Exploration Term registration times and instructions will be provided by Academic Records in the weeks prior to registration. Internships Students may intern over Exploration Term for a minimum of 30 hours per week. Students interested in pursuing an internship for Exploration Term should start planning early and are encouraged to meet with Katy Smith, Assistant Director of Internships ( [email protected]), for assistance and guidance. Students should begin by logging into Handshake (bsc.joinhandshake.com) to book a planning appointment, review r?sum? resources, and search for opportunities. Students who wish to complete internships in Accounting; Business; Chemistry; Community & Social Change (religion\/nonprofit internships); Public Health; Pre-Law; Public History; or Student Teaching may register for the corresponding project listing found in this bulletin. Students wishing to complete internships outside of these areas should complete an Independent Study Contract. Independent Study Contracts Sophomores, juniors, and seniors who wish to engage in independent study for Exploration Term may do so through an independent study contract. Independent study projects may include student-designed service-learning projects, research projects, or internships. Any student wishing to pursue independent study should formulate a contract, working in close consultation with a faculty sponsor. Once the contract is approved by the project sponsor, the student\u2019s advisor, and the department chair, the student submits the contract to the Office of Exploration Term and Contract Learning. After contracts are reviewed, the Exploration Term and Contract Learning Committee notifies the student of any changes required for the contract to receive approval and be registered. If the contract is not approved, the student has the option to instead register for an Exploration Term project published in the bulletin. Independent study contracts should meet the academic standards of all Exploration Term projects. The student is expected to engage in 9,000 minutes (150 clock hours) of focused academic activity and to meet the terms of the study contract: follow the project\u2019s methodology as stated in the study contract, attend all required meetings with the faculty sponsor, and submit the final academic product as indicated in the contract. Contracts for independent study are due to the Office of Exploration Term and Contract Learning by Wednesday, November 3, 2021. The contract form may be found online at https:\/\/www.bsc.edu\/academics\/krulak\/Forms.html. All contracts that include activities off campus also require a release form. Additionally, all contracted internships require a signed Internship Agreement form, which may also be accessed at the above link. Students engaged in contracts for Exploration Term 2022 will be registered by the Office of Exploration Term and Contract Learning once their student contracts have been completed, received ECL faculty committee review, and any edits have been completed (if requested). Examples of completed individualized study contracts may be reviewed on the BSC Krulak Institute webpage. Senior E-Term Projects Many academic disciplines require students to complete a Senior Exploration Term Project in their major. This project is usually carried out in the senior year, but occasionally students are given permission to complete the senior project in their junior year. Students may either register for an E-Term senior project offered in their major (AC, AR, BI, ED, HS, MA, MU, PHS, PY, and THA majors only), or they may contract an independent senior project to fulfill this requirement. Travel Policy COVID-19 has once again presented unique obstacles for 2022 Exploration Term travel. All faculty-led international travel for Exploration Term has been canceled. It may be possible under certain conditions for students to individually contract a travel experience as events develop over the fall term. Students should monitor College-wide decisions regarding travel before finalizing any individualized study-travel opportunities for January. Any student traveling off campus for a credit-baring experience during Exploration Term\u2014whether for a BSC study-travel project, an independent study project, or an internship\u2014must complete and sign a release form. For students under 19 years of age, a parent or guardian must sign the release. Release forms are located on the Exploration Term\/Contract Learning section of the BSC website, under \u201CRelease Forms\u201D (http:\/\/www.bsc.edu\/academics\/krulak\/exp-con\/release-forms.html ). Since study-travel is in effect an extension of the physical campus, students studying off campus are required to conform to BSC\u2019s academic and social regulations and policies as if they were in the classroom or on the campus. BSC requires all students to conform to both US and local laws, including those pertaining to the use of alcohol, controlled substances, prescription medication, interpersonal interactions, public health measures, and public behavior. Exploration Term Projects E-Term projects are subject to change without notice. Please contact the Krulak Institute or speak to your advisor for the most up-to-date project list.

Often, these experiments are applications of general chemical principles. This project will examine the molecular interactions involved in typical procedures performed by artists such as applying a paint or pigment to paper and canvas. Scientific descriptions of color and light will be introduced in context of their use in paintings, ceramics, and prints. The atomic structure of metals, glasses, and clays will be compared to understand the physical properties desired by artists when using these materials. Mixtures such as inks and dyes will be examined to understand the role between colorant and solvent. The use of chemical technology for detecting art forgeries will also be discussed. Example laboratory sessions include dye and pigment synthesis, preparation of paints, crayons, pastels, and inks, and experiments with glass, glazes, and ceramics. Lecture sessions will include classroom discussion of assigned readings. Evaluation will consist of one formal test, a 15-page final term paper, daily written assignments, and graded laboratory sessions. Estimated Student Fees: None Distinctions or designations?
