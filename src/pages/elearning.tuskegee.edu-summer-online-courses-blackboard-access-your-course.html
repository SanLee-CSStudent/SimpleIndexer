Blackboard Access Errors (Tuesday, August 24, 2021) Good Morning Faculty In efforts to create a seamless environment, Blackboard is now part of the Single Sign-On. Some students are in the clearing stage of their acceptance to Tuskegee University and will not have access to Blackboard until they are cleared. Blackboard files update every hour. Once students are cleared and processed they can access Blackboard coursework. I understand some students are unable to access Blackboard through the single sign-on process. Faculty, I am asking for your assistance, please send an announcement to all of your student email Addresses in TigerWeb. Make sure students are using Chrome and that you put the entire email address in for the username and your email password. Before you put in your credentials select a single sign-on in the box at the bottom that says \"third-party\". It will redirect you to the TU landing page where you will enter your email credentials. Some students have had to try several times before they were accepted. Students must contact the help desk at 334-727-8040 for assistance. If you are experiencing a delay in accessing the Blackboard Collaborate sessions it could be due to your cookies. Please clear your cookies on your system. This works even if faculty are using Zoom. All technical issues are directed to the Tuskegee University help desk 334-727-8040. Everyone MUST put in a ticket for any technical service request.
