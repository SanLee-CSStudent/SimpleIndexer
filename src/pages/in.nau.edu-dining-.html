Meal plans \u2013 How They Work Meal plans are comprised of two different forms of payment: meals and Dining Dollars. Meals: are allotted either weekly or per semester and can be used in two different ways: to pay for an all-you-care-to-eat meal at a resident dining hall, or for a meal \u201Ctransfer\u201D (e.g. combo meal) at more than 20 retail dining locations across campus. Dining Dollars: work just like cash with a little-added bonus of being tax-free!
