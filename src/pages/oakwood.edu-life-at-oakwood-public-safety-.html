Harris Chief of Police OUPD Officers OUPD Supervisors Melvin Harris Chief\/Director \u2013 mharris@oakwood.edu Maurice Staples, Lieutenant \u2013 mstaples@oakwood.edu Keith Bowman, Officer \u2013 kbowman@oakwood.edu Safety Tips You can help protect yourself by taking a few precautions and following these safety tips: Trust your instincts. If a place or situation doesn\u2019t feel right, it probably isn\u2019t. Leave. Avoid shortcuts and isolated areas when walking after dark. Don\u2019t walk alone after dark. Early evening to late evening, travel only in groups of three or more in well-lit and heavily traveled areas. Call for a police escort (256.726.7375). When traveling in your vehicle, keep windows up and doors locked. If approached, don\u2019t resist a robber especially if he\/she has a weapon. Never venture into or through dark or undesirable neighborhoods. Familiarize yourself with call box locations. Don\u2019t carry large sums of cash. Get a good description of the attacker and locate a safe area in the event of an encounter. If attacked or approached by someone suspicious, contact the police immediately by calling 256.726.7911 or use the nearest call box. Student Task Force The Student Task Force gives students with an opportunity to work in a non-sworn capacity while enrolled at the Oakwood University Police Department.
