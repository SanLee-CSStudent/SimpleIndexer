Transcripts will be evaluated for transfer credit by the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office will determine the articulation of courses satisfying general education requirements and will auto-articulate credit from any institution with which ATU has a formal Memorandum of Understanding regarding transfer credit. A link is provided below to The Arkansas Course Transfer System (ACTS) equivalencies to assist you in determining articulation of general education courses taken from an Arkansas school. Your academic advisor (assigned by the department of your major) will determine which credits count toward your degree requirements and how and if those hours can be used toward your degree requirements, with final approval from the department head and dean of the college in which your major resides. Grades for transfer credit will appear on the Tech transcript as TA, TB, TC, TW, etc. Transfer grades are not calculated in your ATU cumulative grade point average. All grades may be used when reviewing admission, graduation, or aide requirements. Click here for information on transferring credit earned from a foreign\/international institution.
