Borrower Eligibility Registered full or part-time students, all faculty, and staff use their Central Arizona College ID as their library card. Pinal County residents not affiliated with CAC are eligible to fill out an application for a valid CAC Library card that can be used at all five CAC campus libraries. To register you must be at least 18 years of age and provide a current, state-issued photo ID with your current Pinal County Address. Loan Period Materials borrowed from the library must be returned or renewed by the due date. Items can be renewed up to four times. Books are checked out for a period of three weeks. DVDs circulate for 10 days. Reserve item circulation time varies, but is typically 3 hours. Most reserve items can only be used in the library. Reference material and the most current issue of journals and magazines do not circulate. Older issues of journals and magazine may be checked out. Number of Items Allowed CAC Students, Staff, Faculty and Pinal County Community Borrowers are allowed to have up to 20 items checked out at one time. Requesting Material Registered students, both full and part-time faculty, and staff borrowers are eligible to request library materials from all CAC Library branches as well as all Pinal County Public Libraries. If any material is unavailable from those sites, CAC users may request it from other libraries through Interlibrary Loan. General public users can consult their local public library branch to see if ILL is available. Charges and Refunds The borrower is responsible for fees of items declared lost, missing, damaged or overdue. Registration for the next semester may be held up until these fees are paid. Questions regarding fees can sent to library@centralaz.edu. An overdue fine of $.10\/day\/book will be assessed to the borrower starting the day after the due date, up to a maximum $5.00 fee. For reserve items, there is no set maximum fine. Items which are long overdue will be considered lost, and the full replacement cost will be billed to the borrower. Replacement costs will also be charged for items that are so damaged that they cannot be returned to the library collection. If items that are declared lost are returned within a reasonable period of time, then the library will refund the replacement fee charged, although overdue fines will still be applied. Databases Periodical databases and eBooks are available to all library patrons when accessed at one of the CAC Campus or Center locations. Off-campus access is available through Blackboard for the following groups only: Current CAC staff. Current CAC adjunct and full-time faculty. Current CAC students. Wireless Access Wireless access is available in the library at all CAC campuses. Library Use We ask patrons not to be disruptive in the library facilities and respect the rights of others to have a pleasant, clean study environment. Disruptive patrons may be asked to leave. Computer Use and Wireless Access Class-related use of the library computers takes priority over other use. Those not using a computer for class purposes may be asked to make that computer available to another student for study purposes. Please remember that the library follows Central Arizona College\u2019s Computer and Network Use Policy. Media Use Please keep in mind that while some of our viewable media (including DVDs) has public performance rights, much of it does not. If you have any questions regarding showing a film to a group, please contact the library. Faculty and staff may wish to refer to Reproduction of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians from the United States Copyright Office which also has useful information regarding the use of copyrighted material in the educational setting.
