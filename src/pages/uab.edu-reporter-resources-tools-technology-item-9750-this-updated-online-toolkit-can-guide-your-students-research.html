The updated CAS Research Sources and Skills Toolkit was created by Victoria Dawkins, first-year experience and student success librarian, in 2019 to help guide student research by better understanding how to utilize UAB Libraries\u2019 online resources. The toolkit especially came in handy during COVID, Dawkins says, as the university moved to online learning temporarily. \u201CAs the library and everyone else moved online, the toolkit was ready to help with many of our student and faculty needs relating to library instruction,\u201D she explained. One of the best features of the research toolkit, Dawkins says, is its ability to be used across all disciplines \u2014 faculty in the departments of English, Nursing, Health Services Administration, Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology, Microbiology, Biology, Immunology, Nutrition Sciences, Criminal Justice, History, and Art and Art History all are now utilizing the toolkit. The toolkit is divided into seven modules, which can be used as a supplemental tool for individual students or for faculty to use in place of or as a supplement to an in-person instructional session in UAB Libraries. Module 1: Types of Sources\/Source Code Module 2: Subject Headings and Keywords Module 3: Search Strategies (most popular) Module 4: Database-Searching Module 5: Evaluating Resources Module 6: Citation Creation Module 7: Plagiarism\/Copyright (most popular) Since the toolkit\u2019s rollout in 2019, Dawkins has worked to streamline the export process for faculty. Originally, the toolkit had to be downloaded as a .zip file and re-uploaded into Canvas by instructors; now, Dawkins can send the toolkit directly to a course\u2019s Canvas shell for faculty to modify the modules for their specific use. She also has implemented more pop-up activities and quizzes into each module, plus a fun, new feature: tour guides. \u201CRather than a disembodied voiceover, there is a \u2018person\u2019 walking each user through the toolkit,\u201D she said.
