Brown launched John Brown University to provide a Christian education to students who could not otherwise afford to attend college. Today, the Founder\u2019s commitment continues through the JBU Scholarship Fund, which is 100% dedicated to need-based financial aid and work-study employment for students. Founder\u2019s Circle members make the majority of this need-based financial aid possible. Without this help, many of our students would not be able to attend JBU. More than 300 members\u2026supporting over 700 students\u2026every year. Join the mission. Join the Founder\u2019s Circle. For more information, contact Lanya Carson at 479.524.7439 or lcarson@jbu.edu Frequently Asked Questions How will I know what to pray about? As a Founder's Circle member, you will receive a semi-annual newsletter that contains updates and prayer requests. The JBU website will also feature a page with up-to-date prayer requests for the university. How does my gift impact students? The JBU Scholarship Fund provides students with need-based and work-study scholarships while the University Fund strengthens JBU by offsetting operational costs and providing educational equipment. How do I promote JBU's mission? Look for ways to promote JBU within your circles of influence. This includes your church, school, workplace, family and friends. JBU has relied on these relationships over the years to help recruit students. When you know of a potential student, tell them about JBU, and in turn, tell JBU about the student for appropriate follow-up. How do I encourage others to support JBU? Encourage other JBU alumni and friends to get involved with the Founder's Circle or other giving opportunities. Personal testimonies often provide some of the strongest encouragement for others to give. Do I need to send my gift right away to join the Founder's Circle? You can give a one-time gift during the course of the year or you can divide your annual commitment through monthly payments, either by paying online or monthly bank draft.
