If you are new to college with no college credits and have at least a 2.6 High School GPA or higher, you need to self-report your GPA here. If you have a High School GPA of 3.0 or higher, you will be automatically placed into higher-level college courses. If you would like to place higher than your GPA allows, spend some time on the EdReady placement modules. More modules = higher scores! Official High School transcripts are required for Federal Financial Aid. If you have transfer credits from other colleges; no matter how old, make an appointment with an academic advisor first. You might have credits completed for English, Math, and\/or Reading, or you might have a pre-requisite course met; but need \"permission\" to enroll. Certain scores on the ACT\/SAT or GED can also be used for direct placement. Once you know your High School GPA, GED, SAT, ACT, EdReady, or ACCUPLACER scores, enter them into \"Placement Coach.\" This is the quickest and easiest way to see what courses you can sign up for. Make plans to meet with an Academic Advisor. Ask your Advisor to complete a Pathway Map\/Program of Study to see your journey ahead. The CLEP, GED, and Pearson Vue delivered exams will most likely start-up in February. At this time, we do not have the schedule posted, so you will need to continue checking. For CLEP, you would contact us directly. For GED, create your profile at GED.com. Register for Pearson Vue exams through specific sponsors' websites. You can always contact us via email or by phone. In the very near future, we will also offer chat as an option. The Testing Center wishes you the very best and knows you will be successful on whatever road you choose; no matter how many curves. Make it yours!! NEW - Updated Course Placement Information MCC has updated its policies for course placement.
