In an effort to ensure the safety and success of these events, the following policy shall govern the planning and implementation of all events. Any exceptions to these procedures must be approved by the Vice-President for Student Services or their designee. All Recognized Student Organization (RSO) events should be registered on CubConnect. Any event that meets the definition of a social event MUST be registered and approved. Regardless of location, events may be defined as an RSO event if: It can be easily associated with a specific RSO by a reasonable observer; Members took part in the coordination of the event for the benefit of other members of the organization and participants; or The event is sponsored by, financed by, and\/or endorsed by the organization. Events shall be categorized as either non-social or social in nature. A non-social event is defined as any function or activity that provides for the business, administrative, or educational needs of members. A social event is defined as any function or activity that is provided by an organization to meet the interpersonal or entertainment needs of members and\/or participants. Events are categorized as on or off-campus and either open or closed. On-campus: any event happening in an on-campus location. This includes all property owned by UCA, even if not on campus proper. Off-campus: any event happening off campus, whether within or outside Faulkner county. Open: Open to members of the public and UCA students\/faculty\/staff members. Closed: Participation restricted to sponsoring RSO membership times two (2) or membership of sponsoring RSOs only. If you need assistance in determining the categories for your event, please contact the Office of Student Life. A student organization may invite other special groups (non-RSO\/UCA) if approved in advance by the Office of Student Life. A student organization that sponsors any event shall, at all times, be responsible for the actions of its participants. All events will be evaluated by the Office of Student Life for approval and appropriate supplies needed. Notification of event requirements will be made upon approval of the events on CubConnect. In addition to any civil or criminal action taken by local authorities, alleged violations of this policy will be addressed through the university discipline system. The national office of the sponsoring organization may be notified. Information about off-campus events will be forwarded to appropriate law enforcement agencies. UCA reserves the right to attend and monitor any event\u2019s activities. Eligibility to hold Social Events In order to host social events, the president, two additional executive board officers, and the member responsible for planning events must attend events training. The Office of Student Life holds a training session each semester. If an organization fails to meet this requirement, all social event privileges will be revoked for that semester. Recognized Student Organizations are not permitted to host social events during Welcome Week, Study Week, or Finals Week.

RSOs must arrange security prior to registration on CubConnect. Event Monitors A student organization may be required to provide \u201Cevent monitors\u201D from its own membership to work events. It is recommended to have one event monitor per every 50 estimated participants at the event (Ex: 300 anticipated participants would mean 6 event monitors are needed.) Event monitors must attend a training program provided by UCA Police and the Office of Student Life. The number of monitors trained must be sufficient to cover the largest anticipated open event sponsored by the organization. Names and phone numbers will be required for all anticipated monitors upon registration of the event on CubConnect. Duties of event monitors include: Introduce themselves to the advisor and\/or university police officer(s) to review security procedures. Administer admission procedures established for the event. Remain sober throughout the duration of the event. Wear identifiable uniforms. Perform regular checks to ensure UCA policy is being upheld. Immediately report any infraction of school policy to on-duty police officer(s). Alcohol To Sponsor an off-campus event where alcohol will be present, the executive officers, social chair, and new member chair (if applicable) must complete an alcohol risk management program sponsored by the appropriate UCA department. This program will include information on local, state, and federal laws, as well as responsible event planning. Any event with alcohol MUST be closed. A copy of the organization\u2019s national policy on social events and alcohol related events must be on file with the Office of Student Life. Student organizations are responsible for establishing procedures to minimize the risk of alcohol related incidents and ensure that all local, state, and federal laws (and national policies, if applicable) are followed. Such procedures may include, but are not limited to: Checking IDs to ensure students are of legal age to consume alcohol Establishing an identification system (such as wristbands) to ensure alcohol is not provided to minors Providing designated drivers for individuals who are intoxicated and\/or are over the legal limit to drive Actively taking steps to minimize intoxication of individuals The Dean of Students and Office of Student Life staff reserve the right to amend this policy as needed, and will send notification upon updates.
