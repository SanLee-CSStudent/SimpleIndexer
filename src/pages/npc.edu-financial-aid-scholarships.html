There\u2019s a good chance that YOU could qualify for a Pell Grant or other financial aid at NPC. Need Money For College? Over 3 million community college students receive federal Pell Grants each year, but that\u2019s less than 20 percent of those who are eligible to receive assistance. Though the responsibility for paying for college lies with students and their families, many are able to qualify for a Pell Grant or other financial aid at NPC. Financial aid officers consider family income, the number of family members in college, and many other factors when reviewing your financial aid application. Don't assume you won't qualify! If you lack the resources to cover college costs, grants and scholarships can help make tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation, and even personal expenses affordable. Learn more about the FAFSA process in this video. Your First Step, Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)! Start by creating your own Federal Student Aid ID NOTE: Student and parent may NOT share a Federal Student Aid ID. You must have an FSA ID in order to start your FAFSA. Watch a \"how-to\" video about the 7 Easy Steps to the FAFSA. Note: The FAFSA URL has changed since this video was prepared. See below. Complete the FAFSA at https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/fafsa NPC's federal school code is 011862. Don't wait to apply! You (and parent, if applicable) must use your 2019 tax information to file the 2021-22 FAFSA application which will cover the fall 2021, spring 2022 and summer 2022 semesters. What to Expect from NPC I've completed my FAFSA. Now what? What should a student do once he or she completes their 2021-2022 FAFSA Application? Processing Time It takes 5-7 business days for the Department of Education to process and release your financial aid application (FAFSA) to NPC after you electronically sign it using your FSA ID. Once we receive your FAFSA and you have filled out an NPC Application Form, we will send you a missing information notice via your student email address. Call the NPC Financial Aid office right away to complete your file so we can process your financial aid application. After submitting ALL required documents to our office, allow 4-6 weeks for your paperwork to be processed and if eligible, your aid to be awarded. (application does not guarantee award) Once you've been awarded NPC financial aid, we will send you an award letter. Receiving Funds Financial Aid funds are released into the student's account two weeks before classes start each semester if the student completed the NPC financial aid filed by the priority deadline. Refunds are disbursed to an eligible students' selected refund preference with BankMobile after 2 p.m. the Friday after financial aid funds are released. Learn more about BankMobile refund choices. | See NPC's contract with BankMobile, a Division of Customers Bank. Students can use the eCashier payment plan to cover their tuition, fees and book costs if their financial aid is not awarded in time. eCashier payment deadlines must be met even if the student's financial aid has not been awarded. Things You Need To Know Who Can Receive Financial Aid? Required Documents Stay connected! Log into your MyNPC account regularly for important updates! Don't hesitate to call us if you have questions. An FSA ID gives you access to Federal Student Aid\u2019s online systems and can serve as your legal signature. Only create an FSA ID using your own personal information and for your own exclusive use. You are not authorized to create an FSA ID on behalf of someone else, including a family member. Misrepresentation of your identity to the federal government could result in criminal or civil penalties. If you are providing your parents' information, one parent must also apply for an FSA ID. Learn more about the FAFSA at the Federal Student Aid website, the FAFSA Help page and online videos. It is recommended that you first PRINT out the FAFSA on the Web Worksheet to help you collect and organize your information. (Parent information is only required if you are dependent.) Once you have completed the paper worksheet, then return to the FAFSA website and complete the real online application. Be sure to submit your online FAFSA application AND provide any other documents needed to the NPC Financial Aid Office by the Priority Deadline. See the \"Required Documents\" tab. NPC's Federal School Code is 011862. NPC's school year contains one fall, spring and summer semester. The FAFSA must be completed each school year on October 1. Returning students must also fill out a Renewal FAFSA on October 1. NPC also offers several institutional scholarships. To apply, students must first complete the FAFSA. NPC participates in the following federal financial aid programs as authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended: Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Arizona Leveraging Educational Assistance Program (LEAP), Federal Work Study Program (FWSP). NPC does NOT participate in any Federal Student Loan Programs, including Stafford, PLUS, Perkins and Direct Loans. FAFSA results are received in the form of a Student Aid Report (SAR). If you applied online, you should receive this in approximately one week; if you mailed in a paper FAFSA application, it will take 3-4 weeks. Keep the SAR for your records and review the information carefully. If there is a problem, follow instructions and act immediately. NPC will receive your information about the same time as you get your SAR. The submission of a financial aid application does not guarantee the award of financial aid money. You must be enrolled in an NPC-eligible degree or certificate program approved by the Department of Education. See list. You must have a high school diploma, GED or equivalent. You must be a U.S. citizen or Eligible Non-Citizen as defined by federal regulation. If you are a male student (between the ages of 18-25 and have not registered) you must be registered with Selective Service. You must not have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher. You must be in good standing and not in default of student loans and not owing a Federal Pell Grant overpayment to any college\/university. If you have any questions regarding your student loan you may log-on to Student Loans. The National Student Loan Data Systems (NSLDS) website provides information on Pell Lifetime Limits, Overpayments, Loan Status, etc. You must have resolved any drug conviction issues (applies if student was receiving aid at time of conviction). You must not be currently incarcerated. You must meet all Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements. Completing the FAFSA form is ONLY the first step! Once we receive your FAFSA and you have filled out an NPC Application Form, we will send you a missing information notice via your mailing address. You will NOT receive any funds until your entire NPC financial aid file is complete. Be sure to keep checking back with financial aid about any missing documents until you are informed that your file is complete! To complete your file you will also need to file a degree plan\/audit through an NPC Academic Adviser AND request a copy be sent to the NPC Financial Aid Office. You may also be asked for the following supporting documents: Federal Tax Return Transcripts available only from the Internal Revenue Service Notice of Non-filing status from the Internal Revenue Service W-2s, paycheck stubs, 1099s and Schedule C of the federal tax return Marriage Certificate\/Divorcee Decree for student or parent Rental\/Lease agreements, utility bill Official high school transcript\/copy of high school diploma\/GED diploma or certificate\/or official home school transcript Proof of Identity - official government photo ID (must be current) Verification About 30 percent of all FAFSA filers are selected for verification, which requires schools to collect extra documentation to check the accuracy of the FAFSA information. If selected, the verification process must be completed before financial aid can be awarded. More About Verification (if you are selected) The NPC Financial Aid office may be required to verify the following data elements on your FAFSA: Adjusted Gross Income (parent and student, if the student is dependent) Taxes paid (parent and student, if the student is dependent) Income earned from work (includes non-tax filers) Certain untaxed Income Items (parent and student, if the student is dependent) Household size Number in college (excluding parents for a dependent student) Copies of prior year IRS federal tax transcripts for both parent and student, if the student is dependent Any other inconsistent or conflicting information To verify these elements, NPC will request a specific verification form be completed. However, the list above should not be viewed as complete and other documents may also be requested based on each individual case. Important Note About Verifying Tax Information: Use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool when completing your FAFSA, which allows you to link to the IRS from the FAFSA and retrieve your tax information directly into the FAFSA tax return questions. Using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool simplifies FAFSA filing and may result in quicker processing for verification. NPC can no longer accept copies of your federal tax return for the verification process. You must either use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool or you will be required to obtain a tax transcript from the IRS.
