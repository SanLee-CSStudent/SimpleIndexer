Blazer Kitchen Stats Patient Outreach In collaboration with UAB Medicine, Blazer Kitchen will have a measured expansion to support patients in select clinics. Patients are referred to the pantry by medical professionals and onsite social workers who recognize symptoms of food insecurity or when a patient screens positive for food insecurity. Currently, Blazer Kitchen provides food to the following UAB patient groups: Comprehensive Cancer Center \u2013 When available, protein shakes are provided to patient navigators for distribution to patients with cancer. Cystic Fibrosis Clinic \u2013 After screening positive for food insecurity, patients are provided a bag of food to meet their unique dietary needs. Geriatrics Clinic \u2013 After screening positive for food insecurity, seniors are provided bag of food dense with protein since studies show many senior citizens do not receive enough protein. Seniors are also referred to the Benefits Enrollment Center and food pantries within their own communities. In partnership with the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama to End Senior Hunger, Blazer Kitchen volunteers assist with packing food bags to increase the amount of food that can be provided.
