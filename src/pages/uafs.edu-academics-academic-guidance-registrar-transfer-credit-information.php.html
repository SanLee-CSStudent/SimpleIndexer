Transfer credit will be evaluated according to the Arkansas Course Transfer System (ACTS). ACTS contains information about the transferability of courses within Arkansas public colleges and universities. You are guaranteed the transfer of applicable credits and the equitable treatment in the application of credits for the admissions and degree requirements. Course transferability is not guaranteed for courses listed in ACTS as \u201CNo Comparable Course.\u201D Transfer credit is subject to a two-stage evaluation process. First, the Registrar\u2019s Office will complete an initial evaluation of the transfer credit for the institution. Second, the department responsible for the course will evaluate the transfer credits that will satisfy degree program requirements. Credits found to be eligible for general transfer may not always apply to a specific degree program. You should be prepared to submit a course syllabus in case a course(s) require further evaluation. Credits that do not transfer to UAFS: Courses in which a grade of C or higher has not been earned. (See the Undergraduate Catalog for exception.) Some remedial coursework; placement testing may be required. Credit waived by an institution by test scores or credit earned by institutional exam. Institutions that are not regionally accredited. National accreditation is generally not accepted. Grades earned at other institutions are not calculated in the student\u2019s GPA earned at the university. Colleges within the university will review grades for admission into specific programs. Grades earned at other institutions are used in the calculation of university graduation honors. When a course is taken at another institution and is repeated, whether at the other institution or UAFS, the highest grade is included for graduation purposes. In either case the grade received at UAFS is included in the student\u2019s GPA. The maximum number of hours transferable to a baccalaureate degree is 68 semester hours of lower-level (1000-2000) coursework. The only exceptions are the Bachelor of Applied Science and Bachelor of Science in organizational leadership; contact the department head of both programs for more information. The number of upper-division transferable coursework will vary by college and program. Transfer credit is posted at the level at which it is earned. The Roger Phillips Transfer Policy Act of 2009 provides for the seamless transfer of lower-level credits for those students who have completed an Associate of Arts (A.A.), Associate of Arts in Teaching (A.A.T.), or Associate of Science (A.S.) at an Arkansas public institution of higher education and transfer to a baccalaureate degree program at a four-year institution. Accordingly, UAFS will accept into junior status any student who has completed an A.A., A.A.T., or A.S. Additional lower-level general education courses cannot be required for a transfer student with a completed A.A., A.S., or A.T. unless the course(s) meets one of the following exceptions: The course(s) is required of the student\u2019s major. The course(s) is a prerequisite for a course required of the student\u2019s major. The course(s) is required by an accrediting and\/or licensure body. The student earned a grade of D or F in the transfer course. The State Minimum Core Act 98 of 1989 requires each institution of higher learning in Arkansas to identify a minimum core of general education courses that shall be fully transferable between state-supported institutions. The required 35 hours of credit will transfer and apply toward the degree. Transfer Credit GuideArticulated CoursesMilitary & Foreign Transcript Credit Transfer Credit Guide The Transfer Credit Guide allows you to see which courses could transfer from other institutions to UAFS. It is intended only to provide you with an evaluation tool to review potential transfer of credit and does not denote an official transfer of credit. The information displayed in the platform is subject to revision, without prior notice, as a result of changes in either UAFS's or the originating institution's curriculum. The official evaluation of transfer credit occurs only when the student applies for admission to UAFS . You must have a completed application on file and submit official transcript(s) from all schools attended for an official course evaluation. For information about a course not listed, contact Transfer@uafs.edu. The Transfer Credit Guide is not a complete list of all transferable coursework. The guide is continually updated as new courses are reviewed. Please note that, although a course transfers, it may not apply toward degree requirements for your major. Requirements will be determined by the college that manages your degree and major. To use the Transfer Credit Guide, first select the state in which your institution is located and then the name of the originative institution. You will then be provided with a chart that provides the title of the course from your originating institution and its equivalent course at UAFS. You must then select the grade you received in the course by clicking on the \"None\" option under the grade box and selecting \"Add to My List.\" Once you have selected all courses, select the \"View My List\" option to see the number of credit hours that will potentially transfer to the UAFS. Transfer Credit Guide The Transfer Credit Guide is an unofficial tool and should be used in consultation with your academic advisor. Articulated Courses UAFS credit hours are semester units of credit. Only courses with a grade of C or better can transfer. \u201CUAFS\u201D as the course subject indicates UAFS does not have an equivalent subject. \u201CXXX\u201D in a course number indicates the course is not equivalent to a UAFS course or requires further evaluation by the college under which the course falls. You should work with your advisor to determine if it can be used to substitute for courses in the your degree. \u201CGEN\u201D within a course number indicates that, although there is not a UAFS equivalent, the course may be applied toward a general education core requirement. The following area designations will follow the course title: EN = English\/Communications FA = Fine Arts HG = American History\/Government HU = Humanities LS = Lab Science SP = Speech SS = Social Science Credit hours Military Credit Military credit will be evaluated by the individual college of your major. Your advisor will determine if military credits will apply toward your degree and submit appropriate course substitution(s). Credits are posted after final approval. Credit will be evaluated as general transfer hours and limited credit will apply for academic course credit. You may be awarded a maximum of 30 credit hours. Military transcripts for active duty personnel and veterans of the Army, Coast Guard, Marines, and Navy can request transcripts via the Joint Services Transcript (JST). Transcripts for active duty personnel and veterans of the Air Force can be obtained through the Community College of the Air Force. Foreign Transcript Credit Students seeking to transfer credit from a foreign institution must submit a credential evaluation through a service that is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES). A credential evaluation service is to used verify the authenticity of credits and for conversion of units of credit to semester credit equivalency. The service provides course titles but not course descriptions which are required for courses to be evaluated. Therefore, in addition to requesting a report from a transcript credential service, course descriptions in English must be provided for credits to be evaluated. 5210 Grand Avenue | P.O.
