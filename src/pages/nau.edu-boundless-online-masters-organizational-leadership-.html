Jessica Stuart has no patience for inequality. After all, she\u2019s experienced more than her fair share in her lifetime. Enough to know that her career path will be dedicated to protecting others from discrimination. A Marine veteran, Stuart is working toward a master\u2019s degree in Organizational Leadership through NAU Online in preparation for a career as a diversity officer. Stuart was a Marine from 2007 until 2012. She worked as an avionics technician in Miramar, San Diego, where she met and married her Marine husband. They moved to Yuma, Arizona in 2012, but with her husband now on the cusp of retirement, they\u2019re looking at moving to Texas to be closer to family. Stuart has an associate degree in exercise and wellness and a personal training certification. She earned her bachelor\u2019s in Allied Health from NAU\u2013Yuma. As a civilian, she held a job where she was the only woman on a crew of more than 40. Misogyny, in forms large and small, was a daily occurrence. That experience was the catalyst for her decision to pursue a master\u2019s degree. \u201CI have more gray hair from that job than from when my daughter was two years old,\u201D she jokes. With guidance from Cecilia Torres in the NAU Veteran Success Center, she found the Organizational Leadership program and applied. Her daughter is now 10, and she has a stepson who is 13. The fully online program gives her the flexibility she needs for her family, whether they stay in Yuma, move to Texas, or go somewhere else. Her coursework revealed career options that aligned with her passion for equality. \u201CThis class on diversity showed me that that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201D she says. \u201CWe were talking in this class about the increase of women getting their education over the past three decades. Amazingly, corporate America is only 20 percent female leadership; it\u2019s mind-blowing. More women are getting their degrees than men. But the inequity is still institutionalized.\u201D She wants her children to grow up in a more equitable and ethical society. \u201CI\u2019m all about equality and just being treated as equals. Women have a lot of experience. Try us out as leaders.\u201D She recalls a job interview she had shortly after moving to Yuma. The interviewer wanted to know if she was afraid of spiders. The other finalist, a man with exactly the same experience and qualifications, didn\u2019t get that question and was chosen for the job. \u201CThat\u2019s the stuff that I want to eliminate,\u201D she says. Her goal after graduation is to get a job where she is in a position to weed out that kind of baked-in inequality\u2014for women, for veterans, for the disabled, for everyone. \u201CI\u2019m all about that little guy needing their voice heard.\u201D Stuart is enjoying her coursework and her experience with NAU Online. She plans to graduate in late 2022. \u201CThe content and the classes are great,\u201D she says. \u201CI like NAU. It\u2019s a great university to go to. I\u2019m always telling my husband\u2019s Marines, \u2018You need to get your degree. You need to use your tuition assistance. Go to NAU because it is more affordable, and you\u2019re getting a great education.\u2019 I like NAU a lot.\u201D SHARE YOUR STORY What goals have you crushed?
