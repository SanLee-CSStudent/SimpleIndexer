The mission of the Program, like that of the college, is to provide accessible quality educational opportunities, promote economic growth, and enhance the quality of life for the people of Alabama. The Criminal Justice Program is driven to engender intellectual engagement with the students through instruction, research, application and the promotion of public service so that it correlates with the aforementioned mission statement. In furtherance of the college\u2019s mission, the Program provides a student-centered curriculum that focuses on the needs of a diverse student population. The Program offers pathways for students pursuing careers in law enforcement, courts and corrections, and security. The Program has a range of courses, allowing students to explore concepts in criminal law; police procedures; corrections and security; the American judicial system; and criminology. Our program strives to offer education that will reflect the standards of business and industry specific to the criminal justice. We place emphasis on goals that assist students in their desire to achieve higher education and who wish to be productive members of the workforce. The program provides quality advising to help students maximize their potential of achieving their career and educational goals. We engage in partnerships with criminal justice agencies to offer resources, networking and establish possibilities of internships and employment. Through advisement, the Program will guide students toward goals of achieving their certificate of criminal justice, certificate in law enforcement, an AS or an AAS criminal justice degree. The Program also oversees the Northeast Alabama Community College\u2019s Criminal Justice Institute for Applied Forensics. The lab is a partnership between Northeast Alabama Community College and DeKalb District Attorney Mike O\u2019Dell, as well as the Jackson County District Attorney and law enforcement agencies in DeKalb and Jackson counties. The lab will allow law enforcement to test seized drug samples at a neutral site with test conducted by independent analysts. These analysts are employed by the college, they are not in law enforcement; and the lab is operated as an independent testing lab. It is an option for investigations to obtain analysis of a sample which will allow a faster turnaround time for identification. This gives the ability to offer a pretrial motion to expedite cases that might otherwise be backlogged. The lab can also be utilized for educational purposes for student observation. It is with pride that we strive to better serve students, the communities we serve, our college and the criminal justice system. Goals and objectives: To continuously work toward fulfilling the academic mission of the college. To provide students with courses and programs of high quality that will assist them in understanding diversity of disciplines and topics all-inclusive to criminal justice. To provide students with knowledge, skills and engagement that will assist advancement in criminal justice professions, related fields, or in the continuation of criminal justice studies. To better prepare the future workforce by offering the continuation of education that will offer paradigmatic learning of business and industry standards, and focusing on additional skills that will develop employable job candidates.
