The campaign, called \u201CJourney to Distinction,\u201D is dedicated to telling the stories of Christian college students with the goal of sharing what God is doing in the lives of young men and women at Christian colleges and universities and how their college experiences prepared them to succeed beyond graduation. Morgan Champion \u201921 and Justin Stuckey, a senior, were both featured. Stuckey, who will graduate in late April, is a two-time All-American and competes in the high jump. He also made his first Olympic trials appearance last June. Stuckey says being a member of the men\u2019s track and field team at Samford is something he never expected to do but is an experience he is his grateful for. \u201CI didn\u2019t expect to do track ever in college. I didn\u2019t have track dreams,\u201D Stuckey said. \u201CThe blessing and opportunity to have Christ incorporated into our daily walk\u2014understanding that when He opens a door, you have to go through it. Don\u2019t try to close a door that He opens.\u201D Attending a Christian university has led Stuckey to leadership opportunities beyond the track and field. \u201CIt wasn\u2019t just about being here for track. I joined a ministry group on campus during my sophomore year. I\u2019ve also been looked at as a guy people look up to, but I didn\u2019t think I was somebody that others would want to help lead them closer to God,\u201D Stuckey said. He also says meeting other students from various backgrounds and cultures has enriched his experience. Champion, who was born with cerebral palsy, was nervous about how she would be received by others in college due to her disability, but upon arrival to Samford, she knew she had found a home. \u201CThe acceptance and the love and the empathy that you get here, I was never the girl in the chair. I was always Morgan and I was pushed to be the best that I could be in the most loving and caring way possible,\u201D Champion said. \u201CChristian colleges truly do mean being surrounded by good people who know you and who care about what you can bring to the world.\u201D Champion, who graduated from Samford with a degree in religion and is now a Master of Divinity student at Samford's Beeson Divinity School, says her journey in Christian higher education has only strengthened her faith. \u201CMy identity as a disabled person has been impacted so much through my college experience and it\u2019s because of the support I\u2019ve had here and the provision of the Lord,\u201D Champion said. \u201CNo matter who you are or where you come from, you are going to find the support here and you are going to be encouraged to put your light into the world.\u201D \u201CIt is an honor to share our students\u2019 experiences and highlight how attending a Christ-centered university has helped them learn, grow and succeed,\u201D said Betsy Holloway, vice president of marketing and communication at Samford University. \u201CThe relationships and bonds formed between students and faculty at Samford is a special and unique aspect of Christian higher education. We are thrilled to be part of the CCCU\u2019s \u2018Journey to Distinction\u2019 campaign and help emphasize the benefits of attending a Christ-centered university.\u201D The Journey to Distinction campaign was developed by a group of communication and enrollment leaders at CCCU member institutions across Christian higher education. Launched in March, the initiative features 10 videos and a campaign website highlighting student stories of faith-integrated learning and living. These stories will be shared globally, through social media, broadcast and print media. To view more videos and read about other students\u2019 experiences, visit the Journey to Distinction website.
