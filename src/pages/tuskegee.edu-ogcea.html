General Counsel OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS General Counsel and Vice President for External Affairs Tuskegee University\u2019s Office of the General Counsel and Vice President for External Affairs provides legal advice and related services to the university, as well as represents the university in collaboration with the Office of Advancement and Development in matters relating to legislative and governmental relations. OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL The office\u2019s legal responsibilities include interpreting state and federal laws, formulating and issuing legal opinions, reviewing and\/or drafting legal documents such as contracts, and assisting with the formulation of policies. It strives to provide the highest-quality legal services in a responsible, helpful and timely manner; protect and promote the university\u2019s values and interests (including compliance with its obligations); minimize legal risks and costs; and address and resolve legal disputes. Its team collaborates directly with the Board of Trustees, the president, the provost, and university administrators, as well as other designated administrative officers, faculty and staff in their official capacities and to accomplish their institutional objectives. In addition, the office works closely with other campus departments to ensure the university's compliance with laws, policies and procedures, and to foster sound decision-making in all areas of operation, instruction, research and administration. The General Counsel\u2019s Office provides legal services and opinions related only to official university business. Its staff cannot advise persons who may have a claim against the university or one of its employees, nor can it provide personal legal services to faculty, staff or students. Individuals with such a need should always consult with appropriate outside counsel on legal issues. The board, president and other designated officials may request legal assistance for institutional issues directly from our office. Other employees, offices, departments and university entities should route their requests through the appropriate administrative reporting line and to the appropriate vice president or provost. Disclamer: Legal resources on our website provide useful information and direction to accommodate those engaged in official university matters, but should not be interpreted as \"legal advice\" from the Office of General Counsel. The materials provided on this website are for informational purposes only. Unless otherwise indicated, this information does not change or affect any policy, rule or regulation of Tuskegee University. EXTERNAL AFFAIRS In collaboration with the university\u2019s Office of Advancement and Development, the office cultivates and manages the university\u2019s relationships with state legislators, federal legislators and other elected officials, as well as local, state and federal governmental agencies that benefit from or partner with the university. The office also monitors local, county, state, regional and federal legislation, executive orders, regulatory policies, agency directives and court rulings that may affect the university. Through the work of the external relations team, the university can expect to expand its public profile among and external funding from local, state and federal partners.
