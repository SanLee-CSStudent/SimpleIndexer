It helped me really see what Career Services has to offer me, and I regret not using their resources when I first entered college as a freshman.\u201D \u201CThe Merit Fellow program helped to polish my interview skills and gave valuable feedback on my resume that helped me to land a full time job before I graduated. Going to the career fairs exposed me to different opportunities that I did not know existed for people with a journalism major.\u201D \u201CThe merit class of fall 2017 was super organized, and I loved the various options for events because as college students we are involved with many other organizations that require our time as well.\u201D \u201CIt was a great way to get involved, and I learned a lot through it! I am glad there are programs on campus like this one that are free and really give you a lot of information.\u201D \u201CThank you for this whole process! I feel that going through this has helped me to build my networking skills.\u201D Career Services Bernard Hall Room 311 201 Donaghey Avenue Conway, AR 72035 Phone: (501) 450-3250 Fax: (501) 852-2330 E-mail: bears4hire@uca.edu Stay Connected ? ? ? ? ? ?
