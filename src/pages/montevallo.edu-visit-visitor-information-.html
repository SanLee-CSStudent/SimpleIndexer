Visitors are welcome to stroll the quads, admire the architecture, and even have a meal in the cafeteria or one of the other food service locations on campus. The central portion of the campus is a National Historic District, and there are more than 25 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places including three antebellum structures. The central portion of the grounds was designed by the Olmsted Brothers, the same landscape architecture firm that designed New York\u2019s Central Park and the grounds of the Biltmore Estate near Asheville, N.C. If you are a prospective student, a campus visit may be the single most influential part of the college decision-making process. It\u2019s your opportunity to see a classroom or a room in one of our residence halls, speak with current UM students and professors, and ask questions about life at Montevallo.
