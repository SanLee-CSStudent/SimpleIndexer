News Tuskegee University President to Speak at the Lincoln Memorial 100th Anniversary May 09, 2022 Contact: Kawana McGough, Office of Communications, Public Relations and Marketing Tuskegee University president, Dr. Charlotte P. Morris, will deliver the keynote address during the 100th Anniversary dedication at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on May 22, 2022. The Memorial was dedicated in 1922 to the memory of Abraham Lincoln, who preserved the Union. Since then, the monument has become associated with the advancement of civil rights and equality. \"I am honored to continue Tuskegee's legacy of speaking at the Lincoln Memorial's dedication,\" said President Charlotte P. Morris. \"Tuskegee plays a central role as a thought leader and advocate for civil and human rights, social justice, and economic empowerment, and I am proud to honor this historical tradition.\" The original dedication ceremony featured an address by Tuskegee's second president, Dr. Robert Moton. Dr. Moton spoke about Lincoln's role in addressing the two legacies of America's founding, liberty, and bondage. Dr. Moton addressed a segregated audience, and his remarks were censored by the event convener, Chief Justice Howard Taft. On May 30, 2009, Tuskegee University President Benjamin F. Payton delivered the principal address during the rededication of the Lincoln Memorial. Standing in the shadows of American history, Payton brought Abraham Lincoln's legacy to light and spoke to America's pride, struggle, and journey towards equality, justice, and full democracy. Morris, the ninth and second female president of historic Tuskegee University, is expected to speak at about 10:00 a.m. on Sunday, May 22, during a rededication ceremony sponsored by The Lincoln Group of the District of Columbia in conjunction with the U. S. National Park Service. The Memorial, which millions of tourists visit annually, was constructed on the National Mall to honor Lincoln, the 16th U.S. president. Under the theme of \"Lincoln's Vision of Unity and Equality,\" this rededication aims to capture a broader view of what the Memorial has come to represent. Alumni and friends are invited to be part of history by joining Dr. Morris and the Tuskegee family on Sunday, May 22, at 10 a.m. RSVP for the Tuskegee University reserved section at the Lincoln Memorial dedication. Seats are limited and are on a first-come, first-serve basis. Once the Tuskegee reserved section is filled, you can still RSVP to attend by visiting: https:\/\/www.lincolnian.org\/event-details\/lincoln-memorial-centennial-day Click here to learn more about Tuskegee University's History at the Lincoln Memorial. ? 2022 Tuskegee University ?
