Nearly 200 collegiate bass fishing teams from across the nation competed in the Bass Pro Shops 2022 BoatUS Collegiate Bass Fishing Championship tournament at Pickwick Lake in Florence, Alabama on May 26-27, but only one was named School of the Year for having amassed the most cumulative points of any team in the nation. Last year, the fishing team, which is part of the UM President\u2019s Outdoor Scholars Program, earned the same achievement. Montevallo became just the third school to win back-to-back School of the Year honors in the history of the sport. \u201CThere are only two other programs that have won this title twice,\u201D said UM Head Fishing Coach William Crawford. \u201CTo be able to do that again is a real honor and shows the hard work that our guys have put forth this year.\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s hard to get a repeat title because everybody is gunning for you. We stepped up to the challenge and had another good year. It speaks to the team\u2019s work ethic and commitment to be able to bring another national title home to the University of Montevallo.\u201D Dr. John W. Stewart, president of the University, said he\u2019s proud of the team for making Montevallo\u2019s fishing team prominent nationally. \u201CThe skill, industry and passion they invest in their sport is truly impressive,\u201D he said. \u201CWilliam Crawford and Scooter Stano are to be commended for their vision and leadership of our Outdoor Scholars Program at Montevallo. Congratulations to these student champions.\u201D The tournament was hosted at Pickwick Lake in Florence, Alabama, and was presented by Abu Garcia. The 2021-2022 team members are listed below.
