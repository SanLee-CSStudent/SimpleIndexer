Dr. Jason Heaton joined the Department of Biology in 2010, following teaching positions at UAB, Samford University, and Indiana University. He earned undergraduate degrees in biology and anthropology before receiving his master\u2019s degree and Ph.D. in anthropology from Indiana University. He has conducted archaeological and paleontological research in South Africa since 2000, and he has worked as a part of the Swartkrans Palaeoanthropological Research Project (SPRP) since 2005. This work has led to groundbreaking research, including a recent study of an early human skeleton, Little Foot. Dr. George Klersey first joined the Department of Business Programs in 1995 as the EBSCO Professor of Accounting, before leaving in 2007. He returned to BSC in 2013 following positions at the University of Colorado, Denver and Piedmont College.

Dr. Clyde Stanton joined the Department of Chemistry in 1993, following post-doctoral research appointments at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Silver Spring, Maryland, the Naval Research Library in Washington, D.C., and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry from Clemson University, his master\u2019s degree in chemistry from West Virginia University, and his Ph.D. in chemistry from Boston College. Stanton\u2019s research expertise includes spectroscopic properties of small molecular species, laser-based techniques to investigate chemical reactions, and molecular modeling of chemical properties and reactions. Dr. David Ullrich joined the Department of English in 1985 following positions at Ripon College and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s degree from Marquette University and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
