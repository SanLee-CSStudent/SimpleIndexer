As readers, they become good analysts of style and content, character and theme, and they develop their own responses to whatever they read\u2014whether they are reading Shakespeare\u2019s Othello or a corporate annual report. As writers, they become masters of the principal tool of thought\u2014language\u2014sometimes becoming published writers before they graduate. This mastery of the written word\u2014both as a critical and insightful reader and as an adept and creative writer\u2014provides an excellent foundation for a wide range of professions and for a fulfilling life of continued learning. % of English majors are employed or in grad school within 6 months of graduation % of those who graduate, do so in 4 years or less Meet the Faculty Details Courses Careers Admissions Internships Scholarships Why choose the English program at Lyon College?
