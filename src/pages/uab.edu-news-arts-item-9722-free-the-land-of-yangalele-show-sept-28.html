Siama performed with many of the greats and was a sought-after studio musician, recording hundreds of popular songs during the golden era of soukous music in the 1970s and \u201980s, according to his artist\u2019s statement. His signature sound and commitment to innovation helped to fuel the popularization of soukous (aka \u201Cthe sound of happiness\u201D), which is ubiquitous on dance floors the world over to this day. Siama launched his solo career in 2014 from Minneapolis after being awarded a McKnight Fellowship. Now that he is running his own show, he has developed an acoustic format, a lot of new material is flowing, and he is collaborating with musicians of a wide array of backgrounds and instrumentation. In addition to performing concerts, festivals, home concerts and special events, Siama hosts interactive programs and instrument petting zoos for children and lifelong learners, and he teaches workshops on songwriting and guitar.
