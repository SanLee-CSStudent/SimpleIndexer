Program Give UNCF Golf Select Page Research presentations by various Faculty Research & Grants Blessings & Breakthroughs: Highlights of the October 2021 Board Meeting The Office of Research and Grants exists to stimulate and nurture a culture of scholarly inquiry and provide opportunities for professional development and pedagogical improvement. \u201CEvery human being, created in the image of God, is endowed with a power akin to that of the creator-individually, power to think and to do. The men in whom this power is developed are the men who bear responsibilities, who are leaders in enterprise, and who influence character.\u201D -Education (pg. 17.2) The culture of scholarly inquiry continues to be built throughout the Oakwood University community every year through the continuation of the Faculty Development Grant Program, additional research partnerships, and the fruition of grants as a result of current research partnerships. We look forward to assisting our faculty, [staff and students] with their research and grant endeavors.
