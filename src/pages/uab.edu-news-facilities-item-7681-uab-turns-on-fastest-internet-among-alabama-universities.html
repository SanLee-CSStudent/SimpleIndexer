As the year draws to a close, UAB News looks back at some of the top stories of 2016. See them all here. \u201CModern students and faculty members need access to digital connectivity that supports their maximum potential in and out of the classroom.\u201DThe University of Alabama at Birmingham is the first university in the state to launch internet speeds of 100 gigabits per second, boosting available bandwidth by 10 times the previous capability and up to 10,000 times many standard home internet speeds. The $2.5 million investment is a valuable addition to the UAB experience for students, faculty, staff, guests and partners, providing the UAB community a competitive advantage in education, research, innovation and entrepreneurship, and patient care. \u201CUAB has world-class faculty, researchers and students intent on changing the world,\u201D said Vice President for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer Curt Carver. \u201CHundred-gigabit speeds are not just about the flow of information and data into the university. This is ultimately about collaborating worldwide and the creation of novel ideas, new approaches and UAB\u2019s delivering innovation. To change the world, you have to be deeply connected to it.\u201D Provost Linda Lucas says staying at the forefront of digital connectivity is vital in a university environment. \u201CModern students and faculty members need access to digital connectivity that supports their maximum potential in and out of the classroom,\u201D Lucas said. \u201CThe continued advancements outlined in IT\u2019s strategic plan have established and will maintain the competitive advantage we offer in education and research.\u201D David Crossman, Ph.D., director of Bioinformatics in the UAB Heflin Center for Genomic Science Core Laboratories, says this upgrade is significant for researchers, clinicians and patients. Recently, it took UAB faculty more than a month to process and analyze a genomics package. With UAB\u2019s new capabilities, those same results are possible in a matter of days. \"This is ultimately about collaborating worldwide and the creation of novel ideas, new approaches and UAB\u2019s delivering innovation. To change the world, you have to be deeply connected to it.\u201D \u201CFor a patient waiting to find out if he or she has a genetic disorder, three to four weeks is an eternity,\u201D Crossman said. \u201CAccess to this kind of bandwidth and computing power will accelerate patient care as well as research that leads to new treatments and cures.\u201D Crossman compares former speeds used to transfer genomic packages to a drinking straw. \u201CThe 100 meg speeds we used to have were like a straw,\u201D he said. \u201CThen we upgraded to 1 gig, which seemed more like a garden hose. Going to 10 gigs felt like we upgraded to a firehose. Now, with 100 gigs, we have a water main. We can deliver results exponentially faster.\u201D To lower costs and enhance network resiliency, UAB partners with the University of Alabama and University of Alabama at Huntsville to operate the University of Alabama System Regional Optical Network. Through this network, UAB lights up two 100 gbps fiber wavelengths \u2014 one from Atlanta and one from Nashville \u2014 providing important redundancy. The concepts of partnership, stewardship and redundancy permeate this new network design, Carver says. \u201CIf one line goes down, the UAB community won\u2019t notice it because our system will switch seamlessly to the other,\u201D he said. \u201CThe work being done by UAB students, faculty and hospital employees is too important to lose connectivity when a backhoe or car hits a line between here and Atlanta.\u201D These upgrades are the latest in a series of investments supporting the strategic plan for IT. In September, UAB unveiled the most advanced supercomputer in the state, significantly enhancing research capabilities across campus. The addition of 100 gbps of connectivity further differentiates UAB from other research institutions in the state, region and country. UAB is also now the only Alabama university with an Akamai switch. Akamai is the standard for internet caching all over the world, with 135,000 servers deployed in 2,200 locations. The Akamai switch brings internet content locally to the UAB campus for much faster access by users all while preserving valuable internet capacity. To put the significance of UAB\u2019s having an Akamai switch in perspective, there are only two Akamai switches in the state of Alabama. Early in UAB\u2019s strategic planning process, UAB President Ray L. Watts established investments in the IT infrastructure as a key priority. \u201CDr. Carver and his team have taken a holistic approach to support major strategic priorities as well as each individual on campus,\u201D Watts said. \u201CAnd as we grow, we will leverage our infrastructure to benefit broader innovation in Birmingham so our institution and city continue to grow together.\u201D Read more about how investments in UAB\u2019s IT infrastructure are benefiting research. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
