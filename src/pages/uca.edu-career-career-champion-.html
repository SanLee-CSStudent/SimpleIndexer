Faculty Career Champions 2022 Mrs. Rebecca Gray School of Nursing \u201CMrs. Gray helped me connect to UCA Career Services to find a full-time job, as she built her course around professional development. She encouraged us to go to resume reviews, mock interviews and cover letter writing workshops. She also told us about the WOW Closet and other services they offer. She invited several staff members from career services to speak with our cohort in order to prepare us for future interviews and job searches. I can personally say her advising me to connect career services for my resume helped me land a job.\u201D \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 2021 Mr. Steve Ward Teaching and Learning \u201CMr. Ward was the reason, after dropping out of school, that I began again, took the necessary coursework and program that he described for me. He is determined and optimistic and it wouldn\u2019t be possible to be starting a career as a teacher without his advice and encouragement.\u201D \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 2020 Mrs. Monica Lieblong Family & Consumer Science \u201C[Monica] opened my eyes to possible career opportunities within the community and the difference that a career in Family and Consumer Science can make on an individual level. Because of her, I am now volunteering in the community and making a difference! She taught me how to dress for an interview and how to construct a professional email. She gave me information that I can only use now but in the future\u2026.\u201D 2019 Dr. Kimberly Little History \u201C[Dr. Little] helped me pinpoint what kind of work I want to do in a museum by quizzing me on my school experience and personal preferences. She worked extremely hard editing my resume to make sure I got an internship doing exactly what I want to do in the future; that internship confirmed that I have chosen the right career and gave me my only professional experience. She brought the hiring official of Arkansas State Parks to campus to discuss internships and how it can lead to career opportunities\u2026.\u201D Career Services Bernard Hall Room 311 201 Donaghey Avenue Conway, AR 72035 Phone: (501) 450-3250 Fax: (501) 852-2330 E-mail: bears4hire@uca.edu Stay Connected ? ? ? ? ? ?
