Among public universities, the college was ranked No. 5, ahead of the University of California-Berkeley, the University of Texas-Austin and the University of Virginia. As one of the few colleges of education in the country that excels at both teacher preparation and world-class scholarly research, MLFTC consistently ranks first in education-related funded research. ASU reported a total of $73.5 million in funded research related to education, earning it the No. 1 spot in the survey. Download Full Image With 4,833 students enrolled in graduate programs in 2021, the college reported the largest enrollment among all universities ranked. \u201CRankings don't tell the whole story,\u201D said Carole Basile, dean of Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. \u201CBut they do tell a story. If a school consistently knocks on the door of the U.S. News top 10 while explicitly rejecting the culture of selectivity and exclusion that has so distorted higher ed, it's probably doing something right. And it's probably doing the things that matter most right.\u201D The rankings identified the following graduate specialty programs as among the top in the nation: No. 11 \u2013 Best Master\u2019s in Curriculum and Instruction Programs. No. 12 \u2013 Best Master\u2019s in Elementary Education Programs. No. 12 \u2013 Best Master\u2019s in Special Education Programs. No. 15 \u2013 Best Master\u2019s in Educational Administration Programs. No. 17 \u2013 Best Master\u2019s in Secondary Education Programs. No. 25 \u2013 Best Master\u2019s in Education Policy Programs. The college placed No. 11 in curriculum and instruction for its degrees in early childhood education and gifted education, which are both offered fully online. Degrees in autism spectrum disorders, applied behavior analysis, special education and teacher certification earned the college the No. 12 ranking in special education, while the Master of Education in Elementary Education and Master of Education in Elementary Education (Teacher Certification) ranked No. 12 elementary education programs. The college is ranked No. 8 in the U.S. News ranking of online education programs, making it one of only four universities ranked in the top 15 in both the overall graduate rankings and the online master\u2019s degree rankings (joined by the University of Georgia, the University of Virginia and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). The college now offers its graduate-level teacher preparation programs in two online formats. Arizona residents can choose between either the asynchronous format delivered via ASU Online or a synchronous format delivered via ASU Sync. Students who reside outside Arizona can take classes asynchronously. In both modalities, students complete professional residencies in-person in schools near where they live. \u201CIt\u2019s important for us to be excellent, and it\u2019s important for us to be accessible,\u201D Basile said. \u201CAccessibility means we pride ourselves on whom we include. It also means we continue to work hard to design our curricula and our formats in ways that make our programs accessible to as many learners as possible so they, in turn, can help strengthen as many communities as possible. \"By putting our outstanding graduate-level teacher-prep programs online, for instance, we have made it easier for school (human resource) managers who have been forced to hire people on emergency or temporary certification to consider sending those educators to us so they can complete their preparation.\u201D Read more: U.S. News & World Report ranks 13 ASU graduate programs in top 10 nationwide, 39 in the top 20 University News Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College Education Faculty Graduate student Meghan Krein Copywriter, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College 602.543.1603 Meghan.krein@asu.edu Trending on ASU News Solutions What will it take for people to choose sustainable modes of transportation?
