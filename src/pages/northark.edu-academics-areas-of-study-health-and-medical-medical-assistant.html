Faculty Contact Angie Moix CNA\/Medical Assisting Program Director (870) 391-3140 angie.moix@northark.edu \"I love helping others. I made it to the RN program but had to drop at the end of second semester due to having to work two full-time jobs so it was hard to do. So coming back, I only needed a few classes to become a medical assistant so I decided to do it. I do still plan on becoming a RN. (Instructor) Rhonda Matthews has been awesome and has given me my motivation back! This is a stepping stone to my career goal.\" - Heidi Kupgisch, medical assisting student Learning Outcomes Medical Assistant Graduates of the Medical Assisting program complete both the Administrative Medical Assistant and Clinical Medical Assistant programs, combining the required courses for each certificate of proficiency.
