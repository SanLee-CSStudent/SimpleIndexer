This room features exhibits showcasing the contributions of Robert C. Watson, M.D. (1908-1994), who was known as the the \"father of neurosurgery in Arkansas.\" A native of Mena, Arkansas, Dr. Watson graduated from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine (now UAMS) in 1935. The Watson Room was furnished and dedicated in 1980, by Dr. Watson's professional associates in his honor upon his retirement from an active practice of neurosurgery. Donors for the Watson Room included Drs. W. Ray Jouett, John H. Adametz, Robert D. Dickins Jr., Wilbur M. Giles, David L. Reding, and Ronald N. Williams. In 2021, Dr. Watson's daughter, Lindsey Watson Allen, and granddaughter, Katharine Allen Adams, generously underwrote the installation of a new exhibit case in the room.
