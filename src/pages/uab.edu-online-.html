However, our online class technology was thoughtfully crafted prior to the pandemic, and always will be. As a UAB Online student, you'll benefit from our creativity and innovation regardless of our course delivery or instructional methods. All of our online programs implement top technology including Lightboard and Podium programs, and are purposefully crafted for synchronous online learning that allows professors and students to meet in real time. In fact, many of our online and hybrid\/blended courses have gone through the Quality Matters peer review process, meeting the gold-standard for online courses and programs. This means all of the courses you take with UAB Online have undergone a rigorous peer-reviewed process to ensure quality instruction and continuous improvement. Lightboard Lab Demonstration Here are two technology resources that we use in UAB Online courses. Lightboard is used to diagram complex formulas or processes on video. Lab Demonstration Videos demonstrate lab techniques to prepare you in advance for your lab course. With UAB\u2019s superior reputation compared to other universities, I had no reservations about exploring their online offerings. The experience with the online format has been superlative. The professors and instructors provide the same level of support and quality of enlightenment as if I were on campus. Christopher Allen Perry BS in Health Care Management Traditional education programs really emphasize 'what' teachers do while the IDD program sought to explore and understand 'how' and 'why teachers do what they do. The program has completely altered how I approach teaching and instruction and my perspective on education. Markell Payne MS in Instructional Design and Development Because I am already a full-time UAB employee, I needed a program that was fully online to accommodate my work schedule. This program is wonderful. The classes are tough but manageable, and the education I have received is excellent and perfectly suited to how I intend to use it. Aleisha Dorning MAEd in Community Health I am a hands-on person and I enjoy the social interaction with students and instructors to better understand the material. My biggest concern about learning online was that this type of interaction would not be present. This has not at all been the case. Our group discussions, guest lectures, and live classes have been very beneficial to my learning experience.
