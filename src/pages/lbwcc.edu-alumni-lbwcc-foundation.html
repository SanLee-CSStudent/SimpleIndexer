Wallace Community College Foundation The Lurleen B. Wallace Community College (LBWCC) Foundation was formed in 1970 with the purpose of promoting and supporting the programs and activities of Lurleen B. Wallace Community College and the students of Butler, Covington, Crenshaw and surrounding counties. Non-Profit Status The LBWCC Foundation is a tax-exempt organization described in Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3). Contributions are tax deductible. Governance A volunteer board of directors composed of local citizens governs all aspects of the foundation, including fundraising, investments, and scholarship distributions. Directors of the LBWCC Foundation are dedicated to providing leadership with integrity for the preservation of endowments, growth of investments, and aiding the financial needs of students attending LBWCC. Scholarships Many students attending LBWCC are the first in their family to attend college, or pursue any type of formal education beyond high school. Even though tuition at LBWCC is a fraction of the cost of that at universities, the cost can still pose a financial hardship for some. By providing scholarships, the LBWCC Foundation can make a difference in whether or not a student can attend and\/or complete a degree or certificate program of study. The annual deadline for scholarship applications is usually around the first of March. Apply for foundation scholarships through the online institutional scholarship application packet found at www.lbwcc.edu from January until the deadline each year. LBWCC Foundation scholarships apply to both traditional and nontraditional students (those who are 21 years of age or older, obtained a GED, or graduated from high school more than one year ago). Dual Enrollment Scholarships Dual Enrollment scholarships are awarded every year to high school students taking courses that count toward both high school and college credit. Each academic year, scholarship applications are made available online with deadline submission dates. Academic Dual Enrollment: A limited number of academic dual enrollment scholarships are provided through funding by the LBW Community College Foundation and Wells Fargo Foundation, Applicants must submit the application package by the due date to be eligible. Scholarships cover one college course (up to three credit hours) for one semester. Although high school counselors work with students to complete an application package, it is the responsibility of the student to ensure the College is in receipt of their application. Technical Dual Enrollment: The State of Alabama provides funding for career technical dual enrollment students through the Office of Workforce Development. For more information on applying for technical dual enrollment scholarships, call 334.493.5320. Endowments Create a legacy by establishing an endowed scholarship. Monies donated for an endowment remain untouched, with investment interest used to fund scholarships. The first step to creating an endowment is to contact a member of the LBWCC Foundation Board of Directors, or simply call representatives of LBW Community College. Contact information is listed below. How you can help The LBWCC Foundation is funded entirely by donations and gifts from caring donors who are committed to helping LBW Community College and its students. All gifts are entirely tax deductible. There are many ways a donation can be made: Donations from individuals or community organizations Corporate support from the business community Planned giving -- gifts arranged now but taking effect in the future, such as bequests Other giving includes: Tribute gifts are nice ways to recognize others. For donations of $25 or more, the Foundation informs the family or honoree of the donor's kindness with a card, but the amount of the gift is kept confidential. In Memory -- Take time to remember or honor a loved one, someone you treasured, with a memorial gift. In Honor -- A gift can be made on behalf of a friend, colleague, or loved one, or to salute a special occasion such as birthday, anniversary, retirement, or graduation. Life Insurance -- The LBWCC Foundation may be named the beneficiary in a life insurance policy. A suggestion is a permanent type of life insurance where the donor need only sustain the policy for a minimum number of years until the policy dividends are equal to the annual premium. Legacies -- An excellent way to perpetuate a cause you believe in through a properly executed Last Will and Testament.
