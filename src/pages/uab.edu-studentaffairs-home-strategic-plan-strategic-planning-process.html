STATE\/ UA SYSTEM DISCUSSION NATIONAL\/INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE NATIONAL\/INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES ETC. NATIONAL\/INTERNATIONAL DISCUSSION DATA COLLECTION & CURATION DATA COLLECTION & CURATION DISCUSSION Creating an innovative strategic plan for the UAB Division of Student Affairs was a collective effort with assistance and feedback from students, colleagues and stakeholders from across the Division, UAB and the City of Birmingham. In fall 2019, under the leadership of Dr. John Jones, a core leadership team of the Assistant Vice Presidents and several directors was assembled to build a path toward the plan. An environmental scan was needed to assess challenges, opportunities and threats for a UAB Student Affairs in the future. Four areas of focus were identified: UAB\/Birmingham, Alabama\/System, National\/ International and Data Collection. Next, a call was made across the Division for experienced colleagues to serve on the subcommittees conducting the scan. More than 40 professionals were selected to work under the charge of discovering, analyzing and synthesizing current trends, perceptions, limitations, needs and resources to be incorporated into a series of Divisional priorities that align with those of the University of Alabama System, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the community and our students. Over the course of ten months, colleagues evaluated current Student Affairs programs, events and initiatives as well as conducted interviews, reviewed and analyzed countless data, hosted focus groups and facilitated surveys. Soon, the information began to take shape into what could be an innovative future Student Affairs. Then, the collective drafted a series of priorities, objectives and initiatives for the next five years. This draft of a plan was distributed with several efforts to collect feedback from the entire division, which included directors leading discussions with their staff and the distribution of a divisionwide survey. The plan presented herein outlines those priorities, objectives and goals in detail. It is a living, breathing document; some initiatives are already in motion and some areas may even have gaps that we intend to fill. This is a journey for us, with the goal of constantly revisiting our efforts as we forge a path for success. \"It is a living, breathing document; some initiatives are already in motion and some areas may even have gaps that we intend to fill.\" Timeline 2019-2020 For ten months, UAB Student Affairs worked tirelessly to create a strategic plan that would lead to a 21st century model. Below are some significant points along the way. June Shared newly developed Strategic Plan with the Director Team. Directors gathered feedback from their staff in relation to the plan Staff provided feedback regarding Vision, Mission, Core Values and Strategic Priorities Cabinet met to review feedback 2020-2026 Strategic Vision, Mission, Core Values and Strategic Priorities are shared with Directors for creation of departmental goals that will move the strategic plan forward. July Feedback on overall plan inclusive of new objectives New plan is shared with Directors August Delivery of AY21 Goal Tracking Worksheet that articulates departmental goals related to newly developed 2020-2026 Division of Student Affairs Strategic Plan Strategic Plan finalized for posting to website Environmental Scan Charge The charge of each committee is to utilize multiple methods in order to systematically identify internal and external opportunities and threats to UAB and the communities we serve. The committee will identify trends, using a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Method The committee identified various sources to support the data collection process of the UAB\/Birmingham scan. A SWOT analysis was conducted in an effort to streamline effort. After the SWOT analysis, subcommittee members were assigned various focuses within the UAB and Birmingham communityto focus their research. Interview data was retrieved from both inperson interviews as well as excerpts taken from other subcommittees\u2019 interviews with university officials. These interviews included interviews with the Director of International Student Scholar Services, the VP for Student Affairs, The VP for Diversity Equity and Inclusion, as well as Enrollment Management. These individuals were vital in identifying the many emerging and current trends happening at the university. Reports and Data were collected by reviewing various documents within the academic units as well as within a number of administration offices. These reports include the university\u2019s strategic plan and the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion\u2019s Diversity strategic plan.Other data included Birmingham census data along with other city metrics. During committee meetings, group members gave updates to compare information with other members as well as discussed additional information that needed to be collected. Results The committee identified several clear themes that emerged from the focus groups, interviews, benchmarking, and data sources that were reviewed. Challenges Challenges Covid-19\u2019s forcing of students into an online environment Recovery stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic Underutilization of captioning services Limited facilities based on recent student growth Only 50 percent of students from Birmingham City Schools go on to get advanced education Many students need financial literacy before they get to UAB Birmingham students can only access the Birmingham Promise initiative if they meet UAB\u2019s admission criteria Be eligible for UAB admission, which for fall 2020 is a minimum 20 ACT score and a minimum of 2.75 GPA.

There are varies academic units that have services that replicate the services offered through the Division of Student Affairs, which threatens its ability to serve all students. Greater effort to provide diversity education opportunities across campus. Development of Campus Creed establishing a framework for university values 10,771 of UAB undergraduate students live off campus; 3,065 live on campus. From the Off-Campus Student Services 2019 off-campus student survey, 296\/378 respondents live more than 3 miles from campus. Only 43\/378 respondents say they commute to campus by walking or biking; all others drive.

Signature Core Curriculum Birmingham is the 12th largest banking center in the nation and third in the Southeast. Birmingham was voted the #1 Best City for Millennial Entrepreneurs (Thumbtack,2015) based on friendliness of local tax laws, licensing rules, and the regulatory environment. 20,000 prospective employees graduate annually from Birmingham\u2019s region universities Cost of living is 85 percent of the national average Birmingham is a national leader in urban green spaces. Thousands of wooded acres for biking and hiking are within minutes of downtown in area parks. Birmingham\u2019s role in America\u2019s Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s placed the city at the center of the most significant domestic drama of the 20th The city\u2019s Civil Rights District is now designated a National Monument. According to UAB\u2019s new Signature Core Curriculum plan, one of their goals is to include \u201Cco-curricular connections.\u201D They plan to work with \u201Csupportsins offices andgroups to identify ways that the curriculum and co-curriculum might complement one another.\u201D This is an opportunity for Student Affairs to serve as leaders and teachers in co-curricular best practice as well as take a leadership role in this initiative. Assistant Vice President Mary Wallace is working with this committee. In addition, there are plans to partner with local organizations and entities to give student immersive out-ofclassroom learning experiences tied to the history of the City of Birmingham. Discussion After a thorough, broad, and deep environmental scan of the state of Alabama and the UAB system, the following themes emerged consistently and repeatedly across all data sources: The impact of Covid-19 on the experiences of students moving forward brings much uncertainty to the division\u2019s plan moving forward. It is imperative that the division implement a plan that accounts for the broad impacts that will certainly play a role in the development of programs, activities, and services moving forward. The Birmingham Promise initiative stemming from the City of Birmingham presents an opportunity for retaining and graduating a group of students that could be a new segment of students on campus. The division plan should consider retention and graduation strategies that considers more students who are coming from schools who are less resourced. Lastly, the continued growth of the institution presents some unique challenges and opportunities for the division. If growth continues, the physical infrastructure of campus will change along with the academic and cocurricular resources for students. State\/ UA System Committee Charge The charge of each committee is to utilize multiple methods in order to systematically identify internal and external opportunities and threats to UAB and the communities we serve. The committee will identify challenges, influences and trends, using a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis. Method The committee identified a comprehensive list of sources to research for the state and UA system environmental scan. In order to keep our focus on the state and system levels, two target audiences were identified for focus groups, including UAB Trailblazers and UAB Admission Counselors. Benchmarking research included the UA System institutions, The University of Alabama and The University of Alabama at Huntsville. Additionally, online benchmarking research of state school\u2019s websites for Student Affairs divisions was conducted for several additional schools, as listed in the Data Sources Table. Schools were evaluated based on existence of a Division of Student Affairs or a comparable organization within their institution and availability of a Strategic Plan. Benchmarking was also conducted for state professional networks and organizations including NASPA Alabama, the Alabama Association for Higher Education Diversity Officers, disability, counseling, facilities, parent and family programs, and career services. Benchmarking data included gathering responses from institutions around their challenges, influences and trends and identifying themes across the state from these networks and organizations. Interviews were conducted with key leadership in order to obtain their perspectives, ideas, and experiences in higher education within the state of Alabama and the UA System in regard to challenges, influences, and trends. Statewide reports reviewed and discussed included the First Destination Survey, the Student Clearinghouse, and all data related to enrollment trends for Alabama. During committee meetings, group members presented their findings and through group discussion, themes were identified that emerged from the multiple data sources. Results The committee identified several clear themes (which follow) from the focus groups, interviews, benchmarking, and data sources. Challenges The decrease in population of high school students (future college students) has numerous significant implications. Increased competition for students among universities Risk for decrease in state appropriations: a decrease in the population in the state may result in less spending in the state, which means less money for education Alabama has a shortage of qualified, skilled people for the workforce Alabama workforce demonstrates lack of career development in soft-skills; individuals may be able to obtain a job, they are losing jobs based on skills that would be referred to as \u201Csoft skills\u201D (not industry-specific skills) Negative impact on the economy, also impacts why Alabama is not attractive to outside organizations Alabama is not intrinsically attractive to those outside the state\/nation. Alabama is not attracting people to our state. Several themes emerged that may provide reasons for this: Economy is suffering, in part to the under-developed workforce, which impacts the economy Alabama is \u201Clagging behind\u201D in the broad definition of diversity and providing a place where people want to move Across the state of Alabama, institutions are consistently reporting the demand for mental health services for students continues to increase each year Space is a challenge Shortage of adequate staffing Increase in severity, crisis, suicidality of students The increase of the attractiveness of 2-year and on-the-job training has increased & creates competition for 4-year institutions, forcing 4-year institutions to reconsider offerings outside the traditional undergraduate degree. Increasing costs of education and socioeconomic impacts on students with diverse backgrounds Across the state of Alabama, institutions are consistently reporting a continued increase of students with disabilities seeking services; meeting increased demand for test proctoring and faculty needs creating challenges to meet the needs for those providing services Trends Increase in 2-year institution transfers to UAB from within the state Increase in Hispanic population overall in the state Increased utilization of counseling services at state institutions Enrollment is increasing at UAB Online enrollment is increasing at UAB and other institutions Online offerings allow individuals with some college credits to complete degrees in a non-traditional format Diversity and inclusion efforts provide an educational opportunity regarding first amendment understanding\/protections Institutions are providing a space to learn, experience others, and not looking to silence opposing positions Students seem to lack an overall ability to manage and cope with stress Steadily increasing numbers of students with disabilities registering for services Influences UA System in-state tuition freeze Online enrollment of out of state students; impact on state Population decrease for college-age Alabama residents Opportunity for 2-year and on-thejob training, certificates, and other credentialing may offer opportunity for 4-year institutions to remain attractive and relevant Institutions in the state of Alabama have university diversity offices and their own strategic plans Discussion After a thorough, broad, and deep environmental scan of the state of Alabama and the UAB system, the following themes emerged consistently and repeatedly across all data sources: The decrease in the high school population in Alabama is going to directly impact higher education in the state of Alabama resulting in increased competition for students, and a risk of decreased state appropriations because the impact this decreasing population will have on spending and the Alabama economy. The Alabama workforce has a significant influence on institutions of higher education and the following factors are considerations as we develop a plan to impact our students\u2019 success. The increase of individuals seeking 2-year and onthe-job continuing education is already resulting in UAB focusing efforts on certificate programs and other non-degree educational options; this changes the student demographics on campus To maintain a strong economy, Alabama must have a skilled and healthy workforce. As the largest employer in the state of Alabama and a significant economic force in the state, UAB must develop students who can be successful in employment post-graduation What role does UAB have in helping raise the attractability of Alabama to those outside the state of Alabama, including recruiting students, families, domestic and international employees? Colleges across the state are concerned about mental health and wellbeing of students. State colleges and universities are all reporting increased utilization and demand for mental health resources. Institutions are also all reporting that they are struggling to keep up with the demand and to provide the personnel and physical space to provide these services. The number of students who are registering with Disability Support Services offices continues to increase each year, including the number of students with mental health and psychiatric concerns. Students seem to lack an overall ability to manage and cope with stress National\/ International Committee Charge The charge of each committee is to utilize multiple methods in order to systematically identify internal and external opportunities and threats to UAB and the communities we serve. The committee will identify trends, using a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Method Using a mixed-method approach to data collection, the committee implemented several research methods: surveys, interviews, and focus group to systemically identify national and international challenges, influences, or trends that may affect higher education over the next five years. Surveys were distributed to three participant groups: seniorlevel Student Affairs administrators at UAB peer institutions, notable Student Affairs practitioners from across the country, and focus group participants. All surveys consisted of one multiple-select question and one to two open-ended questions. The multiple-select question asked respondents to identify the top three items that they feel are most likely to impact Higher Education, Student Affairs, and students over the next five years. Open-ended questions allowed survey participants to share additional information in an open text format. The committee conducted several interviews with UAB administrators, UAB Student Affairs staff, community partners, and external UAB Higher Education practitioners to gather data about challenges, influences, or trends that may affect higher education on a national or international level over the next five years. In total, members of the committee conducted 14 interviews. A focus group was held with international students to capture their experiences and views as a student attending college in a country that differs from their home country. Participants were recruited by outreaching to students who served as employees of the UAB University Recreation Center and International Mentors in the Office of Student Multicultural Diversity Programs. Of the eight students invited to participate in the focus group, six choose to do so. Participants were asked a series of eight open-ended questions. A focus group was held with SGA leadership in order to gather feedback and insight specific to student leadership across various academic areas for the undergraduate population. The UAB SGA allowed representatives from the Student Affairs Strategic Planning Team to attend their monthly meeting and spend thirty minutes talking to students, asking questions, and inviting feedback. Leaders from the SGA were present, and the majority of Senators were present as a quorum was met. An introduction was provided to the focus group which addressed the purpose of the focus group, a review of the departments within Student Affairs, the current Student Affairs Strategic Plan and the process of developing a Strategic Plan for the next five years. Students were asked a series of eight open-ended questions. Feedback was collected by the Student Affairs facilitators. Once data from all sources was collected, members of the committee identified key themes that emerged from the multiple sources. Results The committee identified several clear themes from the focus groups, interviews, benchmarking, and data sources noted on the following sections. Challenges Current Political Climate Social and political environment continues to be a challenge for international recruitment leading to a decrease in international student enrollment. Title IX regulations and rollback on policy guidelines and anti-discrimination laws. College Student Health and General Wellness Increased number of students reporting mental health concerns. Mental health and related issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression rank at the top of health concerns on campuses, as rates of suicide and withdrawal from school have increased. Anxiety continues to be the number one presenting concern. Mental health demand and utilization of services on college campuses have been increasing steadily and quickly each year. Educating students on what is fact versus what might be construed in a way that is used to market products. Examples of this may be Instagram influencers who push products as \u201Cweight loss magic\u201D without any research to back it up. Increased number of college-age students presenting signs of food and housing insecurities. Impact of the 2008 Recession Recruitment\/Enrollment Increased competition for prospective students at four-year schools as well as two-year trade schools Decline in available number of collegeage students. Expected decrease in enrollment institutions across the country. Student Loan Debt\/Affordability Student debt is at an all-time high. Students and parents will likely demand transparency regarding affordability of an education. Increased need in scholarships Increased need in funding assistance Trends College Student Health and General Wellness Development of prevention and education efforts that can help students learn resiliency, coping skills, self-care, and how to address problems or concerns. Increase number of faculty and staff presenting signs of mental distress Activism Student expectations and need for safe and supportive environments in which they can safely voice their beliefs, opinions, and concerns. Influences Increase in the number for students that are choosing to attend schools based on expected job placement after graduation. Increase in competition to recruit students in general as well as for online programs Discussion The National\/International Committee coordinated and executed an extensive environmental scan that utilized multiple approaches to collect and analyze data on the national and international level. Focus groups, surveying, interviewing, as well as research collection\/analysis was utilized by the committee to identify the most consistent themes through our process. Many of the same challenges, influences, and trends consistently presented, which support the reliability of the data and conclusions found in this report. The following themes emerged consistently and repeatedly across all data sources: The impact of the 2008 recession, resulting in the decline of college-age students available to attend college. During this time, it is expected that we will see a drop-in student enrollment across the country, increase competition for students from colleges and universities, an increase in university closures, and an increase in students choosing to attend 4-year institutions. College student mental health continues to be a top concern for faculty, staff, and students. Anxiety is the top presenting concern among college students, followed by depression, and relationship problems. Development of prevention strategies that promote emotional wellbeing, with the goal of reducing suicide and substance abuse, continues to be a top priority for Student Affairs practitioners. Specific focus was aimed to assess the international student population at UAB. Current UAB international students, administrators at UAB as well as Student Affairs professionals across the country, consistently identified the following as the \u201Ctop\u201D issues facing our current and potential international students: employment opportunities, safety (travel, on-campus identity), online student needs, affordability (meeting academic and basic needs). College student loan debt among all college students continues to be a consistent challenge. In recent years, the average cost to attend a public four-year institution has more than tripled. Discussions among college administrators include the need to increase scholarships and funding assistance. Student activism continues to be a leading concern and discussion topic at colleges and universities across the nation. Student activist efforts continue to demand administrative accountability around issues of equity and inclusion on campus. These movements demand engagement and support from administrators to honor the students\u2019 experiences and efforts as well as to respect institutional commitments to advance equity and inclusion. Data Collection & Curation Charge The Data Collection and Curation Committee is responsible for aggregating data into a format for review, identifying trends inherent in the data, areas of distinction, opportunities and needs within the division for the purpose of the development of strategic priorities. Method The interdisciplinary committee, representing nine areas within the Division of Student Affairs, reviewed institutional, divisional, and departmental data collected since 2016. Extensive assessment resources were reviewed to identify challenges, influences, and trends within the data. The review revealed perceptions and outcomes related to student engagement, removal of barriers, impact on the student experience, supporting students through the services offered within the Division of Student Affairs, and future focus for the division. A stakeholder survey was conducted for campus collaborators to identify challenges, influences, and trends, based on findings from the data review. Student focus groups were also conducted to identify student perspectives and preferences. The following Challenges, Influences, and Trends emerged from the review of the existing data, surveys, and focus groups with students: Challenges Challenges Campus safety Improving four year and six year graduation rates Mitigating barriers to student success Mental Health support Systematically measuring the impact of student involvement on retention and graduation Staying responsive to changing student needs during FiveYear Strategic Plan cycle Effective partnerships with university constituents and external stakeholders Influences Influences Legal and political impact of higher education Demand for access to services, information, and support through technology State and Federal immigration policies on international enrollment and retention Core curriculum on-ramp\/Birmingham as classroom Enrollment targets impact on scaling services for additional students Excellent reputation among prospective students, families and community Student-centered programs and services connecting students through engagement and services Collaborative and supportive relationships with student leadership Responsive to feedback from students, faculty, staff and external stakeholders Accessibility Development of Social Justice competency Signature Core Curriculum Trends Trends Increase in individualized services to meet unique needs\/remove barriers Data-driven planning and programming Online enrollment growth Supporting students through enhanced technology\/online services Increase in student participation of programs and services Embracing and celebrating our diverse campus Financial resource constraints and allocation of funding Retention strategy development Rising occurrence and complexity of student mental health needs\/support Ability to remain current with student technology trends Changing student demographics and ability to forecast into programs and services Potential rising cost of attendance Student Onboarding, Expectation Guidance, Sense of Belonging Leveraging unique UAB student attributes to provide unique and distinct best practices Discussion The Data Collection Committee has identified these fundamental questions and critical challenges: The role of the Division of Student Affairs in student success: Resources to support student college experience\/sense of belonging and to develop students holistically Meeting student needs beyond academics Student advocacy at the highest level Additional first generation and transfer student support Student financial literacy support Connecting students to resources and services Focusing on students\u2019 resilience Academic Affairs\/Student Affairs partnership to enhance student success: Continued and strategic partnership Extracurricular\/developing more high impact practices like service learning\/experiential learning Intentional collaboration with high impact practices Continued integration of student affairs, academic advising, and faculty to create a more holistic community for students Campus-wide peer mentoring training and development Creative integration of student affairs into the classroom discussion\/activities Student Engagement, Involvement, and Success: Program attendance, organization involvement, and relationships with faculty, staff, and peers have impact on student sense of belonging Student define success as getting good grades, obtaining a degree, preparing for after college, developing relationships, and learning new skill. They identified connections, involvement, and student programs and services as contributors to student success Students would like to have: Safe spaces and inclusive campus community More opportunities to connect with students with similar interests and diverse others Weekend programming More support for Fraternity & Sorority life- we have diverse community Programs for graduate students Programs for transfer students Focus more on out of state students Student Affairs Home Parents and Family Future Students Current Students Disability Support Services Faculty Employees News The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Main Switchboard: (205) 934-4011 Hearing Impaired\/TDD: (205) 934-4642 One Stop Student Services: (205) 934-4300 Contact Student Affairs Website Edit Requests Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
