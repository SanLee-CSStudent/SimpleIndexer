And kidney disease is a particular burden for many Alabamians. But by transplanting gene-edited pig kidneys into an individual who had been declared brain dead, a UAB team has delivered a breakthrough that may end the burden of waiting. IT REALLY BEGAN IN 1966. That\u2019s when a young physician named John Kirklin, M.D., decided to take a chance on the fledgling UAB Department of Surgery and accept the offer to become their new chair. Before coming to UAB, Kirklin had revolutionized cardiac surgery at the Mayo Clinic by performing the world\u2019s first open-heart procedures. A respected surgeon on a rocket-ship ride to a renowned career, he shocked transplant doctors across the country by choosing UAB\u2014a young institution located in the Deep South\u2014during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. His goal: establish a top-notch transplant program that could compete with the nation\u2019s best. John Kirklin, M.D., in surgery. Joined in 1967 by the young Arnold G. Diethelm, M.D., who had trained under renowned surgeon and eventual Nobel Prize recipient Joseph Murray, M.D., in Boston, Kirklin began to build the first transplant program in the Southeast. Murray\u2019s first transplant in 1954 had been a success, but it relied on a donor who was an identical twin to the recipient, which meant their shared genes vastly reduced the risk that the transplanted kidney would be rejected. The failures of subsequent procedures that relied on unrelated donors led to public criticisms of Murray and other transplant surgeons. \u201CBack in the 1960s, renal transplantation was still in its infancy,\u201D says Carlton Young, M.D., director of the Birmingham Veteran's Administration's adult kidney transplant program and Children\u2019s of Alabama\u2019s pediatric kidney transplant program. \u201CDr. Diethelm would often say the most common transplant was putting a kidney in, and the second most common surgery was taking them out.\u201D But Kirklin and Diethelm persisted, and in 1968, the UAB team was ready to perform the first kidney transplant in Alabama. Navy veteran Hollis Milton Lucas received a kidney from his brother, making his procedure the first of the more than 16,000 transplants that have since been performed at UAB via its Comprehensive Transplant Institute. Only the University of California-San Francisco has performed more kidney transplants than UAB since statistics began being kept on Jan. 1, 1988. In fact, from Jan. 1, 1988, through Dec. 31, 2021, UAB performed 9,055 kidney transplants, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, including almost 3,435 living donor transplants.

Kirklin and Diethelm exemplified the aggressive commitment to excellence in service, collaboration, and innovation for which UAB has become known around the world,\u201D said UAB President Ray Watts, M.D. \u201CThe foundation they laid has continued to bring some of the brightest minds in the field to Birmingham and the southeast\u2014where the disease burden is significant\u2014to save and improve thousands of lives.\u201D Because of Kirklin\u2019s and Diethelm\u2019s vision, and the investment of resources and talent over the ensuing five decades, UAB has been able to pioneer new medications, advance research, and improve surgical techniques while serving some of the poorest and most marginalized patients\u2014a fitting legacy of Kirklin\u2019s bold step to choose Birmingham in 1966. The Chain Kidney disease kills more people each year than breast or prostate cancer, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Although transplantation is the gold standard treatment for end-stage kidney disease, fewer than 25,000 kidney transplants are performed each year in the United States, and 240 Americans on dialysis die every day. The wait for a deceased donor kidney can be five years or more and in many states, it is closer to 10 years. Almost 5,000 people on the kidney waiting list die each year. UAB physicians say that knowing there is a life-saving therapy available to doctors, but a limited supply of organs, is the most challenging part of their job. \u201CThe hardest part is seeing patients in clinic and wait-listing them knowing that they might actually die before I ever get an organ-offer to transplant them,\u201D says Jayme Locke, M.D., director of the Comprehensive Transplant Institute in the Heersink School of Medicine Department of Surgery. Thankfully, much has changed since the 1950s and 1960s, when donor-recipient incompatibility and a lack of immunosuppressant drugs meant poor outcomes for many transplant patients. With those advances, UAB has been able to build the South\u2019s leading incompatible kidney-transplant program, which makes transplantation possible between some donors and recipients who otherwise would not match. This process enabled doctors to transplant more patients in unique ways, including through a chain of transplants known as a kidney chain. Many transplant programs require a completely compatible match, and some donor-recipient pairs in the kidney chain are compatible matches. But UAB has the ability to make matches even when pairs are incompatible due to differences in blood group or tissues. Pretreatment desensitization, which may include removing reactive antibodies from the recipient\u2019s blood, using drugs to lower numbers of reactive immune cells, or reducing the ability of immune cells to respond and proliferate, overcome those differences and allow for the survival of an incompatible kidney. UAB began what has become a record kidney chain on Dec. 5, 2013, when Pelham, Alabama, resident and donor Paula King approached UAB about the possibility of donating a kidney to a stranger in need. King was committed to donating a kidney despite not having an intended recipient. In a paired transplant chain, a donation like this can set off a series in which family or friends of recipients give a kidney to another person in need\u2014essentially paying donations forward on behalf of a loved one. King\u2019s altruistic gift began a chain of transplants that involves people from multiple states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. UAB\u2019s kidney chain is now the world\u2019s longest at 126 transplants. \u201CTo me, these are miracles,\u201D says Locke. \u201CThis is a life-changer for these patients and their families and friends. Every time someone comes forward to be a living kidney donor\u2014whether they know someone they want to donate to or on behalf of\u2014I just marvel at it,\u201D Locke said. \u201CThey are all extraordinary individuals, and they really represent the very best of our country and the world.\u201D ALABAMA IS A HOT SPOT FOR KIDNEY DISEASE Of the 37 million Americans living with kidney disease, a significant number of those people live in Alabama. \u201CRegionally, the high incidence of kidney disease in the southeast is a major complication of other diseases such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes,\u201D says Anupam Agarwal, M.D., executive vice dean and professor of nephrology in the\u202FHeersink\u202FSchool of Medicine. \u201CBlack\/African Americans, Latinx, and Hispanic communities, and other underrepresented minorities have a much higher predisposition to kidney disease,\u201D he says. \u201CThis disparity could be related to genetic factors, specifically a gene called apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1)\u2014a component of high-density lipoprotein that transports cholesterol and certain fats through the bloodstream from the body\u2019s tissues to the liver. Mutations in the APOL1 gene render Black\/African Americans more susceptible to kidney disease.\u201D Plus, with increased incidences of high blood pressure and other underlying conditions, the chances of kidney disease are much higher in communities of color. In the same way, Agarwal says, social determinants of health deeply contribute to the kidney disease burden in Alabama, an issue that has been publicly exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201CDiet and salt intake, access to health care, and access to exercise make a huge difference in kidney health,\u201D he says. \u201CWe still see patients who show up in the emergency room who have never had their blood pressure checked and have never seen a doctor in their entire lives due to mistrust in medicine and\/or lack of access to health care. They have end-stage kidney disease needing emergent dialysis and ultimately a transplant.\u201D Agarwal says the best treatment for kidney disease is prevention, particularly since kidney disease does not cause any pain during early stages. \u201CStaying up-to-date on annual physicals is a great way to stay protected,\u201D he says. Agarwal also says that kidneys can be protected by eating a well-balanced diet, aiming for a healthy weight, managing blood pressure, reducing stress, and exercising. For those living with diabetes, having blood glucose maintained with treatment can help prevent kidney disease. \u2014By Mary Ashley Canevaro A New Frontier But a new approach may one day end the need for the kidney chain. Fifty-three years after Kirklin and Diethelm transplanted the first kidney in Alabama, Locke and her team have tested the first human preclinical model for transplanting genetically modified pig kidneys into humans. They published their results on January 20, 2022, in the \u201CAmerican Journal of Transplantation\u201D. Transplanting an animal organ into a human to cure disease is called \u201Cxenotransplantation.\u201D Utilizing genetically modified pig kidneys could provide an increased supply for those needing a kidney transplant. The study was conducted to meet the standards directly comparable to those that would apply to a Phase I human clinical trial, mirroring\u2014as much as possible\u2014every step of a standard transplant between humans. It included Institutional Review Board and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval; a tissue-compatibility confirmation before starting the operations; using the standard procedures of human-to-human transplants to remove, preserve, transport, and transplant the kidneys into a human; and giving the standard immunosuppression therapy to the recipient. Jayme Locke, M.D., performing a kidney transplant. For the first time, the kidneys transplanted were taken from a pig that had been genetically modified with 10 key gene edits that may make the kidneys suitable for transplant into humans. The study recipient had the two genetically modified pig kidneys transplanted in his abdomen after his native kidneys were removed. The organs were procured from a genetically modified pig at a pathogen-free facility. This process demonstrates the long-term viability of the procedure and how such a transplant might work in the real world. The transplanted kidneys filtered blood, produced urine, and, importantly, were not immediately rejected. The kidneys remained viable until the study was ended, 77 hours after transplant. \u201CThis game-changing moment in the history of medicine represents a paradigm shift and a major milestone in the field of xenotransplantation, which is arguably the best solution to the organ shortage crisis,\u201D says Locke. \u201CWe have bridged critical knowledge gaps and obtained the safety and feasibility data necessary to begin a clinical trial in living humans with end-stage kidney disease.\u201D This effort is supported by biotechnology pioneer United Therapeutics Corp., which awarded a grant to UAB to launch the innovative xenotransplantation program. Revivicor, Inc., a subsidiary of United Therapeutics, provided the genetically modified pig that was the source of the investigational xenotransplant kidneys called UKidney¢â. ABOUT THE XENOTRANSPLANT STUDY UAB's peer-reviewed research on xenotransplantation is a study of ambitious scope and great significance, given that more than 800,000 Americans are living with kidney failure. Most never make it to the waiting list, and far too few human organs are available to put a dent in that number. Although dialysis can sustain life for some time, transplantation offers a better quality of life and a longer life for the few individuals who can gain access to transplantation. Each stage of this decedent xenotransplant study approximated the steps that might be taken in a Phase I xenotransplant clinical trial. The kidneys were removed from a donor pig housed at a pathogen-free, surgically clean facility. The kidneys were then stored, transported, and processed for implantation, just as human kidneys are. Before surgery, the brain-dead recipient and pig donor underwent a UAB-developed crossmatch compatibility test to determine whether the genetically modified pig kidney and its intended recipient were a good tissue match. Researchers made 10 gene edits in the pig kidneys: Three deletions disabled genes that would trigger rejection, and a fourth deletion prevented the pig kidneys from growing too large. The rest were human genes added to the pig genome to prevent the recipient\u2019s immune system from attacking the organs. The pig kidneys were placed in the exact anatomic locations used for human donor kidneys, with the same attachments to the renal artery, renal vein and the ureter that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. The brain-dead recipient received standard immune-suppression therapy used in human-to-human kidney allotransplantation. The \"Parsons Model\" But this scientific and medical breakthrough would not have been possible without Jim Parsons and his family. Jim had a passion for motorcycles and raced off-road dirt bikes competitively. Parsons, 57, was a registered organ donor through Legacy of Hope, Alabama\u2019s organ procurement organization, and though he had longed to have his organs help others upon his death, his organs were not suitable for donation. His family permitted UAB to maintain Parsons on a ventilator to keep his body functioning during the study. His native kidneys were removed, and two genetically modified pig kidneys were transplanted. \u201CMr. Parsons and his family allowed us to replicate precisely how we would perform this transplant in a living human. Their powerful contribution will save thousands of lives, and that could begin in the very near future,\u201D Locke says. \u201CMr. Parsons\u2019 gift honors his legacy. We also believe that it firmly establishes the viability, safety, and feasibility of this preclinical model, which we have proposed to be known as \u2018The Parsons Model.\u2019\u201D Parsons\u2019 ex-wife, Julie O\u2019Hara, and their children, Ally, David, and Cole, made the decision (along with Jim\u2019s sisters and mother) to take part in the study after they were approached by Locke and Alan Spriggs with Legacy of Hope. \u201CJim was a never-met-a-stranger kind of guy who would talk to anyone and had no enemies\u2014none,\u201D O\u2019Hara says. \u201CJim would have wanted to save as many people as he could with his death, and if he knew he could potentially save thousands and thousands of people by doing this, he would have had no hesitation. Our dream is that no other person dies waiting for a kidney, and we know that Jim is very proud that his death could potentially bring so much hope to others.\u201D Life-Changing Impacts Locke says that xenotransplantation promises the consistent availability of compatible, genetically modified organs for patients in desperate need. If many people are compatible for a xenograft from a pig, that\u2014paired with human-to-human allotransplantation\u2014could potentially wipe out the kidney transplant waiting list. Many of the 5,000 people on a waiting list who die every year could be saved if an unlimited supply of kidneys were available. \u201CThe opportunity to have an organ that is waiting there for the person who needs it is just overwhelming to think about,\u201D she says. As Locke and her team continue to progress their research and move to the next phase of their study, the implications of UAB\u2019s breakthrough cannot be overstated. \u201CWe have made significant investments in xenotransplantation for almost a decade hoping for [these] kinds of results,\u201D says Selwyn Vickers, M.D., dean of the Heersink School of Medicine and CEO of the UAB Health System and UAB\/Ascension St. Vincent\u2019s Alliance. \u201C[This is] a remarkable achievement for humanity and advances xenotransplant into the clinical realm.\u201D \u201CThe many breakthroughs in transplant at UAB,\u201D Watts says, \u201Chave been made possible by the pioneers who very purposefully built a visionary foundation for success and made strategic investments, by our faculty and staff who dedicate themselves every day to improving and saving lives, and by those\u2014like Jim Parsons\u2019 family\u2014whose selfless acts serve the greater good.\u201D \u201CI feel very privileged to be just a tiny part of a really big puzzle that people have been working on for many years,\u201D Locke says. \u2022 Learn more about the xenotransplant team, the study, and Jim Parson\u2019s remarkable contribution at go.uab.edu\/xenotransplant.
