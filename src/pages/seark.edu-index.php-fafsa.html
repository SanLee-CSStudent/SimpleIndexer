Many institutional and private scholarships require that you complete this application. Visit the FAFSA Website. Apply October 1 each year.

How to Apply First step: Create an FSA ID An FSA ID is a username and password that you must create to complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You will also use your FSA ID to log in to the U.S. Department of Education websites, StudentLoans.gov, and the National Student Loan Data System (nslds.ed.gov). Create an FSA ID. Step 2: Complete the FAFSA FAFSA is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Completing it is key toward getting federal aid for college. It provides U.S. students with more than $150 billion in grants, work-study funds, and loans each year. But, to find out if you are eligible to receive any of this money, you must complete the FAFSA. When you are ready to get started, visit the FAFSA website and complete the application using our Federal School Code 014893. We recommend you complete your FAFSA between October 1 and May 1.
