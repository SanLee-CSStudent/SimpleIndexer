Students will earn two college credits for completing each workshop. Scholarships are available. These are the first in a series of classes and workshops presented as part of the collaboration between the two educational institutions, offering high quality instruction in traditional American Craft to individuals interested pursuing development of skills in creating handmade objects. These classes apply toward Northark\u2019s new Studio Arts degree, or toward completion of the Artisan Professional Certificate. The workshops are Building an Artisan Box, taught by Doug Stowe on March 18-21. Boxes are among the most interesting woodworking projects because of the endless possibilities they offer for exploring technique, form, and style. Learn the practical aesthetics of box design and several techniques, including preparing stock, joinery, precision milling, assembling, sanding, and finishing. Students will also learn about accurate cutting and shaping of parts, making inlay, using story sticks for accurate fitting of hinges, and cutting small, complicated parts. Bladesmithing will be taught by Allen Newberry on March 24 \u2013 27. Students will dive into bladesmithing by forging their own knife using a hammer and anvil to make a medium-sized full tang knife out of carbon steel and will learn the basics of heat treating with a forge. The project will be finished by grinding the blade and adding a handle to the knife. This workshop will be taught in the world-class Windgate Wood & Iron Studio at ESSA. Students will learn traditional skills taught by master artisans. The classes will be taught at ESSA from 9:30 A.M.\u2013 4:30 P.M. during the college\u2019s Spring Break. A van will provide transportation for students from Northark\u2019s campus to ESSA if enough students are interested.
