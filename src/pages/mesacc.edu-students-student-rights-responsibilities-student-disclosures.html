This broad estimate is based on the cost of attendance and the financial aid that was provided to full-time, first-time degree\/certificate seeking undergraduate students in 2009-10. Actual net price can vary significantly based on student eligibility and does not represent an actual award. Submission of the FAFSA is the only way to obtain a true and accurate determination of eligibility. Estimates apply to full-time, first-time degree\/certificate-seeking undergraduate students. Visit the Net Price Calculator website. Shopping Sheet The Shopping Sheet is intended to provide estimated net price information (defined as estimated cost (price) of attendance \u2013 including tuition and required fees, books and supplies, room and board (meals), and other related expenses \u2013 minus estimated grant and scholarship aid) to current and prospective students and their families based on what similar students paid in a previous year. The estimate provided using the Shopping Sheet does not represent a final determination, or actual award, of financial assistance, or a final net price; it is an estimate based on price of attendance and financial aid provided to students in a previous year. Price of attendance and financial aid availability change year to year. The estimates shall not be binding on the Secretary of Education, the institution or higher education or the State. In the Shopping Sheet section titled \"What will you pay for college\", the net costs are reflective of both costs that are paid directly to MCC, such as tuition and fees, and estimates of costs that students may accrue for other expenses, including books, room\/board, transportation, etc., which is termed \"Estimated Cost of Attendance\". The Net Costs listed in \"What you will pay for college\" are NOT directly paid expenses for college course enrollment and will vary based on a student's personal expenses. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to be eligible for, and receive, an actual financial aid award that includes Federal grant, loan, or work-study assistance. For more information on applying for Federal student aid, go to the FAFSA website. If you are a veteran or a dependent of a veteran, you may be eligible for benefits. Please go to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website for more information. Login to your Student Center on my.maricopa.edu to access the Shopping Sheet located under the finances section.
