The instructor will hold a Master\u2019s degree that includes eighteen (18) hours of completed course work in the subject area of the endorsed concurrent enrollment course. Additional qualifications may be stipulated by departments offering courses; these additional stipulations will be specified before partner schools propose instructors for proposed courses. Courses cannot be approved without simultaneous approval of an instructor meeting university and department qualifications. Information Needed for Instructor Approval Undergraduate transcripts, graduate transcripts, and updated Curriculum Vitae are required for review by departments requested to grant concurrent credit. Other information may be requested by the reviewing department. All questions about instructor eligibility\/qualifications will be referred to the appropriate department chair. Departments will identify courses appropriate for inclusion in the university\u2019s concurrent enrollment initiative. Each high school requesting concurrent credit must request a specific UCA course. High schools requesting a course will be supplied with a current syllabus for the comparable UCA course and with additional course-, program-, or discipline-specific requirements, if any, as stipulated by the department in which a course is housed. From this information, high schools will develop a syllabus that incorporates the required course content and objectives into the high school course curriculum. Concurrent course proposals will be reviewed by the UCA department upon receipt of an appropriate syllabus and other course material from the requesting high school. These materials must include at least the following information, as relevant: lecture\/lab schedule, course objectives, topical coverage, textbook\/lab book titles and editions, assessment methods, and grading scale. Syllabi for any course included in UCA\u2019s general education core will explicitly indicate how the course meets the university\u2019s general education objectives for the area the course is intended to satisfy. UCA\u2019s general education requirements are listed in the Undergraduate Bulletin: for an outline of requirements, see UCA Core; for a list of courses in the lower-division UCA Core, see the LD UCA Core Check Sheet. Additional information such as examples of examinations and other assignments may also be requested by the reviewing department. All questions about course approval will be referred to the appropriate department chair.
