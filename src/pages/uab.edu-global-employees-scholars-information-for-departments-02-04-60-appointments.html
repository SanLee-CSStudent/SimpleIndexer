This includes requests for 60 Volunteer appointments for current F-1 students. These international visitors can be funded by themselves, UAB, their home government, or any combination thereof. UAB's comprehensive, campus-wide process for the onboarding of international visitors addresses not only the health and safety of both the UAB community and the international visitors themselves, but also assures that the international visitors\u2019 time on campus can be mutually productive. A flowchart for the process may be found by viewing the International Visiting Scholar (IVS) Admission Tracking Process. This process must be followed for all 02\/04\/06 appointment requests on campus.
