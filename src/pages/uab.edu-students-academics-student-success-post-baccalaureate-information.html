This information is located in the UAB course catalog. Students who intend to enter a graduate program are responsible for coordinating with their desired program in order to make sure they meet the required coursework, GPA, and application standards for admission. Students interested in taking graduate level classes need to not only contact the department in questions, but also complete a request form and return it to the Graduate School. The baccalaureate advisor can only assist with the removal of Registration Access Codes (RAC) and helping students obtain registration overrides.
