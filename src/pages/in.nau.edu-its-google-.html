Google services at NAU G Suite for Education is the University\u2019s official student email system and offers most of the same tools and features as a personal Google account. G Suite for Education is also available to all faculty and staff to collaborate with students in their courses and departments. Current NAU students, faculty, and staff are eligible for an NAU Google account (including NAU Gmail). If have received a grade in at least one NAU course, you are also eligible. For NAU Students: You need your NAU user ID and password in order to log into your NAU Google account. To make collaborating with your classmates easier, request a Google Group. For NAU Alumni: Alumnus who did not use NAU Google can request one or contact the Student Technology Center. If you attended NAU between 2009 and today, you already have an NAU Google account. Use the Password tool to retrieve your username and password. For NAU Faculty and Staff: G Suite for Education supplements the enterprise Microsoft Exchange email and provides extensive collaborative features. You must have an NAU Google account to use G Suite. Need an NAU Google account? Use the Faculty\/Staff Google Account Request tool. Because of the collaborative features available, there is a potential for improperly providing access to sensitive or proprietary NAU data. Account holders are responsible for setting appropriate access. The full policy, including limitations on support for some services, can be found in the Google support policy.
