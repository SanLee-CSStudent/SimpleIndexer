Pinal Promise! PreviousNext 12 Opening the doors of educational opportunity The Central Arizona College Foundation and Central Arizona College have worked together to open the doors of educational opportunity to more Pinal County students with Pinal Promise; a program developed exclusively for students who reside in and graduate from a high school in Pinal County. What is Pinal Promise? The Pinal Promise (formerly known as Promise for the Future) educational initiative was launched in 2001 by a caring community that believed that college should be a reality for every Pinal County student. This program was developed to encourage young people to stay in high school, graduate, and move on to a college or university. More than a twenty years later, the Promise continues with the original partnership of CAC Foundation, Central Arizona College, and Pinal County School Districts with a new focus on ease of access and equity for all Pinal County students. How does Pinal Promise impact students? Starting in Spring 2021, all students who reside in Pinal County and graduate from a Pinal County high school are eligible to receive two years of in-state tuition (fall\/spring, fall\/spring) funded by CAC and the CAC Foundation. This alleviates a huge financial burden for students who may not otherwise be able to attend college. Pinal Promise provides funding for any tuition need that has not been met. This means that Pinal Promise funds will be applied after all other Financial Aid has been applied to the student\u2019s account (this excludes student loans). Is my student eligible for Pinal Promise? Eligible student must: \u2013 Reside and graduate from a Pinal County high school (online high schools must have a physical presence in Pinal County). \u2013 Participate in 20 hours of community service that can be completed in high school or while attending CAC. \u2013 Click HERE to view additional guidelines and complete the CAC Scholarship application. MORE INFO ON HOW TO RECEIVE PINAL PROMISE FUNDING Frequently Asked Questions What if I have recently relocated to Pinal County as a senior. Will I still be eligible for Pinal Promise? Yes, as long as you reside and graduate from a Pinal County high school, you are eligible for Pinal Promise. When will I see the funds for Pinal Promise on my account? Pinal Promise funding occurs about a week after school starts for funding accuracy, but students are notified as soon as Financial Aid determines if they are eligible. Are home school students eligible? Home school students are not eligible for Pinal Promise. I remember signing something in 8th grade, is that still required? The 8th grade signing requirement has been eliminated (previous requirement under Promise for the Future). Is there any high school GPA requirement? No, there is no high school GPA requirement to be eligible to apply for Pinal Promise funds.
