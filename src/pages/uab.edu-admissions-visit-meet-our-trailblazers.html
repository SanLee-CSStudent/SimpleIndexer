Everything about UAB seemed forward thinking when I toured campus. With a young and growing environment with several resources, I knew UAB was the campus for me. Biggest college\/adult related fear you have overcome at UAB? Meeting new people! Being on campus has pushed me to welcome a range of new people and stories into my life. UAB is the perfect environment for this to occur in. Something I am looking forward to at UAB is I am looking forward to the several activities that happen on campus every year. The one thing I am most interested in is watching productions from our very own UAB theatre company...in-person!!! I\u2019m interested in Undergraduate Student Government Association, Hall Council I\u2019m passionate about experiencing Birmingham to the fullest and seeing the community that surrounds our wonderful campus. Bailey Anderson Bailey Anderson Junior Dothan, AL Dothan, AL Biomedical Engineering Biology and Chemistry Junior Connect Read more I chose UAB because I decided to attend UAB because of its nationally praised biomedical engineering program, as well as a variety of other reasons. As a prospective student, I really appreciated UAB\u2019s significant focus on undergraduate research across a variety of different fields, as I plan to participate in research in the near future. Additionally, as a student from a rural part of Alabama, I loved the \u201Cbig city feel\u201D that UAB projects. In fact, it truly feels like the city of Birmingham is the classroom. I also love the diversity of the student body, which encompasses students from different backgrounds, cultures, and countries across the world. Lastly, as a pre-medical student, I love the university\u2019s proximity to some of the nation\u2019s best medical facilities. This has allowed me to volunteer and gain extra-curricular experiences that fit into my future occupation. Favorite UAB tradition Gurney Derby Favorite thing to do in Birmingham? My favorite thing to do in Birmingham is trying all of the amazing restaurant options that the city has to offer. It feels like there are endless restaurant options across the city, and I love trying new food. Another thing that I enjoy doing in Birmingham is exploring places around the city such as Railroad Park, Birmingham Botanical Gardens, and the Vulcan. I\u2019m interested in UAB Ambassadors, SMART Leaders I\u2019m passionate about Student involvement and leadership, spending time outdoors, Chick-fil-A Kenya Barnes Kenya Barnes Sophomore Pensacola, FL Pensacola, FL Neuroscience Biomedical Sciences and Chemistry Sophomore Connect Read more I chose UAB because I wanted to go to a university that made me feel seen and accepted. From the minute I stepped on campus and talked to staff, physicians, and students, every person I came in contact with treated me as if I was family. UAB made me feel like it mattered what they could bring to me to help me succeed rather than asking what I could bring to them to help them succeed and having that dynamic was so important to me. It really is a university that makes you feel like family. I was also in search of a university that actually valued diversity and inclusion. I knew I needed to go to a school that would not make me feel like an imposter and UAB's expansive demographic did not disappoint. I've come to learn about so many other cultures since coming here in addition to further nurturing my own. The people here are all so accepting and I couldn't have asked for a better group of like-minded students and staff. Best thing you've ate in Birmingham? Brunch at Trattoria Zaza downtown (specifically the French Toast!), Coffee at Santos or Domestique\/Saturn, and dinner at New York Pizza in Homewood (the olive oil and garlic they put on the Margherita pizza is chef's kiss) Favorite thing to do in Birmingham? I love to go hiking at all of the various trails surrounding the city. There's literally mountains just steps off of campus and I love having that change of scenery right at my hands. It's a really nice de-stresser to have the opportunity to participate in on the weekends. I've also really enjoyed trying all of the numerous eateries around town. From late night ice cream trips, to early morning breakfast, Birmingham is really a foodie's dream. I\u2019m interested in UABMAPS (Minority Association of Pre-Health Students), Honors College, Alpha Epsilon Delta, undergraduate research I\u2019m passionate about Community service, equality and inclusion of medicine for those in underrepresented socioeconomic backgrounds, and all genres of music Andrew Bartholomew Andrew Bartholomew Senior Leavenworth, KS Leavenworth, KS Economics Mathematics and Military Science Senior Connect Read more Favorite thing to do in Birmingham Run around and explore the city including the Vulcan Trail, Rotary Trail, and Railroad Park Best class I've taken at UAB Honors Public Speaking, taught by Dr. Steve McCornack Something new I discovered at UAB I went to my first Hanukkah celebration. It was such a cool and inviting experience, and I left feeling closer to my peers and with an appreciation for how I get to meet so many cool people with different backgrounds. I\u2019m passionate about Exercise and nutrition&civic engagement&community building I\u2019m interested in Student Government&Social Justice Advocacy Council&TrailBlazers&Dodgeball Teams&Mock Trial Vianna Benjamin Vianna Benjamin Senior Gulfport, MS Gulfport, MS Biology STEM Education Senior Connect Read more I chose UAB because I was looking for a school that focused on research, diversity, and inclusivity in a great city. UAB was well known for all of that. When I stepped on campus, I instantly knew that this would be the school I would call home for the next few years as I pursue my dream of becoming a physician. Most surprising thing I\u2019ve learned or experienced at UAB I learned how to do a real push-up in my freshman honors seminar. Favorite UAB memory Playing Uno all night with students I met on the Campus Green when I first moved in. I\u2019m interested in Housing and Residence Life, Honors College I\u2019m passionate about Expressing myself through music, enjoy life, helping others Sumedha Bobba Sumedha Bobba Sophomore Madison, AL Madison, AL Neuroscience Philosophy Sophomore Connect Read more I chose UAB because I've found it's the perfect mix between a large and small university! It's large enough to where you can meet and make connections with people from all walks of life but small enough to where those connections are meaningful and won't be forgotten. Favorite thing to do in Birmingham? Thrift shopping and exploring the local food scene Best thing you've ate in Birmingham? Chicken shawarma pita from Falafel Cafe I\u2019m interested in Honors College, Greek Life, Neurobiology Research, Early Medical School Acceptance Program I\u2019m passionate about Equal Access to Education, Student Advocacy, Student Involvement Sukhmani Boparai Sukhmani Boparai Junior Jackson, TN Jackson, TN Neuroscience Chemistry and Spanish Junior Connect Read more I chose UAB because Initially I was interested in UAB because of the academic programs offered. However, as soon as I met the community at UAB, it became my top-choice college. I remember walking up the steps of Volker Hall for an interview. I was very nervous and uncomfortable in professional clothes, but as I ran up the stairs, someone yelled \u201Cgood luck\u201D to me from the street. At that moment I knew that UAB was the place for me because some random student took the time to say those words and to bring a smile to my face. Best thing I\u2019ve eaten in Birmingham The best thing I have gotten to eat, or actually drink, is boba tea. I had never had boba before attending UAB, but during my first break back home, I seriously was missing boba. I love that UAB is located in Birmingham because it\u2019s such a diverse city, which means there is a ton of food. I did not think about the different food that I would get to experience when choosing UAB, but I am so thankful for it now. Biggest college\/adult-related fear I\u2019ve overcome at UAB Accountability. Before coming to college, I had friends and family calling to give me advice. Most of the advice was about how to handle college, but one piece of advice that stood out to me was that I am now in control of my life. I don\u2019t think I truly understood the responsibility that comes with this control. I remember being afraid the first couple of months of my freshman year\u2014and, honestly, well before college actually started\u2014because I was making my own decisions. More importantly, the consequences of these decisions were my responsibility. Thus, I had to learn to be accountable. I did realize early on that I was accountable for the mistakes I made, but I think what I am learning to overcome\u2014and have overcome, to an extent\u2014is forgiving myself for making these mistakes. Instead of feeling guilty for staying up late one night to talk to friends instead of studying, I am learning to not only recognize that I am the only one to blame for this mistake but also that I can learn from this mistake. Rather than making myself feel worse, I believe I am learning how to hold myself accountable and to grow from an experience. I\u2019m passionate about Diversity in different forms. I really appreciate that UAB has a diverse community because I am able to learn so much from different people and recognize the many similarities present despite differences. I also am passionate about being able to pursue diverse interests. I believe this allows me to foster my interests as well as step outside of my comfort zone. I\u2019m interested in Dance (Birmingham's Blazin\u2019 Bhangra)&equal education rights (She's the First)&making a direct impact in the Birmingham community (KDSAP) Kasey Cameron Kasey Cameron Junior Alabaster, AL Alabaster, AL Biomedical Sciences Junior Connect Read more I chose UAB because UAB offers a tight-knit family that is dedicated to excellence in a manner I have never seen before. Everybody here wants you to succeed and excel at the next level. The focus UAB puts on creating an environment that allows us as students to be so diverse yet feel like we are all united as a blazer family is why I chose UAB. Favorite thing to do in Birmingham Go to the Summit. Good food. Good shopping. Easy choice. Something I\u2019m looking forward to at UAB Continuing to grow as a person and as a future health-care professional. I am excited to continue my education and continue to connect with my peers and develop relationships that last far beyond May 2023. I\u2019m passionate about My family, faith, and anything pertaining to people. I love being around and connecting with people. I\u2019m interested in TrailBlazers&Honors College&BMD program Chandler Compton Chandler Compton Senior Moulton, AL Moulton, AL Kinesiology Senior Connect Read more Favorite thing to do in Birmingham? I love being in the city and exploring. Birmingham has so many things to offer and I love getting to experience all of it whether it be food, art, shopping, or music. Best class you have taken at UAB? I absolutely love my nutrition and consumer class. Describe something new you tried or did at UAB and how it made you feel. I played spike ball for the first time on the green on a sunny afternoon and the sun started to set. It was a beautiful day and I had so much fun playing spike ball. I really got into it and want to play all the time now. I\u2019m interested in Traveling. On campus I am interested in the nutrition club, USGA, campus outreach, and coins for cancer. I\u2019m passionate about God, art, food, and people. Tyrek Cunningham Tyrek Cunningham Sophomore Satsuma, AL Satsuma, AL Nursing Sophomore Connect Read more I chose UAB because It\u2019s diversity that is like nothing I\u2019ve experienced in my time as a student prior to college. Favorite UAB tradition? UAB\u2019s homecoming game is always so much fun. Students are often busy in the fall getting back into class, and I have often can\u2019t make it to every home football game, but homecoming seems to be the exception. Everyone from freshmen to decades old alumni come to watch our boys play which is always so much fun. Favorite thing to do in Birmingham? Scooting around downtown at night with friends. I\u2019m interested in UAB Tennis Club. I\u2019m passionate about Travel, tennis, and good eats.

I\u2019m interested in Delta Gamma I\u2019m passionate about Helping others and making people happy Ami Dave Ami Dave Junior Suwanee, GA Suwanee, GA Public Health Chemistry Junior Connect Read more I chose UAB because Because of the opportunity, diversity, and challenges found here. There's always something on campus that pushes you to be a better version of yourself through the classes you take, people you meet, and opportunities present. Favorite thing to do in Birmingham Going to the WBRC sign at The Club and looking at the city. Favorite UAB tradition The Homecoming parade I\u2019m passionate about Ensuring that individuals have equal access to resources like education and health care, no matter who they are or where they are from I\u2019m interested in Student government&Global and Community Leadership Honors Program&Indian Cultural Association&Social and Justice Advocacy Council&Blazer Spirit Council Teddy Dowd Teddy Dowd Junior Dothan, AL Dothan, AL Biomedical Sciences Spanish Junior Connect Read more Biggest college\/adult-related fear I\u2019ve overcome at UAB One of my biggest fears coming to UAB was meeting people because I was one of very few kids coming to this university from my high school. I quickly overcame this fear as I got more involved with other students and organizations on campus. The community here at UAB is so friendly and welcoming. On top of that, it is so easy to get involved. There are vast opportunities for students to find something that interests them. Through these opportunities, students can then meet so many other people with the same interests and goals. I now know that I can always turn to my friends here at UAB for encouragement or advice. The people that I have built relationships with on campus have become some the closest people in my entire life. Growing up, I was always told that I would meet my closest friends in college, and this statement holds true for me and my time at UAB. Something new I discovered at UAB All through high school, I played soccer for my school and club team. Coming to UAB, I knew I would miss being on a team, but I also knew that I wanted to stay active and get involved with sports here, whether it be club or intramural. After getting to campus, a resident assistant invited me to come play ultimate Frisbee with the club team one day. I instantly fell in love and joined the team. UAB Club Ultimate Frisbee is something I never would have guessed I would have tried or gotten involved in. Being part of the team during my freshman year was an awesome experience. I love being a part of the team and building close relationships with the other guys. Frisbee is also a great stress reliever from all my other academics and extracurriculars. I'm so happy I gave ultimate Frisbee a shot, and I look forward to my future time on the team. What UAB means to me UAB to me is opportunity. Whether that opportunity relates to academics, extracurriculars, or your social life, UAB has so much to offer. I'm interested in medicine, and UAB offers so many good chances for a pre-med student like myself to get prepared for the MCAT, medical school, and a career as a doctor. These pre-med opportunities show in many different ways. One opportunity is shadowing or volunteering at the various hospitals surrounding the undergraduate campus. UAB also makes it very easy for its students to get involved in good lab research that genuinely interests them. Finally, UAB has so many leadership organizations for students to get involved in. Other than academic and pre-med opportunities, UAB's community also allows students to build strong, long-lasting relationships with other people. UAB is full of opportunity, and these opportunities show in many different shapes and sizes and are easily available to students if they pursue them. I\u2019m passionate about servant leadership I\u2019m interested in USGA&Club Ultimate Frisbee&intramural sports Taylor England Taylor England Senior Odenville, AL Odenville, AL Psychology Senior Connect Read more Favorite thing to do in Birmingham Try new food.

I\u2019m passionate about fitness&reading I\u2019m interested in Greek life&undergraduate research&the psychology honors program Annie Ensor Annie Ensor Senior Sikeston, MO Sikeston, MO Neuroscience Senior Connect Read more Favorite thing to do in Birmingham Going out and trying new restaurants with my friends. I chose UAB because The educational and social experiences and opportunities that are present at UAB and throughout the city of Birmingham. What UAB means to me UAB is my home away from home. It\u2019s a place where I have found my independence and met some of my closest friends. This university is one of the best preparations for my future, educationally and through my own personal developments. I\u2019m passionate about Being able to help those around me and always trying to make the best of any situation I\u2019m interested in Honors College&undergraduate research&Greek life Sharon Gallegos Sharon Gallegos Junior Fort Payne, AL Fort Payne, AL Biomedical Sciences Junior Connect Read more Favorite thing to do in Birmingham?

Ethan George Ethan George Junior Lawrenceville, GA Lawrenceville, GA Neuroscience Psychology and Chemistry Junior Connect Read more I chose UAB because The opportunity the university provides along with the diversity on campus. Favorite UAB memory My favorite memory so far comes from the beginning of freshman year, when I got to meet a lot of new, welcoming, and passionate people. Something new I discovered at UAB I wanted to be more outgoing, so I joined organizations and applied to leadership positions. I'm so glad I decided to put myself out there, because I got to meet so many new people. This is how I became a TrailBlazer. I'm excited to keep trying new things throughout my time at UAB. I\u2019m passionate about making people smile I\u2019m interested in USGA Mary Gilmore Mary Gilmore Junior Helena, AL Helena, AL Public Health Junior Connect Read more Best class I\u2019ve taken at UAB So far it has been a core English literature class. I wasn't too excited about having to take another English, but professor Joey Kennedy made the class interesting and fulfilling. Every class that I walked out of, I can confidently say I took something away from it\u2014more than just literature, and that's the reality here at UAB. Your professors are here to support you while enriching your learning experience, and that's why at UAB, any class has the potential to be your favorite class. Best thing I've eaten in Birmingham Pho at a restaurant at the Pizitz Food Hall. Pho is the best. Most surprising thing I\u2019ve learned or experienced at UAB A sense of community and belonging. The university is the perfect size to feel small enough that you can see the same people and create your own communities, but large enough that you can continuously meet new people and make new relationships. There is something for everyone here. I\u2019m passionate about helping my community I\u2019m interested in USGA&School of Public Health&Greek life&Honors College Montana Henderson Montana Henderson Sophomore Priceville, AL Priceville, AL Mechanical Engineering Sophomore Connect Read more I chose UAB because It offers me a diverse, welcoming collegiate experience all while nestled into the beautiful metropolitan setting of Birmingham. Best thing you've ate in Birmingham? Lunch at Falafel Caf?. You have to try their chicken pitas. My dream is to learn how to cook food as savory as them. What does UAB mean to you?

Best thing I\u2019ve eaten in Birmingham Hattie B's hot chicken. Seriously, it's the best. I chose UAB because It is not only a school but a community of passionate and hardworking students and faculty whose work goes way beyond the university's boundaries. At UAB, you aren't just a number. You're a part of the Blazer family where everyone wants you to succeed just as much as you want to yourself. UAB is undoubtedly a place that cultivates success, providing opportunities for students of all backgrounds and pursuits to truly be the best they can be.

Weezer killed it. Best thing I\u2019ve eaten in Birmingham The best thing has got to be the brunch mystery bowl at Black Market in Five Points. The mystery bowl is basically just a random assortment of breakfast foods that the chef chooses on the spot. It's always delicious and never the same. Something I\u2019m looking forward to at UAB I'm looking forward to the very first Blazer football game I get to watch in the soon-to-open Protective Stadium. I\u2019m passionate about board games&music&the great outdoors I\u2019m interested in Greek life&UAB Habitat Club&UAB Ambassadors&Honors College Michael Ho Michael Ho Senior Chattanooga, TN Chattanooga, TN French and Neuroscience Chemistry Senior Connect Read more Best class I\u2019ve taken at UAB French-Speaking Cinema. Really opened up my traditionally scientific perspective to the world that is larger than cellular processes. I was able to dive into French culture and critically analyze old films from the 1940s and 1950s and see their cultural significance in contemporary French film. Most surprising thing I\u2019ve learned or experienced at UAB I have come to embrace my artistic side, which I never really knew I had. In studying French and attending various philosophy seminars, I\u2019ve been able to truly broaden my horizons and find a new passion in exploring different cultures and artworks. Biggest college\/adult-related fear I\u2019ve overcome at UAB Prior to coming to UAB, I was nervous and anxious as to how exactly I'd manage my schedule, coming from a high school that had fairly rigid class structures. However, as I've grown in my own independence and adulthood, I've truly enjoyed getting to map out my own day-to-day schedule and keep myself responsible by adhering to that. I\u2019m passionate about chasing waterfalls&thrift shopping&rural health care I\u2019m interested in USGA&Ambassadors&AED (pre-health organization)&UAB Honors College Reilyn Intemann Reilyn Intemann Senior Fort Mill, SC Fort Mill, SC Nursing Senior Connect Read more I chose UAB because It was the perfect fit. I could never put it into words because it is so different from what I said I wanted when I was touring schools, but when I stepped on campus, it felt like home, and everyone immediately became my community and family. I continue to choose the opportunity and diversity that are on campus and in the city as well as the amazing medical facilities and staff that have quite literally been my lifesavers. Best thing I've eaten in Birmingham Yo\u2019 Mama\u2019s chicken and waffles (gluten free, of course)\u2014good old Southern cooking by the sweetest ladies. Biggest college\/adult-related fear I\u2019ve overcome at UAB Doing things without my parents. Whether it is going to doctor\u2019s appointments or traveling home, I wasn't used to doing these things alone, and it was really intimidating at first. Last spring I was going through a really rough patch with a heart condition, and it was the first time I had to really advocate for myself. I\u2019m passionate about Sharing my love for the place I have now made home with prospective students and helping them find their #uabwhy. I\u2019m interested in Honors College&volunteering with children&Dance Marathon Abhi Kamath Abhi Kamath Junior Hoover, AL Hoover, AL Neuroscience Philosophy Junior Connect Read more I chose UAB because This is the college where I would learn and grow into the best individual I can be. Birmingham is the city I grew up in. My parents have always worked in Birmingham, and as a child, I would always go to downtown or UAB for summer camps. In high school, I spent every summer at UAB doing research or volunteering, and I witnessed all the accomplishments, the change, and advancements UAB made. I knew that UAB was the college where I would have the brightest future and have the resources and help to accomplish my goals as a person and as a student. The culmination of growth, diversity and inclusion, genuine mentorship, and truly unique opportunities presented by UAB makes this campus truly unparalleled in student possibilities compared to any other school I visited. Favorite UAB tradition Homecoming week. The week started off with the Blazer Showdown, where I got to watch all my friends dance in a competition. The next day they brought out one of my favorite comedians, Trevor Wallace, to do a stand-up show, and I got to meet him! The Gurney Derby is a UAB classic that I think everyone has to see or take part in to really understand how intense it is. Then I got the chance to march in the parade and see everyone at UAB, from staff to researchers to graduate students. And to end the week, of course we had the tailgate and football game. It is by far the most fun week of the year. Biggest college\/adult-related fear I\u2019ve overcome at UAB One of my biggest fears was how I was going to get involved in organizations in college. At first, I felt this rush to join everything as soon as possible, but my advisors helped put everything into perspective for me. They laid out what my four years at UAB would look like and showed me just how much time I would have to discover my true interests before joining different organizations. They also showed me how a lot of the bigger organizations on campus open up applications in the spring semester rather than in the fall. Because of their help, I spent most of the first semester really enjoying college, making friends and having fun, and discovering my true passions and the best organizations to fulfill those passions (which I eventually joined in the spring). With the help of my advisors, I feel like I made the most out of my freshman year without missing out on campus involvement. I\u2019m passionate about Tennis&Basketball&Medicine&Research I\u2019m interested in Early Medical School Acceptance Program&Science and Technology Honors Program&Senator for the Undergraduate Student Government Association&Neurobiology Research Kian Kolahdouzan Kian Kolahdouzan Sophomore Madison, MS Madison, MS Neuroscience Chemistry Sophomore Connect Read more Best class you have taken at UAB?

Favorite UAB memory The snow day of 2021. Everyone came out and had a big snowball fight. There were snowmen everywhere, and it was also nice not to have classes that day. I\u2019m interested in Student Government, Personalized Honors College I\u2019m passionate about Research, Fitness and Nutrition, Learning, Soccer Ania Krutul Ania Krutul Senior Fairhope, AL Fairhope, AL Economics Mathematics Senior Connect Read more Favorite UAB tradition Touching the paw of the Blaze statue outside of Collat for good luck before big days and exams. Best class I've taken at UAB An honors cinema class where I was able to watch movies that are staples within our culture and learn about the importance of storytelling within film. What UAB means to me UAB means so much more than a university. UAB means being outspoken, confident, and unapologetically unique. It means being respected and accepted while being challenged and questioned. It means innovation, progress, and, most importantly, family. I\u2019m passionate about Sustainability&human rights&good food I\u2019m interested in Students for Human Rights&USGA&Honors College John Ellis Kuykendall John Ellis Kuykendall Sophomore Tuscaloosa, AL Tuscaloosa, AL Biology Chemistry and Business Administration Sophomore Connect Read more Favorite UAB tradition The Homecoming parade.

That was when I knew UAB was where I wanted to be. Biggest college\/adult-related fear I\u2019ve overcome at UAB I was super nervous about not knowing what to major in. I knew I was on the pre-medicine track, but I had no idea what to study. I ended up realizing I had time to figure it out, and it would be OK. I\u2019m passionate about Helping people become the best version of themselves they can be. My biggest goal is to always be helpful and to become the president of the United States one day. I\u2019m interested in Lots of things on campus. One organization I love to work with is the Honors College, where I serve as an ambassador. Darby Lyndall Darby Lyndall Sophomore Ocean Springs, MS Ocean Springs, MS Nursing Sophomore Connect Read more I chose UAB because UAB felt like home. Immediately when I come here, I feel at peace, and that was something I wanted to hold on to. Favorite UAB tradition? Blazer Thunder at football and basketball games Biggest college\/adult related fear you have overcome at UAB? I have learned that in order to find myself, I have to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, and it\u2019s been the best lesson I\u2019ve ever learned! Because of this, I have become more independent and comfortable with being alone. I\u2019m interested in Reformed University Fellowship (RUF) I\u2019m passionate about Using my experiences to help other people through theirs. Danna Mahdi Danna Mahdi Junior Huntsville, AL Huntsville, AL Health Care Management Chemistry Junior Connect Read more I chose UAB because UAB was always my goal throughout my time in high school. I always visited UAB when my eldest sister went here and I fell in love with it every time I came. As I got older I started looking at UAB in a more serious sense and I had a huge appreciation for the diversity on campus. I tend to stand out because of my hijab but visiting UAB made me feel like I fit in somewhere, regardless of how different I am. I ultimately chose UAB because I truly felt I\u2019d be happy here. Best thing you've ate in Birmingham? The brown sugar milk tea boba at Kokee Tea. I\u2019m absolutely obsessed with it. Most surprising thing you have learned or experienced at UAB? I genuinely had no idea how many academic and campus life resources we have at our disposal. It\u2019s honestly amazing. Anything I could need, UAB has something to help me. If I need help with writing I can go to the writing center. If I need a tutor I can go to the VMASC. If I need to get across campus and I don\u2019t want to walk I can take the Blazer Express. There\u2019s so much more and we have access to all of this just by being students at UAB. I\u2019m interested in TrailBlazers, Pre-Dental Honors Society, Alpha Lambda Delta Honors Society I\u2019m passionate about Reading (I spend a lot of time on BookTok), Social Justice, Mental Health Jaden Mosley Jaden Mosley Sophomore Marietta, GA Marietta, GA Biomedical Sciences Sophomore Connect Read more I chose UAB because Aside from the beautiful campus and the opportunities that come with being surrounded by hospitals, UAB was the first place that instantly felt like home to me. I could actually picture myself walking through the green to class or getting lunch with my friends at the hill. I just knew it was where I was meant to be. Favorite thing to do in Birmingham? My friends and I always go out for ice cream at night, sometimes it\u2019s DQ but recently it\u2019s been a place called Big Spoon which has cinnamon toast ice cream (so delicious), and then we go to a place called the \u201COverlook\u201D. It\u2019s at the top of a hill in this huge subdivision and it\u2019s one of the best views of the city. The funny part is that it doesn\u2019t have an actual address and I don\u2019t even know how to get there, so it\u2019s like a cool hidden spot. I feel like I\u2019m on top of the world whenever I\u2019m there. Best class you have taken at UAB? My first semester I took a dialogue based honors seminar on race\/racism. The first half of the semester we did a lot of reading and learning about not only racism in America, but also how to effectively dialogue about such a tough subject. For the rest of the semester, we dug into the nuances and subtleties of racism and I can say that everyone in that class came away with a better understanding of race in America. This class was super important to me because it helped me become more comfortable in my own identity and taught me how to talk to people about issues that matter. Both of my professors for that class were amazing and I recommend everyone to take that seminar. I\u2019m interested in MAPS (Minority Association of Pre-Health Students) I\u2019m passionate about The number one thing I\u2019m passionate about is helping people in any capacity that I can. I went to a middle school where the majority of students came from low income families, so in high school I was heavily focused on the cause of housing for low income families, specifically through Habitat for Humanity. Everyone deserves to have a place to call home and that\u2019s something that I hope to continue to work towards at UAB.

Something new I discovered at UAB This is probably super nerdy, and I've made my peace with that, but at UAB I've gotten to play Dungeons and Dragons with some really close friends, and as someone who grew up doing theater but isn't doing it anymore, it's honestly one of the highlights of my week. It\u2019s definitely filling up the theater-sized hole in my heart.

The way we uplift and support the Bham community is amazing and a lot of students who intern or work at the hospitals are directly benefiting Birmingham citizens. It's something I couldn't find anywhere else, the way UAB loves its city. Favorite thing to do in Birmingham? Going to Railroad park to picnic as the sun sets! Its a gorgeous time of day and you get to see the Alabama Theater light up as the sun goes down and reflects off of the sky scrapers. Favorite UAB memory? The water balloon fight on The Green!

Remy Stuckey Remy Stuckey Senior Huntsville, AL Huntsville, AL Genetics and Genomic Sciences Senior Connect Read more Favorite thing to do in Birmingham Explore. I have been visiting Birmingham my whole life and lived here for two years, and I am always being introduced to something new. Birmingham is a big food city, so I love trying out new and popular restaurants of all kinds. I am also a huge coffee person, and this city has no shortage of amazing coffee shops. I've made it my mission to try as many as possible. Finally, I love the outdoors. Although Birmingham is urban, there are parks and hiking trails everywhere. Each time I go somewhere new, I get to see a whole different view of the city. Best class I've taken at UAB The best was a molecular genetics class that I took my freshman year. It was a research-based course that was centered around hands-on laboratory work. My classmates and I were able to work with the Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute to learn more about rare genetic diseases in humans. Then we spent the semester using different tools to modify the genes of zebrafish to reflect these diseases. It was really amazing to be able to do that research as a freshman and see results. We were even able to present our work at the UAB Expo for undergraduate research. Opportunities like these are one of the reasons I chose UAB. Biggest college\/adult-related fear I\u2019ve overcome at UAB Asking for help. As an \"adult\" entering college, I felt like I was supposed to have it all together and be completely independent. I ultimately realized that this was not the case. There was a lot I didn\u2019t know, especially when it came to furthering my education and experiences outside of the classroom. It took me until my sophomore year to finally reach out to faculty and advisors for guidance, and I wish I had done it sooner. These people helped guide me toward research opportunities and even a master\u2019s program. If you\u2019re ever feeling lost or unsure, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help, even if it\u2019s not academic, and there will be someone more than willing to help you along the way. I\u2019m passionate about Good coffee. One of my favorite things about Birmingham is its abundance of unique\u2014and amazing\u2014coffee shops. My goal is to visit as many as possible and find the best coffee shop in town.&On a more serious note, I am also passionate about empowering others to feel supported in their goals and in the pursuit of such. Choosing a potential career and pursuing a path in college can be difficult and confusing, but with the support and encouragement of others, I think it can be a lot of fun. I'm thankful that UAB and everyone involved have created that supportive community for students.

I got to participate in countless fun activities on campus like the parade, the football game, and much more. At the end of the week, I got to see one of my favorite bands, Weezer, right on the Green. That\u2019s my favorite memory because I knew I chose the right place for my second home. What UAB means to me UAB means a second home to me. I have no problem calling it my second home because of how comfortable and free I feel on campus. I have amazing friends and classmates that always encourage me to be my best self in and out of the classroom.
