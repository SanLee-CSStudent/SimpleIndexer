Jerry was a daily part of life at Arkansas Tech in the mid-1930s. He was owned by William O. Young, who served as business manager for Arkansas Tech from 1917-42 and acted as interim president of the college from 1923-25; and his son, Robert A. Young Sr., who grew up to serve as purchasing agent, business manager, vice president for business affairs and vice president for administration for Arkansas Tech from 1941-84 and as interim president in 1972. Jerry's past Jerry spent much of his time on campus at the armory (now known as the Stroupe Building) with National Guard Battery F. The students and guardsmen there adopted Jerry as if he was their own. Reports from an Arka Tech student newspaper article of the era say that Jerry exhibited \u201Cdetermination\u201D and that his only bad habit seemed to be a fondness for chewing on shoes. The Feb. 26, 1936, article went on to state that Jerry was \u201Calways present at anything of importance at the armory,\u201D which was a social center of campus at that time and the site of Arkansas Tech home basketball games. When Jerry passed away in late 1937, the headline in the Arka Tech proclaimed \u201CCampus Loses Mascot in Passing of Jerry.\u201D Now, Jerry is back. Jerry now Jerry represents an admirable characteristic that has defined Arkansas Tech for more than 100 years --- persistence. Jerry\u2019s never-say-die attitude is reflected in the way Arkansas Tech has persevered through tough times. Jerry\u2019s spirit lives inside the Tech students who overcome every obstacle to realize the life-changing benefits of a college education. Jerry\u2019s competitive drive is exemplified by the efforts of Wonder Boys and Golden Suns student-athletes on the fields and courts of play. The intercollegiate athletics teams at Arkansas Tech will continue to be known by their historically significant nicknames --- Wonder Boys and Golden Suns. Jerry says Fight On! guidelines APPEARANCE REQUESTS Since making his return to the Tech family in 2013, Jerry the Bulldog has reclaimed the prominent place he held in the hearts and minds of the campus community more than 80 years ago.
