Be a part of UAB. Your individuality makes UAB distinguished. At UAB, we want you to be yourself because the fabric of our campus is made up of so many different people, backgrounds, and stories. Together, we make up one campus. A campus that is resilient. Diverse. Energetic. Beautiful. Everything we could want our UAB campus to be. Sports We have a long history of winning at UAB. But we\u2019re about to take Blazer athletics to another level. We\u2019ve got a brand new, state-of-the-art football stadium taking shape downtown. And hoops legend Andy Kennedy recently took over our men\u2019s basketball program with serious visions of playing deep into March. Every year. Yep, our sports teams are about to make some noise. And if you\u2019re a Blazer fan, it\u2019s time for you to come make some with us. College City Sometimes it\u2019s easy to forget you\u2019re in the heart of a city when you\u2019re hanging out on an expansive Campus Green. Or doing homework underneath one of our campus\u2019s 4,400+ trees. Or strolling to class from your conveniently located on-campus home. Well, the nearby nightlife, world-renowned restaurants, skyscrapers, arts scene, and business opportunities in Birmingham might remind you. Every day. Diversity Like we said, our campus is made up of many different people of all sorts of backgrounds. In fact, our programs attract people from all over the world. Whether you\u2019re interested in health care, business, the arts, research, law, technology, or almost anything else, chances are we have a line of study for you. And your unique perspective makes our campus a better place. No wonder we\u2019ve been named a Diversity Champion by INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine. In Your Corner You\u2019re never alone at UAB.
