IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION The Bachelor of Science in Education degree in elementary education provides a strong foundation for students wanting to teach kindergarten through sixth grade. This 120-hour program provides graduates with a comprehensive understanding of teaching young learners and of the need for a learning environment that is responsive to students\u2019 developmental needs. ASK AN ADVISOR MAKE AN ADVISING APPOINTMENT WHY SHOULD YOU BECOME AN ELEMENTARY EDUCATOR? Your Chance to Change the World Students and faculty in the Elementary Education Program envision a world in which all children are equally encouraged and enabled to develop their interests and talents; a world where teachers represent the best efforts and hopes of the societies they serve and are respected for the importance of their work. Elementary educators are fundamental to helping children navigate the world around them by showing students that learning is relevant, useful, fun, and important. A good teacher has the chance to change the lives of their students, but also to help them co-create a pathway to limitless possibilities and opportunities. Incredible Job Security and Opportunities for Advancement While the licensure requirements vary from state to state, teachers who have established a good work ethic and reputation don\u2019t have to worry too much about finding a job. Because teachers are in such high demand across the United States, you have almost guaranteed job security\u2014especially kindergarten and elementary school teaching positions which are expected to increase by 7% by 2024 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Education is probably one of the best fields for advancement because the possibilities are endless. You have the opportunity to not only guide new and experienced teachers through Lead Teacher appointments and mentorship programs, but also to shape the educational environment by becoming a curriculum specialist (math, literacy, special education, gifted and talented, etc.), guidance counselor, assistant principal, principal, or district level administrator. Five Steps to Begin Your Teaching Career in Elementary Education STEP 1: Satisfy Core Requirements Complete all University Core requirements or an associate\u2019s degree with a cumulative GPA of 2.7. STEP 2: Apply for Admission Fill out the online admissions application and submit the required materials to the UA Little Rock Office of Admissions. STEP 3: Submit Test Scores Submit your admission test scores to your advisor. STEP 4: Complete Background Check Process Before you can be placed in a school for your field experiences or internship, you must have an approved background check in the Arkansas Educator Licensure System (AELS). Please contact the Director of Licensure and Placement for directions to complete this process. STEP 5: Complete the Child Maltreatment Training Before you can be placed in a school for your field experiences or internship, you must complete your Child Maltreatment Mandated Reporter training. Once you have completed the 60-90 minutes of self-paced training you should download your certificate of completion and store it in your files for future use and licensure. WHAT YOU\u2019LL STUDY Our Elementary Education Program is committed to encouraging students from various backgrounds to pursue an interest in the field with the intention of providing diverse teachers to meet the needs of diverse communities across the state and region. Our mission is aligned with the overall goals of the professional societies that devote their efforts to improving the lives of children in the broadest sense, realizing that children\u2019s mental growth does not occur independent of the cultures, families, political, and economic conditions within which they exist. Our faculty believe that enhancing the lives of children within this context will ultimately nurture competent citizens for our community and society as well as the world. Admission, Program, and Graduation Requirements Apply for Undergraduate Admission to UA Little Rock Visit apply.ualr.edu to complete an application for undergraduate admission and submit the $40 non-refundable application fee. Applicants with fewer than 12 transferable college credit hours should request that an official high school transcript or GED scores be sent to the Office of Admissions. Only official transcripts will be accepted and must be submitted in a sealed, stamped envelope from the issuing institution or sent via electronic data interchange from the high school. Applicants with fewer than 12 transferable college credit hours may need to request official ACT or SAT scores from the testing agency (UA Little Rock ACT Code 0132; UA Little Rock SAT code 6368) if the official high school transcript does not include scores and s\/he did not indicate UA Little Rock as a score recipient at the time of testing. ACT, SAT, COMPASS or Accuplacer scores must be from tests taken within the last five Students have the option of taking the Accuplacer test available through UA Little Rock Testing Services. Any applicant previously enrolled at another institution(s) must request that an official college transcript(s) be sent to the Office of Admissions. Only official transcripts will be accepted, and must be submitted in a sealed, stamped envelope from the issuing institution or sent via electronic data interchange from the previous institution. Students may submit an official \u201CIn Progress\u201D transcript from the institution at which s\/he is currently enrolled for admission purposes, but will still be required to submit a final, official transcript once all grades have been posted. Freshmen who completed high school concurrent credit at an institution other than UA Little Rock must submit an official college transcript. Students born after January 1, 1957, must submit proof of two MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) immunizations. For more detailed information regarding admission requirements, please review the Undergraduate Catalog or visit the UA Little Rock Office of Admissions website. Transfer Student Admission Transfer students must be academically advised before registering for classes. Students who are undecided on a major are advised in the Office of Undergraduate Academic Advising. Students who have decided on a major should make an appointment with an advisor in the academic department offering the major. Students may potentially enroll in UA Little Rock courses prior to final transcript credit articulation. Transfer credit articulation is an ongoing process that can only be completed once a student submits all final transfer credits and the credits are posted to the UA Little Rock transcript. Because transfer credit articulation impacts course placement and registration, transfer students with a provisional admission status may need registration overrides into core, major, or minor courses during the first semester on campus. The process of transfer credit articulation may take several weeks at minimum to process after a student has been fully admitted to UA Little Rock. For more details regarding transfer credits, please review the Undergraduate Catalog or visit the Transfer Student Services website. Community College Transfers Students transferring to UA Little Rock from two-year colleges are subject to these provisions. Students must first consult with Academic Advising to articulate transfer coursework prior to being admitted to the College Humanities, Arts, Social Sciences, and Education.

Opportunities to Work During Your Internship Undergraduate students in traditional licensure programs may earn income working in K-12 schools during their internships through the following opportunities. Any student enrolled in a School of Education program who would like to complete their internship as a paraprofessional or substitute teacher must first have the approval of their Program Coordinator, the Director of Teacher Licensure and Placement, and the Director of the School of Education. Paraprofessional Position Interns may apply for open paraprofessional positions in any K-12 school in the state. Students must meet the hiring school\u2019s requirements for a paraprofessional, which often can include holding an associate\u2019s degree or completing 60 hours of undergraduate course work. Some schools may ask their paraprofessionals to complete the ParaPro Assessment as well. Interns enrolled in the Elementary Education and Middle Childhood Education programs must work as instructional or academic paraprofessionals in classrooms that meet the requirements of the internships in which they are enrolled each semester. For these programs, a paraprofessional position in a Special Education classroom will not meet program and licensure requirements. Interns enrolled in the Special Education program may only work as Special Education paraprofessionals under the supervision of licensed special educators. Their paraprofessional positions must meet the grade level and disability level of the internships in which they are enrolled each semester. While it is unlikely that students enrolled in the Education Minor program will be able to find instructional or academic paraprofessional positions in their content area and at their grade level, they may also work as paraprofessionals during internship if the position matches the requirements of the internship course. Substitute Position Please contact Heather Newsam for the most up-to-date information given the recent changes at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education continue.
