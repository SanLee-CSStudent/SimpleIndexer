Wyoming Board of Professional Engineers and Professional Land Surveyors Dr. Sam Heintz, Chair of the Department of Engineering-Physics Department of Nursing Southern Arkansas University (SAU) discloses that Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program will fulfill state educational requirements for professional RN licenses. State licensing boards of nursing may require additional requirements beyond education (i.e. application and licensing fees, criminal background checks, fingerprint submissions, continuing education hours, etc.). It is up to you to review and understand additional requirements prior to enrolling in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs. State licensing boards may change requirements depending on current trends and issues in nursing practice. Therefore, it is recommended you inquire with the applicable state board of nursing to confirm eligibility for licensure prior to enrolling in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs. We encourage you to contact the licensing board directly of the state should you have a question concerning requirements for licensure within that state. Relocating to another state may affect your eligibility of requirements for licensure. Contact the agency where you seek licensure before relocating to ensure you will be eligible for licensure in that state. If you are relocating to another state, make sure you review the educational prerequisites for your intended state of licensure. Make sure our BSN program educational requirements meet your desired state licensure requirements. Use the agency contact information provided below to guide you in the review process for clarity of requirements. SAU has not made a determination that its curriculum meets the education requirements for other state boards of nursing. Students pursuing licensure should be aware of the specific requirements for each state. Resources for students inquiring about educational requirements for professional licenses.
