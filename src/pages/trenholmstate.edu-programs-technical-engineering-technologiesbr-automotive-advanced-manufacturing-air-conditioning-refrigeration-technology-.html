Apply Now! What is Air Conditioning & Refrigeration? Heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration mechanics and installers, often called HVACR technicians, work on heating, ventilation, cooling, and refrigeration systems that control the temperature and air quality in buildings. Heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration mechanics and installers typically do the following: Install, clean, and maintain HVACR systems Install electrical components and wiring Inspect and test HVACR systems and components Discuss system malfunctions with customers Repair or replace worn or defective parts Recommend maintenance to improve system performance Keep records of work performed Heating and air conditioning systems control the temperature, humidity, and overall air quality in homes, businesses, and other buildings. By providing a climate-controlled environment, refrigeration systems make it possible to store and transport food, medicine, and other perishable items. Some HVACR technicians specialize in one or more specific aspects of HVACR, such as radiant heating systems, solar panels, testing and balancing, or commercial refrigeration. When installing or repairing air conditioning and refrigeration systems, technicians must follow government regulations regarding the conservation, recovery, and recycling of refrigerants. The regulations include those concerning the proper handling and disposal of fluids and pressurized gases. Our Mission The Air Conditioning and Refrigeration program at Trenholm State Community College is designed to promote and cultivate a high-quality education of the principles involved in the service, maintenance, and installation of HVACR systems. It is envisioned that through the various courses, students will gain both technical knowledge as well as practical hands-on experience that will aid them to transition into qualified technicians, ready to enter the workforce in the HVACR industry.
