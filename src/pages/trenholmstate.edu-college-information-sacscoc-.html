Reaffirmation Timeline December 2016 TSCC's Leadership Team attended SACSCOC's Reaffirmation of Accreditation Orientation March 2018 Compliance Certification and Institutional Summary due April 24-27, 2018 Off-Site Peer Review conducted August 28, 2018 Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), Focused Report, and updated Institutional Summary Form due October 9-11, 2018 On-Site Peer Review conducted June 2019 Review by SACSCOC Board of Trustees Quality Enhancement Plan Executive Summary H. Councill Trenholm State Community College\u2019s (Trenholm State\u2019s) proposed Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), \u201CRaising the Bar for Math Success,\u201D will focus on enhancing student learning and success in developmental mathematics. The process of selecting the QEP theme was designed to be open and include all college stakeholders, with a continued focus on ensuring the topic was aligned with Trenholm State\u2019s mission and connected to its strategic plan. After several campus-wide meetings and review of institutional research related to student learning and performance outcomes, the QEP Committee identified the topic of most relevance and need to improve student learning and overall achievement. Institutional data and performance trends highly informed this decision. In spring 2017, for instance, 80.7 percent of first-time college students entering Trenholm State were placed in developmental mathematics. Furthermore, data revealed that completion rates for students in developmental mathematics during fall 2014, 2015, and 2016 ranged from a low of 54.9 percent to a high of 75 percent. The proposed QEP is designed to meet the needs of developmental math students and move them successfully through remediation not only faster, but prepared to succeed in college-level coursework. The QEP goals and student learning outcomes will serve as the foundation for assessing the impact of the QEP implementation strategies. QEP Goals Goal 1: Decrease the percentage of students placing into developmental mathematics by providing intervention activities prior to enrollment Goal 2: For students who place in developmental mathematics, increase the percentage of students enrolled in developmental mathematics during their first semester Goal 3: Increase success rates of students participating in developmental mathematics Goal 4: Increase retention of students participating in developmental mathematics Goal 5: Increase the percentage of students completing developmental mathematics who successfully complete the program capstone course (MTH100 or higher) within one year Trenholm State expects that through the QEP, data collection will demonstrate a decrease in the number of students taking developmental mathematics, improve success rates for students enrolled in developmental mathematics and capstone mathematics courses, improve developmental mathematics competencies, and provide a positive experience for students in mathematics courses. To achieve the QEP goals, initiatives within the QEP include developing a \u201Cmath boot camp\u201D to provide math instruction and overview of math concepts before students take the math placement assessment with the goal of decreasing the number of students placing into developmental math courses; provide professional development for all faculty to ensure students are enrolled in appropriate developmental math courses and capstone math courses during the first or second semesters of enrollment; redesign the developmental mathematics curriculum and instructional delivery methodologies in accordance with the Emporium model which demonstrates success in mathematics courses; and use primarily full-time instructors to teach developmental math courses to enhance availability and student support.

Below are Trenholm State's outcomes, performance criteria, and most recent results. For comments or questions about this information, contact Dr. Mimi Johnson at mjohnson@trenholmstate.edu in the Office of Institutional Effectiveness. Student Achievement Data FAQ What is SACSCOC? The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges is the regional body for the accreditation of degree-granting higher education institutions in the Southern states. It serves as the common denominator of shared values and practices among the diverse institutions in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Latin America and other international sites approved by the Commission on Colleges that award associate, baccalaureate, master's, or doctoral degrees. For more information, see http:\/\/www.sacscoc.org\/ . What is SACSCOC accreditation? According to SACSCOC, Accreditation ensures constituents and the public of the quality and integrity of higher education institutions and programs, and to help those institutions and program improve. In order to award degrees\/certificates and to be eligible to receive student financial aid and participate in other federal programs, institutions in the U.S. must be accredited by one of six regional accrediting bodies that are recognized by the U. S. Department of Education. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) accredits institutions in the state of Alabama. This peer-review accreditation process involves a comprehensive self-study, off-site review, a 3-day on-site visit, and review by the SACSCOC Board of Trustees. Further, SACSCOC states, \"When accreditation is awarded to an institution of higher education by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), it means that the institution has (1) a mission appropriate to higher education, (2) resources, programs, and services sufficient to accomplish and sustain its mission, (3) clearly specified educational objectives that are consistent with its mission and appropriate to the degrees it offers, and that it is (4) successful in assessing its achievement of these objectives and demonstrating improvements. Accreditation by SACSCOC is a statement of the institution's continuing commitment to integrity and its capacity to provide effective programs and services based on agreed-upon accreditation standards.\" Why is it important to TSCC? Accreditation is important to TSCC because it is important to the success of our students. Without recognized regional accreditation, our students cannot earn valid degrees\/certificates. Additionally, SACSCOC contends that the purposes are to 1) improve quality throughout the institution, 2) assure the public that institutions meet established standards, and 3) enable institutions to provide financial aid. Accreditation demonstrates to our constituents that we operate with integrity in all matters and provide quality education to our students. What is the process for reaccreditation? After institutions receive initial accreditation through SACSCOC, they are reevaluated every ten years for reaffirmation of Accreditation.\" In this process, each institution addresses 2018 Principles of Accreditation covering topics such as integrity, governance and administration, finances, faculty, student services, educational programs, and policy compliance. Based on these principles, a self-study called the Compliance Certification Report is submitted for review. The report includes detailed narratives of our programs, services, and processes, as well as documentation and data to support our claims. An off-site team of peer higher education professionals reviews that report and provides feedback. Then, the institution responds to that feedback and prepares for an on-site review. A separate team of peer reviewers visits the campus to make their final assessment. The last step in the process is the review by the SACSCOC Board of Trustees. How long does it take and why? TSCC submitted its Compliance Certification Report in March 2018. Our on-site reaffirmation review will be on October 9-11, 2018. Then, the Board of Trustees for SACSCOC will make decisions regarding our reaffirmation in December 2018. What's the benefit to TSCC when we complete reaccreditation? Accreditation is all about continuous improvement of the university and its processes in order to support students in achieving academic excellence. Through the process of accreditation, we have the chance to evaluate our programs and services. If we are successful in improving our processes and procedures, then students will benefit. In addition, TSCC will continue to have degree-granting authority and access to federal programs including student aid. What is a QEP? The Quality Enhancement Plan is an integral part of the accreditation process, emphasizing SACSCOC's and the institution's commitment to continuous improvement. The QEP addresses a single, specific issue that can help strengthen and improve student learning. The QEP will be the major focus of the site visit in October. Trenholm State's QEP is Raising the Bar for Math Success. It is a five-year effort that focuses on enhancing student success in developmental math.
