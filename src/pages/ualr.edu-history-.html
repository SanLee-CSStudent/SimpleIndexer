We offer a Bachelor of Arts in History, a Bachelor of Arts in History\/Secondary Education, a Masters Degree in Public History, and a Minor in Geography. Our History of Civilization courses are an important element of the UA Little Rock Core required of almost all students, helping them to improve their knowledge of the past and their skills at analytical thinking, coherent argument, and clarity of expression. Upper-level courses on topics ranging from the Alexander the Great to Arkansas History serve our History majors, but are also popular with students in all disciplines. The major in History\/Secondary Education leads to a B.A. and a license to teach Social Studies, grades 7-12, in Arkansas. It is an important focus of our efforts, and its students account for about a half of all history majors. We are proud of the fact that all the graduates have found jobs in teaching, museum education, or have gone on to graduate school. Our Public History program trains graduate students to work in museums, archives, historical preservation programs, and a variety of other public and private organizations. Its students have an excellent record of finding jobs at these institutions, including the Clinton Library located in Little Rock. See what\u2019s new in the Department of History here.
