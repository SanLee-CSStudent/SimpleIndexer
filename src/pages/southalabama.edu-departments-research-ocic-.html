Byrd Many people have asked about donations and a scholarship fund has been set up for Dr. Byrd that will be matched by the Mitchell-Moulton Fund. Donations may be made at: https:\/\/giving.southalabama.edu\/byrd or designated in the South Fund portal at: https:\/\/southalabama.edu\/2022employeecampaign Interim Processes for the Office of Commercialization and Technology Transfer Dear Colleagues: Recently, I shared with campus the sad news of the passing of Dr. Andy Byrd, Director of the Office of Commercialization and Industry Collaboration (OCIC). In early January, Mr. Reggie Taylor retired and during the Pandemic the two other individuals in OCIC left the University, so I apologize that the Office has not been staffed. I want to thank all of the inventors and administrators who have helped us through the last three weeks in identifying actions that needed attention. Until the OCIC is again staffed with full-time professionals, we have set up interim processes outlined below: 1. Reggie Taylor will return to OCIC on March 21st for 15 hours per week (reggietaylor@southalabama.edu). He will be in the OCIC office from 8:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m., Monday through Friday. Reggie will handle: a. Material Transfer Agreements (MTA). They should be submitted through the techtransfer@southalabama.edu email. b. Reporting intellectual property activity into iEdison, as needed. c. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA\/CDA). Submit, as possible, through the techtransfer@southalabama.edu email. d. Track Invention Disclosures through the Invention Portal (https:\/\/www.southalabama.edu\/departments\/research\/ocic). 2. For all patenting, including provisional patents, copyright, trademark and licensing activities please contact me (lchronister@southalabama.edu) and Michael Chambers (michaelchambers@southalabama.edu) and one of us will follow up with you within 2 business days. We have contracted with Attorney Hunter Adams, at ADAMS IP, here in Mobile to assist with patenting and licensing activities. Mr. Adams will work in conjunction with the OCIC portfolio of IP attorneys to ensure that University\/ faculty intellectual property is fully protected and, when appropriate, licensed for use (https:\/\/www.adamsiplaw.com). Hunter will work directly with me and Dr. Michael Chambers, so it is important to contact me or Michael prior to conversation with Mr. Adams. Thank you for your patience over the next few months. We are committed to ensuring that you will be supported in all of your technology transfer needs. Please do not hesitate to contact us with questions, assistance or concerns. Lynne Chronister Vice President for Research and Economic Development University of South Alabama The OCIC is responsible for managing the intellectual property assets of the University of South Alabama, while also serving as the point of contact for industry collaboration partners. We orchestrate the cooperation between university, industry and government stakeholders to develop faculty inventions into products on the market. Although patentable inventions constitute the majority of OCIC\u2019s licensing activities, we also handle copyright, Tangible Research Property, Material Transfer Agreements, and Confidential Disclosure Agreements. Submit Invention Disclosure Disclosing your invention is just the beginning of the path to commercialization. Material Transfer Agreement Request transfer of research materials between organizations.
