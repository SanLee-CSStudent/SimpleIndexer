The Williamson Prize is awarded annually to a Lyon faculty member whose accomplishments as a teacher and a scholar, personal character and service to church and community make him or her deserving of such an honor. Nominations are solicited from faculty and students, and a Williamson Prize Selection Committee recommends a recipient to the Board of Trustees for its approval at its spring meeting. Wijetunge will receive the Williamson Silver Cup and a personal stipend of $2,500. He will also have the honor of giving the Williamson Prize lecture next spring. Some of Wijetunge\u2019s colleagues describe him as \u201Ca perfect model of a teacher-scholar,\u201D \u201Ca model citizen who embodies Lyon\u2019s commitment to impacting lives,\u201D and \u201Can exemplary educator and mentor.\u201D \u201CI am humbly happy to be recognized as the recipient of the Williamson Prize Award in the 150th year of Lyon College, which is very special,\u201D said Wijetunge. He continued, \u201CIt is a great feeling to join a distinguished group of faculty at Lyon, especially because your own colleagues evaluated and recognized your accomplishments.\u201D Wijetunge earned his B.S. in Finance, Business and Computational Mathematics Special Degree, from the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka: and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Central Michigan University. Over the last nine years, Wijetunge has served on numerous committees, both standing and ad hoc, including the Assessment Committee and the Athletic Committee, and Faculty Athletic Representative, to name a few. Wijetunge inspires his students to be independent problem solvers and develop confidence in mathematics. He is often praised for his positive demeanor, impactful teachings, and his patience, which allows students to conduct their studies in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Wijetunge also has strong ties to the community, both in the surrounding Batesville area and as far away as the Tennessee Buddhist Vihara over 120 miles away in Memphis, Tennessee, that Wijetunge and his wife, Dr. Irosha Nawarathne, frequent. Wijetunge has on several occasions, according to colleagues and students alike, invited members of the Lyon and Batesville community to accompany them to the temple, highlighting the inclusivity and generosity that they possess. \u201CI would like to thank all my colleagues and students for nominating me this year,\u201D said Wijetunge. \u201CThank you Lyon College and the Williamson family for your continuous support.\u201D faculty Williamson Prize commencement ?
