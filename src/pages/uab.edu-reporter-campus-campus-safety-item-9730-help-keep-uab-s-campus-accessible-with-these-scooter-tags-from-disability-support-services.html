But parking them improperly can prevent Blazers from accessing sidewalks, ramps, accessible doorways and more, according to Disability Support Services. To educate riders on parking procedures and discourage parking in inappropriate locations, DSS is providing informal violation tags that employees and students can place on improperly parked micromobility vehicles. No fines or penalties are associated with the tags, which are designed for instructive purposes only. \u201CIt\u2019s important to remember that everyone on our campus deserves the right to move about safely and without barriers,\u201D said Allison Solomon, DSS director. \u201CWe hope that, by mobilizing the Blazer community in an effort to prevent riders\u2019 parking their scooters or bikes in the wrong places, we can work together to make sure all feel welcome.\u201D DSS is coordinating distribution of tags to all building administrators to be used in their areas on campus. DSS also will distribute tags to interested Blazers upon request; employees and students also can request stickers for distribution by emailing dss@uab.edu. Ensuring UAB operates at its most accessible is in alignment with UAB\u2019s shared values of diversity and inclusiveness, respect, integrity and accountability, says Chief Facilities Officer Greg Parsons. DSS is coordinating distribution of scooter violation tags to all building administrators; employees and students also can request stickers from DSS at dss@uab.edu. \u201CPrioritizing our commitment to a safe and accessible campus is an example of our priority of diversity and inclusion \u2014 we must act out of respect for our fellow Blazers,\u201D Parsons said. \u201CWe do this by showing integrity through parking these vehicles properly, even when no one else is around. We must hold ourselves accountable.\u201D A friendly reminder from a tag could be just the ticket to help someone think about how their parking choice may affect others, says Jamie Grimes, academic adviser for the Department of Chemistry. It takes only a few seconds to move a micromobility vehicle out of the way, he continues, but it could make a big difference. \u201CScooters blocking pathways are unnecessary challenges that simply don\u2019t need to happen,\u201D Grimes said. \u201CWhere we park, even \u2018just for a minute,\u2019 and even where we stand while waiting for a classroom to be available are things we can be mindful about with very little effort or inconvenience to make things easier for others.\u201D Kristina Boyle, administration and operations manager in the Collat School of Business dean\u2019s office, says she personally has seen several instances of improperly parked scooters at the business school \u2014 they often must be moved from doorways, where they block card-reader access for wheelchair users. She has also seen them block sidewalks or curb ramps, which would also impact Blazers who use manual or electric mobility assistance chairs. In addition to utilizing the tags from DSS, Blazers can report improperly parked micromobility vehicles to UAB Transportation and the City of Birmingham using the Micromobility Reporting Tool form. The form also can be used to report scooterists and cyclists exhibiting risky riding behaviors. \u201CAcross campus, I\u2019ve noticed that scooters are left on sidewalks, ramps near curbs or on walkways approaching buildings \u2014 one example is on the University Boulevard side of Campbell Hall. Along with a lot of bicycles, scooters are left sitting on the only ramp to the doors. A student on crutches was having trouble navigating the maze \u2014 a wheelchair user would have been really challenged.\u201D Micromobility devices are a great asset to an urban campus such as UAB, says Brian Atkinson, UAB transportation demand manager, but it is important to continue to think of others while utilizing them. \u201COn such a large campus, it\u2019s wonderful to have multiple ways of navigating to work and class,\u201D he said. \u201CRentable scooters and bikes fill a niche gap for students in a hurry or not interested in a long walk. However, parking them in the proper places is a must to make sure all Blazers can get around without any issues.\u201D In addition to utilizing the tags from DSS, Blazers can report improperly parked micromobility vehicles to UAB Transportation and the City of Birmingham using the Micromobility Reporting Tool form. The form also can be used to report scooterists and cyclists exhibiting risky riding behaviors.
