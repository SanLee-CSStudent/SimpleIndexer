Students are guaranteed the transfer of applicable credits and the equitable treatment in the application of credits for admissions and degree requirements. Course transferability is not guaranteed for courses identified in ACTS as having \u201CNo Comparable Course.\u201D Additionally, courses in which a student has earned a \u201CD\u201D frequently do not transfer, and institutional policies may vary. ACTS may be accessed on the Internet here: ADHE website. In the Undergraduate Bulletin, beginning with the 2013\u20132014 issue, ACTS index numbers are included in relevant course lists and in the check sheet for the lower-division UCA Core. Course list links: UBulletin 2021\u20132022 UBulletin 2020\u20132021 UBulletin 2019\u20132020 UBulletin 2018\u20132019 UBulletin 2017\u20132018 UBulletin 2016\u20132017 UBulletin 2015\u20132016 UBulletin 2014\u20132015 UBulletin 2013\u20132014 UCA Core link: UBulletin LD UCA Core Check Sheet Additionally, the following table lists UCA courses and their ACTS counterparts. A course number and\/or name in red indicates local changes not yet reflected in the ACTS database. Notes Effective in the fall term 2018, BIOL 2406 and 2407, Structure and Function of the Human Body I and II, became BIOL 3406 and 3407. These courses are no longer ACTS aligned courses. Beginning with the fall 2018 term, therefore, students transferring courses aligned with ACTS BIOL2404 and BIOL2414 to UCA will receive credit for UCA\u2019s BIOL 1410 and BIOL 2410. * From the ACTS description of Human Anatomy and Physiology I and II: For transferability, Human Anatomy and Physiology I and II or equivalent must be taken at the same institution. ** Accounting and business courses are usually not considered general education core courses statewide. If in doubt, consult your academic advisor.
