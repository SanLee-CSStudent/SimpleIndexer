Rolling admission means that completed applications are reviewed on an ongoing basis, not after a set deadline. Rolling admission means that applications are accepted until the class reaches capacity. A rolling admission policy encourages early submission of applications. This means there is no specific deadline to apply for admission, but it is to your advantage to plan ahead and apply early. Slots are filled on a first-come, first-served basis (as long as each applicant meets the school's requirements) until the class is full. Due to the nature of rolling admission, capacity can be difficult to predict. It is usually mid-to-late Spring. Whenever full subscription of programs occurs, notice will be posted. Admission offers are issued for a specific term and are valid only for the term specified.
