Research & Innovation ? Grantsmanship and Compliance Office of Grantsmanship and Compliance Welcome to the Office of Grantsmanship and Compliance Felecia Moss Grant, Associate Director Email: fmossgrant@tuskegee.edu The Office of Grantsmanship and Compliance (OGC) supports and enhances the research infrastructure within the Division of Research and Sponsored Programs, and ensures that the University adheres to compliance regulations of all federal agencies. The regulations stipulate that institutions receiving federal funds for research and other sponsored programs must have policies and procedures in place to ensure that federal, state and local requirements are met in the use of funds and conduct research. Federal funding could be lost or not granted when the applicant institution does not comply with the mandated requirements. The OGC coordinates the assurance process for faculty and staff through the Vice President for Research and Sponsored Programs. Compliance review is an essential function of the application process and is applicable to all projects involving human subjects, vertebrate animals, carcinogens, recombinant DNA, biological and chemical hazardous material and proprietary materials.
