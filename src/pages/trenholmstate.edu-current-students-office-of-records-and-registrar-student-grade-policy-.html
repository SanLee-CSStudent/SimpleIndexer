100 4 B Good 80 - 89 3 C Average 70 - 79 2 D Poor 60 - 69 1 F Failure Less than 60 0 I Incomplete Must be removed during the following term or the grade of F will be assigned 0 AU Audit Must be declared during registration. No grade is assigned. 0 W Withdrawal Credit hours will be averaged into the grade-point average 0 WF Withdrawal Failing Credit hours will be averaged into the grade-point average 0 Satisfactory grades are \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\". However, a grade of \"D\" is NOT considered a passing grade in a developmental course or in some programs of study. A student must earn a minimum final course average of 70, a grade of \"C\", to pass a developmental course. Some programs may have a more stringent grading system due to external agencies\/accreditation requirements. If a student withdraws from courses by the published withdrawal date identified in the College Calendar, a grade of \"W\" will be assigned. If a student never attended or the class is cancelled, the class will be deleted, and no grade will be assigned. Grade Point Average (GPA) To obtain a numerical measure of the quality of a student's work, quality points are assigned to grades as indicated below: A - 4 Quality Points 3 semester hours of \"A\" = 3 x 4 = 12 quality points B - 3 Quality Points 3 semester hours of \"B\" = 3 x 3 = 9 quality points C - 2 Quality Points 3 semester hours of \"C\" = 3 x 2 = 6 quality points D - 1 Quality Points 3 semester hours of \"D\" = 3 x 1 = 3 quality points F - 0 Quality Points 3 semester hours of \"F\" = 3 x 0 = 0 quality points The grade point average (GPA) of a student is determined by multiplying the number of quality points for each grade received by the number of credit hours for that course. The total number of quality points is divided by the total number of credit hours attempted, excluding courses with W, I, and AU designations. Example: 30 quality points divided by 12 semester hours attempted = 2.5 GPA. Incomplete (I) Grade With the permission of the instructor and appropriate dean, an \u201CI\u201D may be assigned when a student\u2019s work in a course is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student\u2019s control but is otherwise of passing quality. Unless the deficiency is made up within the following term, the \u201CI\u201D automatically becomes an \u201CF\u201D. In the event that circumstances prevent the deficiency from being made up within the following term, the College reserves the right to extend the make- up period for up to two semesters after the \u201CI\u201D is awarded. An \u201CIncomplete Grade Contract\u201D form must be signed by the student, instructor, program coordinator, and the appropriate dean. The instructor is responsible for securing all signatures required on this form before submitting it to the Office of Records along with the Class Attendance Roster. Students are not allowed to secure these signatures. An incomplete grade (\u201CI\u201D) does not count toward course work completed and is not counted as courses attempted; therefore, it does not negatively impact on the incremental measurement of progress. A GRADE OF \u201CI\u201D - INCOMPLETE - IS NOT COUNTED IN HOURS ATTEMPTED AND EARNED. However, the grade that replaces the \u201CI\u201D is counted in hours attempted and hours earned once it is removed. An \u201CI\u201D grade is intended to be only an interim course grade. Unless the deficiency is made up within the following term, the \u201CI\u201D automatically becomes an \u201CF.\u201D **Students who are receiving Financial aid or any financial assistance (Scholarships, WIOA, VA, etc.) should contact the Financial Aid Department to determine how receiving a Grade of \u201CI\u201D will impact your future eligibility. Grade Changes If a student has reason to believe that the letter grade earned in a course is wrong, the student must make an informal effort to correct the error with the instructor who issued the grade. If the informal efforts of the student and faculty member have not produced a satisfactory resolution, a formal appeal is in order. See the Formal Grade Appeal Process below. The grade change must be made within one semester after the grade was initially earned. Grade changes after one semester must be done through the Final Grade Appeal Process. The instructor is responsible for securing all signatures required on the Grade Change Request form before submitting the form to the Office of Records. Students are not allowed to secure these signatures. Grade Report Students may access their grade reports and view their academic status via \u201CMy Trenholm\u201D on the College website, www.trenholmstate.edu, at the end of each term. The grade report becomes a part of the student\u2019s official transcript. The grade report will be withheld if there is an outstanding financial obligation to the College. If any student suspects that a grade may have been recorded in error, the student should schedule a conference with the instructor of that course. This must be done by the last day of the next term. If an error has been made, it will be corrected and reflected on the student\u2019s transcript. If resolution is not attained, the student may appeal to the program coordinator. The program coordinator may resolve concerns or may convene an Ad Hoc Appeal Committee to review the concern. The Committee will decide and forward a recommendation to the Dean of Instruction. If a resolution is not obtained, the student may file a written appeal to the Dean of Instruction. Formal Grade Appeal Process If the informal efforts of the student and faculty member have not produced a satisfactory resolution, a formal appeal is in order. A written appeal should be initiated by the student prior to the last day of classes of the semester following the semester in which the grade was issued. After this deadline, the appeals will not be considered. The following procedures should be followed for formally appealing a grade: The student should first contact the instructor and request verification of the grade and how it was determined. If the student does not receive satisfaction from the instructor, the student may confer with the program coordinator and the faculty member in an attempt to reach closure. If the appeal is resolved at this point, a \u201Cmemorandum of record\u201D should be prepared by the program coordinator and be retained on file. If closure is not reached, the student may file a formal grade appeal to the Dean of Instruction. This must be done in writing and dated prior to the one semester time limit. The appeal must state the name of the course, the reasons for the request, the dates involved, and the name of the instructor who issued the grade, to include all previous attempts to resolve the situation. The Dean will assign an Ad Hoc Grade Appeals Committee for deliberation. The Department Chair or the Program Coordinator will Chair the Committee. The Committee shall consist of two full-time faculty members, one faculty member from the discipline and one faculty member from outside the Division and a Student Services designee. The Committee will review the student\u2019s appeal letter, transcript, instructor\u2019s roll book, tests, papers, reports, projects, and any other documentation. A vote will be taken by the committee to attempt resolution. If no resolution is achieved, a formal hearing will be scheduled where the student and faculty member will be requested to present their sides of the matter. After deliberating, the Committee will make a recommendation to the appropriate dean to either support the grade as awarded or to change the grade. The dean will notify the student of the decision and\/or action within 3-5 days following the hearing.
