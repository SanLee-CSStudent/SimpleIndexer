Title IX Title IX Compliance All Title IX reports are reviewed by Tuskegee University\u2019s Title IX Coordinator: Mia Maxwell, Esq. Title IX Coordinator Phone: 334-727-8794 Office Address: Kresge Center, Suite 326, 1200 W. Montgomery Road, Tuskegee AL 36088 E-mail: mmaxwell@tuskegee.edu Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX states: No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. Some key issue areas in which recipients have Title IX obligations are: recruitment; admissions; counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment, which encompasses sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; treatment of LGBTQI+ students; discipline; single-sex education; and employment. Also, no recipient or other person may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or its implementing regulations, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in a proceeding under Title IX. For a recipient to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. The Department\u2019s Title IX regulations (Volume 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 106) provide additional information about the forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX. NON-DISCRIMINATION STATEMENT Tuskegee University (TU) prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment and education programs and activities. This policy applies to all students and employees and to conduct occurring in locations, events, or circumstances over which TU exercises substantial control over both (1) the respondent, and (2) the context in which the conduct occurs, including on school grounds, any building owned or controlled by a student organization officially recognized by TU; and through technology resources provided by TU or impacting a student or employee at a location owned, leased or controlled by TU or a recognized student organization. TU will process all sex discrimination reports it receives, including reports of sexual harassment and sexual violence, to determine whether the conduct alleged in the report, if proved, would constitute sexual harassment as defined in applicable regulation.1 This includes complaints of sexual assault or harassment made by students and employees, and against students, employees. TU reserves the right to address potential disciplinary infractions that fall outside of the Title IX\u2019s scope under its student, employee and faculty codes of conduct. TU will take appropriate action should it receive a formal complaint, as defined in applicable regulation1, that any contractor, vendor, partner, or other affiliate has engaged in sex-based misconduct, up to and including termination of the business relationship. __ A.

Even if a complainant asks TU not to take any action, the University may be obligated to investigate the complaint; and Prohibitions against retaliation. Complaints by the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator is the only TU official authorized to initiate a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator may, under some circumstances, initiate a formal complaint whether or not the person alleged to be a victim wishes to participate. Such a conclusion can only be reached by the specially trained Title IX Coordinator, and only when specific circumstances justify that action. The Title IX Coordinator will only initiate a formal complaint against a person's wishes if doing so is not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The reasons for the decision must be documented. Temporary removal on an emergency basis. TU is authorized to remove a person from its education programs or activities on an emergency basis, with or without a pending grievance process. In this event, the person must be given post-removal notice and an opportunity to challenge the removal. Confidentiality. TU will make reasonable efforts to preserve the privacy of all involved parties and will only disclose information regarding reports or complaints under this policy on a need to know basis, primarily to persons who are responsible for investigation, evaluation and reporting requirements. TU cannot require the parties to maintain confidentiality. C. TRAINING Title IX training is available to all students and employess.(See training link below). Any individual serving as a Title IX Coordinator, investigator, or decision-maker, and persons designated by TU to facilitate the formal resolution process must not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and any person who facilitates a formal resolution process must receive training on the following: The definition of sexual harassment in ¡×106.30; The scope of the University's education programs and activities; How to conduct an investigation and grievance process, including hearings, appeals, and informal resolution processes; The presumption that the respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct; and How to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts at issue, conflicts of interest, and bias. Decision-makers must also receive training on: Any technology to be used at a live hearing; and issues of relevance of questions and evidence, including when questions and evidence about the complainant's sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant. All training provided by the Title IX Coordinator must be gender neutral and free of any sex bias or sex stereotyping. Any materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and any person who facilitates a formal resolution process must not rely on sex stereotypes and must promote impartial investigations and adjudications of formal complaints of sexual harassment.
