Meet Dave Riek Sometimes extracurricular involvement can be highly influential in helping us find our path in life, and that statement couldn\u2019t be any truer for Dave Riek, the general manager for the KAWC radio station. Mr. Riek initially had an interest in politics and law and he had the opportunity to exercise examining and discussing these subjects in his high school debate team, but it wasn\u2019t until he got into debate in college that his plans changed. \u201CI got my scholarship to NAU because I was involved with the debate team [at college] and at NAU, I continued to do that,\u201D said Mr. Riek, \u201C. . . A friend of mine said, \u2018Hey, you should check out this radio thing\u2019 and when I tried it, I was doing the exact same stuff but on a radio and it was a lot more fun. So I decided I wasn\u2019t going to become a lawyer, I was going to become a radio guy, and it\u2019s been a natural fit and I\u2019ve really enjoyed it ever since.\u201D For Mr. Riek, that discovery and involvement wouldn\u2019t have been possible without his degree, which he was able to finish thanks to his scholarship. Today, he remains thankful for the help he\u2019s received and pays it forward by having $10 from each of his paychecks sent to the AWC Foundation and assisting in the yearly \u201CRadio Active Variety Show\u201D fundraiser in addition to the La Cosecha scholarship that he and his wife, Dr. Ellen Riek, currently fund. \u201CThe main thing is that, especially as somebody who\u2019s been through college and knows how much it\u2019s affected your life and improved your life,\u201D he said, \u201Cto be able to pass that on to other people, I think that makes you feel good.\u201D Mr. Riek is the KAWC general manager and has a bachelor\u2019s of science degree from NAU. Austin Vaughan Memorial Scholarship Austin Fred Vaughan\u2026.there were so many qualities about this young man and the way he decided his future. Austin started in his junior year at Antelope Union High School researching careers and calling the schools he was interested in attending. When he narrowed down his choice, nothing held him back. Austin spoke to the instructor at Chandler-Gilbert Electrical Utility Technology (EUT) Program and was given the outline of what he needed to do to get a spot in the course. Austin did not waste time, he met with Josie Uriarte, Center Assistant of the Wellton Learning Center, and with her help he completed the requirements needed. Because of his determination, Austin landed a spot at the Chandler-Gilbert EUT Program for August of 2013. At the same time Austin was completing the courses for the EUT Program, he had become interested in the Volunteer Fire Department in Tacna, Arizona. There was an instant love and desire born in him to help his community, he took this very seriously and did not miss his meetings or training sessions. On the night of Austin\u2019s high school graduation in May of 2012, Joe Rivera, Chief of the Tacna Fire Department and Gary Shaw, Assistant Chief, presented him with his fireman badge. Austin was so proud and a part of him matured that night. He had worked hard and his reward now was taking care of his community and being able to stand with his \u201Cband of brothers\u201D. We miss him so much. Robert, Marjorie, Shepard, Prestin and Aja Vaughan Austin's family established this scholarship in honor of their son to help students are not Pell Eligible, have attended Yuma County Public Schools, and are pursuing a Fire Science or Electrical Technicial degree or certificate.
