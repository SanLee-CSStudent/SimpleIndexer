Today we realize that each thing we do can help or hurt our planet in many ways. We all need to take ownership of environmental protection. EPA has tools to help you learn and understand the issues and help you reduce your environmental footprint. We challenge you to do your part to conserve resources. Going Green? Being \"green\" isn't just about recycling and solar panels. There are many small things each of us can do that will make a huge impact on our environment. Recycle\/Reduce\/Reuse Try to Incorporate the 3 R's into your daily routine. Here are some tips to help you: REDUCE: If waste was not created, there would be no need to throw things away in a landfill. There is no waste in nature...it is only created by humans! The very first step in the cycle is to REDUCE the amount of waste you generate in the first place. Use reusables instead of disposables. Buy products with less packaging to be thrown out. Share things with friends and neighbors. Shop used! REUSE: Let's face it, we live in a disposable society. It doesn't have to be that way. Purchasing quality products that can be reused instead of one-use-throwaways keeps that much more product out of our landfills. Use refillable water bottles. Take your own reusable bags to the store. Repair what's broken. Give reusable gift bags instead of throwaway wrapping paper. Keep shipping boxes & supplies on hand for reuse. Shop at secondhand stores, and make sure to donate your unwanted items to them for others to reuse. Refurbish old furniture. Sometimes, reuse projects can be a good way to bond with family and friends, learn new things, and give you great memories! RECYCLE: As a last ditch effort, recycling eliminates the need to incinerate or bury trash, which sends toxins into our environment or could contaminate our groundwater (read: drinking water). Recycle everything you can, and make sure to buy recycled products to keep the cycle going. It's not one of the three R's, but another great way to reduce your waste is composting! Composting is the process for taking formerly living things (vegetable\/fruit\/food waste, lawn clippings, leaves, etc.) and turning it into compost (healthy dirt). You can even compost napkins and paper towels since they used to be living trees. According to the EPA, 36 million tons of food waste is generated each year! Just do an internet search for 'household composting' and you'll find lots of websites with information to get you started. If you like to garden, you should definitely incorporate composting into your routine to help cut costs and keep your plants healthy and strong.
