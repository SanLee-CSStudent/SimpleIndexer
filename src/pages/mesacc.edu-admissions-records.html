MCC is dedicated to providing as many services as possible during this time. FERPA requires MCC to verify a student's identity if we are required to access a student's account to provide information. We can then answer questions regarding admissions, registration, and financial aid upon identity verification. Live chats may be recorded and logged. The Office of Admissions opens the door to Mesa Community College. We do more than just process your student application for admission to MCC, we are here to assist you in registering for classes, paying tuition, and obtaining records. Almost all processes can be performed through your Student Center using my.maricopa.edu. Use your MEID and passwords to access online services, apply and register for classes every semester until graduation, search for classes, view grades, order official transcripts and make payments.
