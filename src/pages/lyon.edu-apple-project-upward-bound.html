The goal of this program, which is funded through the U.S. Department of Education, has been to increase the number of high school graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who enter college and persist to become college graduates. The APPLE (Accelerated Program of Personalized Learning and Enrichment) Project Upward Bound program works with eligible high school students who have the academic potential and the desire to succeed in postsecondary education. APPLE UB serves students from its target high schools in four counties: Batesville, Cedar Ridge, Midland, and Southside in Independence County; Newport and Tuckerman in Jackson County; Cave City in Sharp County; and Mountain View in Stone County. APPLE UB students make a long-term commitment (from their 9th grade year through their summer of graduation from high school) to weekly school-year attendance for tutoring, mentoring, and enrichment and to the six-week summer program of college-preparatory and college-credit classes. Through a 24-week Academic Session, a 6-week Residential Summer Session, and a Bridge Component for a select group of its most recent high school graduates, APPLE UB offers college-credit and college preparatory courses; academic tutoring; learning skills development; academic advising; personal mentoring; cultural, social, and recreational enrichment; and an academic climate aimed at strengthening the students' sense of well-being and security within a postsecondary environment. \u201CSince 1967, Lyon College has offered an Upward Bound program that serves high school students in north-central Arkansas, helping them to succeed academically in high school, enter college, and then become college graduates, \u201C said Lyon College President Dr. Joseph King. \u201CWe have just learned that Lyon\u2019s APPLE program has received funding for another five years, and we feel fortunate. We believe in this program and are proud of the work of Jeanette Youngblood, Project Director, and her staff.\u201D Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students Patrick Mulick said, \u201COur APPLE and UBMS programs are vital parts of our campus. They provide an abundance of resources to first generation, low-income high school students in our area. Additionally, they provide work and volunteer opportunities for many of our faculty, staff, and students. Lyon is fortunate to be able to serve our community through these programs.\u201D Lyon College Start Your Future Lyon is more than just a college. It's a community distinguished by its academic curriculum, unique honor and social systems, and award-winning professors.
