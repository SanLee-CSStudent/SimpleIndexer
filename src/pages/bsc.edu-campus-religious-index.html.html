As a United Methodist Affiliated College, Birmingham-Southern\u2019s Chaplain and Office of Religious Life exist to provide opportunities for community worship, study, pastoral care, and interfaith dialogue. In this place we can all share a voice and be invited to participate in service and conversations that bring us closer to each other and our own spirituality. All are welcome and we hope in some way, you\u2019ll join and grow with us. Check out the other pages here to find the people and places to help you connect, learn, and grow with BSC Religious Life.
