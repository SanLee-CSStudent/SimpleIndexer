We are happy to report that the College has received grant funds as a part of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund funded by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. TSCC CARES Act grant funds can be used to provide financial assistance to relieve you of the financial burden you may have faced transitioning from on-campus to online instruction due to COVID-19 and other expenses to allow you to focus on your education to meet your academic goals. Trenholm State has signed and returned the agreement form to the U. S. Department of Education. The college has sent 50 percent of the CARES Act funds directly to students in the form of Emergency Financial Aid Grants. The first step in determining if students may qualify for the CARES Act funding is the completion of the 2019-2020 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). We encourage ALL students to complete the FAFSA, even if you think you may not be Pell grant eligible as you may qualify for assistance under the TSCC CARES Act funding. If you were enrolled during the Spring semester and received Pell grant funds, a 2019-2020 FAFSA is already on file with the College. There are no additional requirements to be considered for TSCC CARES Act grant funds at this time. For more information, contact the Business Office at 334.420.4200 or TSCCCashier@trenholmstate.edu.
