The program grew out of the Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering, and the faculty have retained the approach of considering the whole system in the design process. UA Little Rock mechanical engineers complete a start-to-finish mechanical design in the senior capstone experience. Our students are ready to start their first engineering job upon graduation, and many of the students begin their industry experience during their studies through our internship program. The program is accredited by ABET from Oct 1, 2016 \u2013 Present. Program Educational Objectives Practice mechanical engineering on complex systems in a variety of industries Pursue graduate education and research in engineering and related fields Assume leadership roles throughout their professional careers Pursue Professional Engineering licensure Process The mechanical engineering program faculty developed these Objectives in conjunction with its Industry Advisory Council. The program faculty regularly engages stakeholders (faculty, students, alumni, administration, and local industry) in adapting the PEOs to be consistent with their needs and aspirations. Student Learning Outcomes an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
