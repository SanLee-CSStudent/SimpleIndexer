Domain for NPC: npc.edu Northland Pioneer College embraces both the letter and the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act, its amendments and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

This image is of a student who is blind, and with the help of his sight guide, hiked to Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon in October 2010. The hiker had to trust that his sight guide would keep him on the trail. The accomplishment was all his, but the trust in his sight guide was as essential as sturdy hiking boots. NPC's service guidelines are our way of providing accurate information so that you can trust that the services provided by NPC embrace both the spirit and the letter of disability law in higher education. Each link provides information and guidelines regarding OAI services. Closure & Follow-up Documentation Guidelines Eligibility Interpreting Services Notetaking Services Service Animals Overview FAQ about Service Animals and the ADA Service Providers Guidelines Accommodation Appeals Services Not Provided by the OAI Office How often should a student meet with the OAI Office? Typically, a student should meet with the OAI Office each semester or whenever a change is made to their classes in which they are receiving academic accommodations. What documentation is considered disability documentation? Disability documentation is any document that includes your diagnosis and current limitations. If your disability, such as a learning disability, changes over time, then you will need to have documentation that is less than three years old. What if an instructor believes that one of their students has a disability? Instructors can inform students about the Office of Accessibility and Inclusion. It is up to the student to decide if they want to utilize any academic accommodations. An instructor cannot provide any accommodations until receiving an accommodation contract from the OAI Office. Is it okay for a student with a disability to not utilize OAI Services? Yes. The student has the right to choose whether or not to use academic accommodations, but must meet the same expectations as any other student. Do OAI Accommodation Contracts cover every class for the length of the time the student attends NPC? No. The accommodation contracts are only valid from the date they are written to the end of the semester for that one class. Students need to meet with the OAI Coordinator each time their classes or their accommodation needs change. 2020 Week 1 \u2013 Angela Madsen (PDF) Week 2 \u2013 Adam Farris (PDF) Week 3 \u2013 Dick & Rick Hoyt (PDF) Week 4 \u2013 Connor Doran (PDF) Week 5 \u2013 Andrea Dalzell (PDF) 2019 Week 1 \u2013 Kristi Rugg (PDF) Week 2 \u2013 Anthony Cornell (PDF) Week 3 \u2013 Lauren Oplinger (PDF) Week 4 \u2013 Jenny Duttle (PDF) Week 5 \u2013 Rhonda Bingel (PDF) 2018 Week 1 \u2013 Haben Girma (PDF) Week 2 \u2013 Johanna Lucht (PDF) Week 3 \u2013 Morris Frank and Buddy & Dorothy Eustis (PDF) Week 4 \u2013 The 70,273 Project (PDF) Week 5 \u2013 Jimmy Hatch Spikes K9 Fund (PDF) For NPC Faculty: Access Accommodation Letters Northland Pioneer College does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, veteran status, religion, marital status, gender, age or disability in admission or access to, or treatment or employment in its educational programs or activities.
