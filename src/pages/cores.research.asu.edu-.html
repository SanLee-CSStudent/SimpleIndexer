Our highly parallel computational capacity provides researchers with the ability to perform trillions of calculations per second - enough to simulate operations at a yet-to-be-built nuclear power plant, model NASA missions or test nuclear weapons without detonating them. Previous Next ASU Core Research Facilities Strategize. Access. Create. ASU Core Research Facilities help researchers achieve their goals via access to high-level equipment and PhD-level scientific subject matter experts. Cores is also the go-to institution for businesses and industry leaders looking to conduct research. With access to the latest equipment and expert assistance, all clients can utilize the high-level services they need to achieve their objectives. Core Research Facilities provide: One-stop access Project development. Training. Workforce development. Grant writing (co-PIs) and collaboration, budget proposals. Processing drop-off samples. Ad-hoc work. This cost-effective approach to research provides businesses with the benefits of collaborating with a top research university at a fraction of the cost of owning and maintaining their own equipment and facilities. Other benefits: Project development: Industry experts provide guidance in achieving goals (grant writing, process flows, budgets). Ability to scale: Aid in taking idea from concept through completion, regardless of size or scope. Consultation: Helping researchers identify needs and develop custom scopes of work.
