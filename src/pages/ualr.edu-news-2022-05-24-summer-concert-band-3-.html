The Summer Concert Band, which performed 2017 to 2019 under the direction of Dr. Kenneth Goff, director of bands and professor of music education at UA Little Rock, has been absent in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. Goff is planning to return with a bigger and better concert than ever before. In addition to the Summer Concert Band, UA Little Rock is adding a Jazz Band, which will be led by Dr. Michael Underwood, this summer due to popular demand. The Summer Concert Band and Summer Jazz Band are open to all high school students and community members who play an instrument. No prior registration is required. Anyone who wants to join the bands should simply show up for the first rehearsal. The Summer Concert Band will rehearse from 6-8 p.m. May 31, June 2, June 7, and June 9. Meanwhile, the Jazz Band will rehearse from 6-8 p.m. June 1, 3, 6, and 8. All rehearsals will take place in the Stella Boyle Smith Concert Hall in UA Little Rock\u2019s Fine Arts Building. Both summer bands will show off their skills during a free concert at 7:30 p.m. June 10 in the Stella Boyle Smith Concert Hall. According to Goff, the summer band is a fun-filled experience filled with high school band members, community members, music faculty and students, and alumni. \u201CI jokingly call it the danger band,\u201D Goff said. \u201CWe have four rehearsals and a performance, and you never know what you are going to get. It\u2019s exciting, but it\u2019s very much a fly by the seat of your pants type idea.\u201D The bands\u2019 performance will include \u201CChorale and Alleluia,\u201D \u201CAll the Pretty Little Horses,\u201D \u201CVariations on a Korean Folksong,\u201D \u201CCajun Folk Songs,\u201D \u201CThe Typewriter,\u201D \u201COld Irish Tune,\u201D selections from the movie \u201CMoana,\u201D Studio Ghibli\u2019s \u201CAnime March Medley,\u201D \u201CSoftly Speaks the Night,\u201D \u201CAncient Flowers,\u201D \u201CSo What\u201D by Miles Davis, and \u201CMoten Swing\u201D by Benny Moten. UA Little Rock students Carmen Ramirez, Elijah Jennings, and Alex Hughes as well as Andrea Lambert, a recent UA Little Rock graduate who previously did not have the opportunity to conduct the Summer Concert Band due to Covid, will serve as conductors for the performance. \u201COur community is so diverse,\u201D Goff said. \u201CI\u2019m a first-generation college student. When I was a kid, I wanted to go to band camp, but my family couldn\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s one of the reasons I enjoy leading this free summer concert band. This is a good opportunity for students and community members to get quality instruction and experience without having to take off a week of work, travel, or pay a lot of money. It\u2019s great community outreach, and it gives our students the opportunity to conduct. I think it encompasses everything we try to do as a university.\u201D For more information on the summer bands, contact Goff at kggoff@ualr.edu. community BandDepartment of MusicKen GoffMichael UnderwoodSummer Concert BandSummer Jazz BandUA Little Rock Share this Post: ?
