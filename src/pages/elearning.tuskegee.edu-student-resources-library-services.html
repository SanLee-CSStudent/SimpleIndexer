Individual member libraries in your community and elsewhere provide the actual services, such as loaning you a book or providing access to online articles. WorldCat lets you search the collections of libraries in your community and thousands of other libraries around the world.

Copyright Restriction Information NOTICE: WARNING CONCERNING COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, U.S. Code) governs the making of photocopies and other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be \"used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research.\" If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of \"fair use,\" that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law. By submitting an ILL request the user agrees to abide by these copyright restrictions. Copyright guidelines limit the number of articles a library can request during a calendar year from any given periodical title published within the past five years. This applies to all patron requests combined (not just a single individual); therefore, requests are sometimes rejected based on copyright restrictions.
