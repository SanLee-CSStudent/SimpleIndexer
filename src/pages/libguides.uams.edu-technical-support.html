All computers have Windows 7 with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for Office 2010. The machines are regularly updated for all three web browsers, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome including updates for major plugins like Adobe Acrobat Reader, Flash, and Java. Our goal is to keep these workstations operational and virus free at all times. To accomplish this we install a security software called Deep Freeze that keeps the computers from accepting permanent changes or files once the machine is rebooted. To provide a safe place to save files that can be accessed even after the computer is logged off or restarted, a folder on the desk top has been created. Printers and Photocopiers The Library has 2 printer\/copiers for public use. The color printer is on 1st floor and black and white printer is in the Silent Room (1\/114) also on 1st floor. Costs for prints is $0.10 for black and white and $0.20 for color. See the Circulation Desk staff for assistance with paying for prints. Smart Boards and Monitors The Library has equipped two conference rooms on second floor with Smart Board technology. There are workstations connected to each that can be used for displaying documents or browsing websites. Instructions for using the Smart Kap IQ application from your smartphone are in each room along with a manual that explains in detail how each component of the Smart Board connects. The Group Rooms located on the west side of second and third floors have forty inch televisions with an HDMI cable to connect a laptop. There are adapters for Apple devices that can be checked out at the Circulation desk as well as HDMI cables that can connect a laptop to the large screens in the Active Learning Center. Scanning documents: The printer\/copier units function as scanners and will convert documents into PDF format and email the document to the user's registered UAMS email account. There is no charge for this service. How to ask for assistance: Please see the Circulation Desk staff for assistance. If any of the equipment is not functional or is having issues, please contact the Technical Support team or complete the Technical Issue Reporting form. Software Productivity & Web Based Applications Enterprise licensing of Microsoft and other products makes these applications available for Library workstations. By default, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are installed on each machine, but the Technical Support group can allow access to the other Office 2010 suite of applications upon request. Web based applications such as Blackboard, Webmail, and Lockdown Browser are also installed and supported. In the Quiet\/Study area on first floor east, there ten computers that also have two statistical applications licensed by the campus, SAS and SPSS. We strive to keep the software installed current and receive Campus IT critical updates. If you notice that a product installed is not current or functional, please contact our Technical Support team or fill out the Technical Issue Reporting form. Wireless Network Connecting to the Network UAMS has two connections to the wireless network that can be used while on campus and in the Library. If you are a guest on campus, please use the UAMS Guest network. Connection to this network will require authentication through the campus ARUBA network with a valid email address. If you are a faculty, staff, or student, you will want to use the UAMS wireless account. Authentication with your domain credentials is required and if you are using a personal device some wireless settings may have to adjusted. Our Technical Support Team has the knowledge to help if assistance is required. Need help?

Please contact the UAMS Zoom Support team with questions, zoomsupport@uams.edu. 1. Password protect your meetings The simplest way to prevent unwanted attendees and hijacking is to set a password for your meeting. Passwords can be set at the individual meeting, user, group, or account level for all sessions. In order to do so, first sign in with your Zoom account. If you want to set up a password at the individual meeting level, head straight over to the \"Settings\" tab and enable \"Require a password when scheduling new meetings\", which will ensure a password will be generated when a meeting is scheduled. All participants require the password to join the meeting. Subscription holders can also choose to go into \"Group Management\" to require that everyone follows the same password practices. 2. Authenticate users When creating a new event, you should choose to only allow signed-in users to participate. 3. Join before host Do not allow others to join a meeting before you, as the host, have arrived. You can enforce this setting for a group under \"Account Settings.\" or, when setting up a new meeting, check the box for Waiting Room so that only the host can admit attendees. 4. Lock down your meeting Once a session has begun, head over to the \"Manage Participants\" tab, click \"More,\" and choose to \"lock\" your meeting as soon as every expected participant has arrived. This will prevent others from joining even if meeting IDs or access details have been leaked. 5. Turn off participant screen sharing No-one wants to see pornographic material shared by a Zoom bomber, and so disabling the ability for meeting attendees to share their screens is worthwhile. This option can be accessed from the new \"Security\" tab in active sessions. 6. Use a randomly-generated ID Your Personal Meeting ID (PMI) is the default meeting that launches when you start an ad hoc meeting. Your PMI doesn\u2019t change unless you change it yourself, which makes it very useful if people need a way to reach you. But for public meetings, you should always schedule new meetings with randomly generated meeting IDs. That way, only invited attendees will know how to join your meeting. You can also turn off your PMI when starting an instant meeting in your profile settings. 7. Use waiting rooms The Waiting Room feature is a way to screen participants before they are allowed to enter a meeting. While legitimately useful for purposes including interviews or virtual office hours, this also gives hosts greater control over session security. 8. Avoid file sharing Be careful with the file-sharing feature of meetings, especially if users that you don't recognize are sending content across, as it may be malicious. Instead, share material using a trusted service such as Box. 9. Know how to Remove nuisance attendees If you find that someone is disrupting a meeting, you can kick them out under the \"Participants\" tab. Hover over the name, click \"More,\" and remove them. You can also make sure they cannot rejoin by disabling \"Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin\" under the \"Settings: Meetings - Basic\" tab. 10. Check for updates As security issues crop up and patches are deployed or functions are disabled, you should make sure you have the latest version. In order to check, open the desktop application, click on your profile in the top-right, and select \"Check for updates.\" Note that you must keep al of your devices up to date with the latest security patches in order to prevent exploits. 11. Recording sessions By default, only the meeting host can record the meeting, but it's easy to grant other participants the ability to do so. You will find the Recording options in Settings, where you can see different ways to modify how videos are recorded and most importantly, where they are saved. Never save confidential information to Zoom, always save meetings that are confidential locally. Preventing Zoombombing Please review any currently scheduled meetings and consider enabling the options below. These defaults can be changed during the creation of the meeting: Participants\u2019 microphones are muted when joining the meeting. Participants\u2019 video is off when joining the meeting. Only host can share screen. The host can assign a user as a co-host temporarily so they can share their screen if needed. Participants cannot join before host. Participants will be in a waiting area until admitted. Meeting ID set to Generate Automatically During a meeting, the host can immediately disable screen sharing and mute all participants by selecting the security button along the bottom zoom toolbar. Best practices to keep meetings secure include utilizing these settings and, when possible, only allow authenticated users. It is also recommended that an alternate host be named for meetings to provide a second person to be able to assist with security management. The UAMS Zoom Support team is available to assist with these and other Zoom questions you may have. For detailed instructions for implementing security, contact zoomsupport@uams.edu. NOTE: When using a personal Zoom account, you should also follow these best practices to prevent bad actors from scanning for open meetings. : May 18, 2022 1:36 PM URL: https:\/\/libguides.uams.edu\/technical-support Print Page Login to LibApps Tags: Library Technical Support, software support, support for computers, support for printing Page Title University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Connect with us: Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube LinkedIn Pinterest Disclaimer Jobs Copyright Statement Privacy Terms ? 2017 University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences | Little Rock, AR"}
