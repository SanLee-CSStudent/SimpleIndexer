Learn more in the next section, Changing Your Major or Campus. Changing Your Major or Campus Degree-seeking students should never need to reapply for admission to the university in order to change their major or campus (Main Campus\/Online Campus). Non-degree seeking students, on the other hand, must reapply as degree-seeking to change to the Online Campus or declare a major. Changing Your Major: Your request to change your major will depend on your application status. Applicants without an admission decision (not admitted or denied) need to email a written request to the Office of Admissions at admissions@ualr.edu. Admitted students will need to contact their new academic department or advisor, who will update your major in BOSS. The advisor can complete this Admissions form if they are unable to complete the request in BOSS. Changing Your Campus: Your request to change from one campus to another (Main Campus or Online Campus). Here are a few items to consider before making your request: Your major must be offered on the new campus. Many majors are only available on the Main Campus, so check the available online programs before requesting to move to the Online Campus. Students who need to complete developmental work based on their placement test scores need to pass these courses before requesting a campus change. Each course is only available on one campus. So, the Main Campus may offer online or hybrid courses that are not available to students in the Online Campus, and Online Campus students are limited to online courses designated for their campus. If you are already enrolled in a term and want to switch your campus for the same term, you will need to drop your courses before the change can be processed. You are only able to change your campus once per academic year. If all these items work for you, reach out to your academic department or advisor to request your campus change. They will complete the request through the Office of Records and Registration.
