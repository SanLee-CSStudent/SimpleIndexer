Chancellor Margaret Ellibee, Ph.D., announced earlier this year she will be retiring June 30. Ellibee has led the college since becoming president of then-Pulaski Technical College on Aug. 1, 2012. Her title changed to chancellor with the college\u2019s merger with the University of Arkansas System Feb. 1, 2017. An advisory search committee was announced in April to help guide the search process. Chaired by Dr. Richard Moss, Dean of Fine Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences at UA-PTC, the search committee members also include representatives from key local and state constituencies, campus faculty, staff, alumni, and a member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas, among others. The committee met for the first time in May to work alongside UA System President Dr. Donald R. Bobbitt and UA System Vice President of Development and Planning Chris Thomason to finalize the \u201Cposition profile\u201D to be used as the chancellor position\u2019s official job description. The position profile for the chancellor can be found on UA-PTC\u2019s chancellor search webpage. The position will be advertised nationally to draw a diverse group of qualified applicants. Moss, the search committee chair, said expectations are set to cast a wide net to capture a talented, diverse and highly qualified pool of candidates. \u201CThe Chancellor Search Committee is a dedicated group that is looking forward to a robust regional and national search to lead our unique, urban two-year college here in a largely populated and very diverse area in central Arkansas,\u201D Moss said. \u201CThe communities and constituents of central Arkansas are well represented by the search committee, and the committee members are extremely dedicated to filling the chancellor position at UA-PTC with the right person to carry out the mission of the college and serve the interests of the region and its workforce needs. I\u2019m confident that the search committee will fulfill its duty in reviewing candidates based upon merit and will find the individual who is an absolute fit for the institution and the population and workforce we serve.\u201D For more information about the UA-PTC chancellor search, please visit the search website.
