The Blue & You Foundation is a charitable foundation established and funded by Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield to promote better health in the Natural State. North Arkansas College (NAC) will use the $149,544 to purchase obstetric simulation equipment and provide cardiac monitor\/defibrillator training for EMTs and paramedics. \u201CIt\u2019s vitally important to train our first responders on the latest life-saving technologies,\u201D noted Dr. Rick Massengale, NAC president. \u201CThe Blue & You Foundation provided half of the funds to build our Simulation Center five years ago and their support has helped our students learn in a safe and controlled environment. We have several high-tech manikins including SimMom, SimBaby, SimMan 3G, and SimJunior that makes our Simulation Lab a cutting-edge learning facility for our students.\u201D \u201CThis critically needed technical equipment will enable Northark to offer hands-on obstetric delivery and cardiac care training for EMT and paramedic students,\u201D explained Dr. Josephine Kershaw, dean of health professions. \u201CWith limitations at clinical sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic, instructors have increased the use of simulations to provide clinical scenarios for students to experience many high-risk medical situations. The patient simulator equipment and mixed reality learning tools will also help to strengthen clinical partnerships on the local and regional level through joint obstetric and advanced life support training with community agencies. By providing high-fidelity manikins to enhance OB skills training, the Blue and You grant helps to address the gap in prenatal and pediatric healthcare in high-need shortage areas.\u201D \u201CEleven of our grants this year focus on education for medical professionals and eight grants address behavioral health issues that are extremely important to the health of all Arkansans,\u201D said Rebecca Pittillo, executive director of the Blue & You Foundation. \u201CTen of our grants will reach Arkansans statewide. And because we are very aware of the need for more health equity within our state, eight of our grants focus specifically on minority populations.\u201D The need for qualified healthcare workers and better access to behavioral health services continue to grow in Arkansas. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, one in five adults experience mental illness. And according to the latest state report on healthcare licensures in Arkansas, there were seven counties in the state that only had one primary care physician in 2019, and several had no dentists. \u201CThe Blue & You Foundation has been focused for the past two years on supporting urgent needs that arose due to the pandemic,\u201D said Pittillo. \u201CThe COVID-19 pandemic definitely elevated new health-related needs and emphasized existing needs in our state \u2013 social determinants that we hope these grants will positively impact.\u201D \u201CThe Blue & You Foundation has been focused for the past two years on supporting urgent needs that arose due to the pandemic,\u201D said Pittillo. \u201CThe COVID-19 pandemic definitely elevated new health-related needs and emphasized existing needs in our state \u2013 social determinants that we hope these grants will positively impact.\u201D Since 2001, the Blue & You Foundation has awarded more than $45 million to nonprofits and governmental agencies in all 75 counties.
