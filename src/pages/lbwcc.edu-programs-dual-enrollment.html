College courses count toward high school graduation credits, and the courses remain as a part of the student's regular transcript. When the student graduates from high school, college credits earned at LBWCC through this program are transferable to other public colleges and universities in Alabama through the State Transfer and Articulation Reporting System (STARS). Students planning to attend private or out-of-state colleges and universities should check with those admissions offices to determine their policies relative to dual enrollment and dual credit. Benefits of Dual Enrollment Cost Savings--Tuition and fees at LBWCC are significantly less than those at four-year colleges. Simultaneous Credit--Earn academic credit for both high school graduation and a college degree. Educational Edge--Get a jump start on your college career while easing the transition from high school to college. Eligibility Eligible students must meet the following criteria: Be a high school sophomore, junior, or senior. Have a minimum unweighted GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale. (Students in Automotive Mechanics, Building Construction, Cosmetology, Diesel Technology, and Welding must have a minimum unweighted GPA of 2.0 or higher.) Have written approval from their high school. Maintain a \"C\" or better in all attempted courses at LBWCC.
