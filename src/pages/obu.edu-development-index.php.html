Giving Opportunities Featured: Annie Abrams Living Legacy Award The Annie Abrams Living Legacy Award is a new scholarship to recognize black students involved in Ouachita\u2019s Multicultural Organization Reaching Equality (MORE) student organization who have demonstrated leadership, exemplified the university\u2019s mission and shown promise to positively influence the world. The award honors the living legacy of Arkadelphia native Annie Abrams \u2013 a civil activist, pursuer of social justice, educator, culture worker and museum curator. The scholarship took shape earlier this month following a $1,000 gift by former Ouachita student Stephanie Rodgers. Her gift came after June 4 during the memorial service for George Floyd, during which North Central University President Scott Hagan challenged universities nationwide to make additional investments in scholarships. A matching gift of $25,000 from an anonymous donor is in place to further grow and endow the scholarship, allowing it to be awarded annually for years to come. The matching gift doubles the impact of the first $25,000 given. Make your gift today at obu.edu\/give and list \u201CAnnie Abrams Living Legacy Award\u201D in the instructions line.

As we work to reach and influence every student, we can guide the course with which they serve our world and contribute to the enduring purposes of our faith. In keeping with our biblical principles, we looked to Ephesians 2:20 as it states \u201CJesus Christ is our chief cornerstone.\u201D Those who annually give to Ouachita create a living endowment that strengthens our university and enriches the lives of all Ouachita students. So many through these 130+ years have given so selflessly and lovingly. Without them, we would not be where we are today, nor would we be able to continue to imagine ways that we can better serve the highest of all purposes that Christian higher education represents. When you make a gift to the Ouachita Cornerstone Fund, you are giving to make a difference... ...in the lives of our students. The Cornerstone Fund supports student scholarships such as the Legacy Scholarship for children of former students and scholarship assistance for children of ministers and missionaries. ...in a commitment to our faculty. The Cornerstone Fund supports research projects and innovative learning experiences for all students that include travel and professional conferences. ...in the students' experience at a Christ-centered residential campus.

PLANNED GIVING Endowed Scholarships Endowed Scholarships Endowed scholarships provide financial aid that enables many students to choose Ouachita. These endowments are a living testimony of those who are committed to supporting students, Ouachita and Christian higher education. Individuals, families, churches, foundations or groups of donors with similar passions can create endowed scholarships to honor someone, such as a friend, family member, beloved pastor or treasured professor. The donor names and develops the criteria for award and records that information in the scholarship agreement. Awards are made based on the agreement and with the assistance of the University Scholarship Committee. Endowed scholarships create a permanent fund in which the principal remains invested and the earnings on the principal are distributed according to the Ouachita Baptist University Board of Trustees endowment policy. If you would like to know more about how to establish an endowed scholarship, please contact the Office of Development at (870) 245-5169 or development@obu.edu. Endowed Chairs Few gifts provide a more enduring and inspiring monument than the establishment of an endowed academic chair of instruction. The endowed chair may bear the name of the donor(s) or someone of the donor\u2019s choice. The position is distinguished by name in Ouachita publications, as well as being part of the title when referring to the distinguished professor who holds the chair at that particular time. Endowed chairs are awarded to professors who are prominent in their fields, outstanding teachers, and who have demonstrated exceptional ability in their selected discipline. The endowment is used to help meet the expenses of the professor\u2019s office, including salary and research costs. The endowed chair will be recognized by the memorial\/honoraria name in perpetuity. If you would like to know more about how to establish an endowed chair, please contact the Office of Development at (870) 245-5169 or development@obu.edu. FACULTY\/STAFF GIVING Faculty and staff come together each day to impact students and advance the mission of Ouachita. You are a part of every student\u2019s story, and you are the foundation for making the university and this community a Christ-honoring campus of academic excellence. Giving by our faculty and staff shows confidence in Ouachita and its mission. Your annual giving provides an opportunity to show the importance of philanthropy to our students, alumni and friends. In addition, private philanthropy is how we meet the needs of our students while showing programs and facilities while showing alumni, friends, corporations, foundations and others that you believe in and support the mission of Ouachita.

GIFTS OF APPRECIATED SECURITIES There are many ways to support Ouachita and the students we serve.
