There is also an adjacent 7,500 square foot reception area that sits in front of the arena. The reception area includes: Ticket booth Concession stand The office Meeting\/conference room Men\u2019s and women\u2019s restrooms A grilling porch About the Story Arena The construction of the rodeo arena was a part of the Blue and Gold Vision, the University\u2019s first capital campaign to raise more than $100 million. The arena itself was made possible by the generous $2 million gift from Magnolia residents Therral and Jan Story, the largest single-donor gift in SAU\u2019s long history. The arena is home to Southern Arkansas University\u2019s nationally competitive collegiate rode team, providing a place where members can practice rain or shine, as well as providing the opportunity for the SAU rodeo team to host annual rodeo events.
