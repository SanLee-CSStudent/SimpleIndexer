Due to our safety protocol this fall 2021 semester, we only offer the \u201Cwalk-in\/drop-in\u201D service virtually via Zoom. There are no \u201Cin-person\u201D walk-in\/drop-in availability. The virtual walk-in\/drop-in hours are Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. until 4 :00 p.m. on a first come, first serve basis. Click the yellow box below to access the walk-in\/drop-in service. Walk-In\/Drop-In Cancellation and No-Show Policy for Scheduled Appointments If you need to reschedule or cancel your appointment, please notify our office 24 hours in advance. This allows our staff to offer your appointment time to another student, who is in need of our services. Failure to cancel your appointment within 24 hours, more than once, will result in losing your appointment privileges for the semester; however, you may still utilize our drop-in services.
