GED¢ç is well accepted by the business and industrial community. The four GED¢ç subtests are designed for adults who have not finished high school, but who have gained knowledge and skills through life experiences, reading books and newspapers, and even listening to television and radio. The tests are designed to measure general knowledge and higher-order thinking skills. The following are areas of concentration: Reasoning Through Language Arts, Social Studies, Science, and Mathematical Reasoning. Official testing requires a valid Arkansas Driver\u2019s License or State issued photo ID. Each section of the test has a $4 fee (vouchers may be obtained if certain criteria is met.). The official testing site for the GED Exam is located on the main campus of Southeast Arkansas College.
