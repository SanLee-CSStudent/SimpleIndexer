Benjamin Larimer\u2019s project is focused on providing an extremely detailed look at the antibodies produced by people who have recovered from COVID-19. Could millions of viruses specializing in attacking bacteria offer new insights into SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the virus threatening humanity in the coronavirus pandemic? Benjamin Larimer, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Radiology and O\u2019Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at UAB, thinks so. Larimer is one of 14 recipients of pilot funding through the School of Medicine\u2019s Urgent COVID-19 Clinical Research and Laboratory Research Fund, which has raised more than $1.1 million in philanthropic support to fuel innovative research proposals. He is using that support to adapt his lab\u2019s work on a technique known as phage display \u2014 which he normally uses to look for new cancer treatments \u2014 in order to make an impact on COVID-19. Larimer\u2019s project is focused on providing an extremely detailed look at the antibodies produced by people who have recovered from COVID-19. Antibodies recognize antigens \u2014 in this case, SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 but they don\u2019t recognize the whole virus at once, Larimer explained. Instead, \u201Cthey recognize a small piece,\u201D he said. \u201CThe coronavirus is like a ball with a bunch of spikes all over it. The immune system generally recognizes things like that, so most antibody tests coming out now\u201D are designed to look for antibodies in a person\u2019s blood that bind to sections of that spike protein. \u201CThe problem is this is just one coronavirus; there are other types that have similar spikes \u2014 not extremely similar, but similar enough that you could potentially have antibodies against, say, a type of coronavirus that causes the common cold,\u201D Larimer said. \u201CAnd that would trigger a positive antibody test, even though you aren\u2019t actually immune to the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.\" (Story continues below box.) How it works 1. Copy: The first step in Larimer\u2019s project was to order a customized version of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. \u201CEach protein has a specific DNA sequence that encodes for it,\u201D Larimer said. \u201CWe took those sequences and left out all the parts that make the virus able to replicate, then gave them to a company that makes DNA all day, every day. They look at that sequence chemically and then build it, base by base. They do this 10 million times over, verify it\u2019s the correct sequence, and send it to us.\u201D 2. Cut: Next, \u201Cwe take the DNA and chop it up,\u201D Larimer said. 3. Paste: Meanwhile, the phage is waiting. \u201CPhage DNA is a circle,\u201D Larimer said. \u201CWe open it up, put a piece of SARS-CoV-2 DNA into it and close it up.\u201D 4. Infect: Phages specialize in doing to bacteria what SARS-CoV-2 does to humans: infecting a host cell and forcing it to make countless copies of the invader. \u201CWe put our phages into bacteria, which will make millions of copies,\u201D Larimer said. \u201CThat happens a million times over, and we end up with a billion individual pieces of protein attached to phage that cover the entire sequence of the virus many times over. What we end up with is a library of virus proteins.\u201D 5. Test: The last step is to add antibodies from a patient\u2019s blood sample to this protein library, then wash away all the phages that did not manage to bind an antibody. What\u2019s left are the pieces of SARS-CoV-2 protein recognized by that patient\u2019s immune system. \u201CThat\u2019s how we screen antibodies,\u201D Larimer said. Phages are viruses that attack bacteria. Larimer trained at the University of Missouri with George Smith, Ph.D., who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018 for his work in developing phage display as a way to evolve new proteins. \u201CPhages have this unique property where we can insert small pieces of DNA \u2014 for instance the DNA of coronavirus proteins, minus the proteins that allow them to be infective \u2014 and then read out which part of the protein is being displayed,\u201D Larimer said. \u201CMy lab will make a huge library that contains all the non-infective proteins of the coronavirus. Then we\u2019ll mix that library with a suspected antibody against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. We\u2019ll pull out the phage they are binding to; that phage contains the DNA sequence that tells us what exact piece of the coronavirus they are recognizing. It will allow us to more specifically define what you are immune to and overcome some of the limitations of current antibody tests.\u201D One real-world application, Larimer said, would be as a second-level test to verify results for those with positive readings on antibody blood tests. And if, as happened with coronavirus tests, PPE and ventilators, antibody tests become hard to source, \u201Cwe wanted to be able to give UAB something that would help in day-to-day operations,\u201D Larimer said. \u201CPhages can be grown to high numbers in simple conditions. We can scale these up pretty inexpensively here at UAB and make the tests.\u201D \u201CThe other interesting thing you could do with this is around vaccines,\u201D he added. \u201CThe vaccines are attempting to induce immunity without exposing people to the virus. They are engineered in a lot of different ways, but many are using the spike protein. And the question that will emerge is, does the vaccine induce the same immunity as if you had acquired that immunity naturally by having COVID-19? We\u2019ll be able to map, specifically, does this vaccine produce antibodies against the same pieces of the virus as we see in recovered patients, or against different pieces? If the first generation of vaccines is not as effective as we hope, we can say, \u2019Let\u2019s use these common pieces of protein that we keep seeing in people who are naturally immune.\u2019\u201D Phages also \u201Care extremely inexpensive to produce,\u201D Larimer said. \u201COne of the limitations of current antibody tests is that you\u2019re making a big spike protein, which takes protein-engineering expertise, materials, big reactors. Phages can be grown to high numbers in simple conditions. We can scale these up pretty inexpensively here at UAB and make the tests.\u201D That is not to say there is no challenge involved, Larimer added. \u201CProbably the first time we test this in antibodies from patients we\u2019ll have to tweak it,\u201D he said. \u201CIt will take a few weeks to play with conditions and maximize specificity. My goal is to put this together, validate it on known antibodies, then test on blood samples from a subset of patients we know are COVID-positive and then on blood from before COVID-19 existed, so we know those are negative. Right now, we\u2019re focused on is getting this ramped up and seeing how it looks.\u201D Update Read an update on this project as of spring 2021 from the School of Medicine.
