As the ceremony progresses, you will process across the stage when your school is called. Will there be a traditional handshake and photo? There will be no handshake with the president or dean, but graduates will still have their photo taken.

After exiting the stage, there will be another photo opportunity at a designated portrait backdrop. After the photo, graduates will return to their seats.
