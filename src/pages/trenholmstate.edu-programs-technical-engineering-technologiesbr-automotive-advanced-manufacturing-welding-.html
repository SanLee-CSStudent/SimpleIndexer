Apply Now! What is Welding? Welders, cutters, solderers, and brazers use hand-held or remotely controlled equipment to join or cut metal parts. They also fill holes, indentations, or seams in metal products. Welders, cutters, solderers, and brazers typically do the following: Study blueprints, sketches, or specifications Calculate the dimensions of parts to be welded Inspect structures or materials to be welded Ignite torches or start power supplies Monitor the welding process to avoid overheating Maintain equipment and machinery Welding is the most common way of permanently joining metal parts. In this process, heat is applied to metal pieces, melting and fusing them to form a permanent bond. Because of its strength, welding is used in shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing and repair, aerospace applications, and thousands of other manufacturing activities. Welding also is used to join steel beams in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other structures and to join pipes in pipelines, power plants, and refineries. Welders work in a wide variety of industries, from car racing to manufacturing. The work that welders do and the equipment they use vary with the industry. Arc welding, the most common type of welding today, uses electrical currents to create heat and bond metals together\u2014but there are more than 100 different processes that a welder can use. The type of weld is usually determined by the types of metals being joined and the conditions under which the welding is to take place. Our Mission The mission of the Welding program at Trenholm State Community College is to prepare individuals to enter and progress in a career as a welder in manufacturing, construction or maintenance. This program is based on curriculum approved by the Program Advisory Committee and meets national industry skills standards.
