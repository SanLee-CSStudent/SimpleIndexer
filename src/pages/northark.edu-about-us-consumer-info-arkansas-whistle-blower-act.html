A whistle-blower is a person who witnesses or has evidence of waste or a violation of law while employed by a public employer and who communicates in good faith about the waste or violation to a supervisor, an agent of the public employer, or an appropriate authority (e.g., Office of Attorney General, Office of Auditor of State, Arkansas Ethics Commission, Legislative Joint Auditing Committee, Arkansas Legislative Audit, Prosecuting Attorney, etc.). If a public employer takes adverse action against a public employee, that employee may bring civil suit against the public employer to recover actual damages and injunctive relief. There are time limitations and other requirements applicable to this right of action. A public employee reporting waste or violations may be eligible for a financial reward. To anonymously report suspicions of illegal activity by government officials, call the FBI hotline at 501-221-9100 (Press Option 8) or 501-221-8200, or call the Arkansas State Police at 800-553-3820.
