Here are some in-action, gowning and gloving.\u2060 This activity is just a one event in our \"Scrub Olympics.\" We spend the first semester learning the skills and stressing over getting the skills perfectly correct so once everyone has passed their skills demonstrations, we have a fun day of friendly competition to de-stress and let go practicing the skills that they learned in a fun environment without worrying about getting a grade for it. Instead, we cheer for our classmates and celebrate with candy and a relaxing afternoon.\u2060 #surgery 1 week ago View on Instagram | 3\/8 nwti_edu \u2022 Follow My Town Tuesday!
