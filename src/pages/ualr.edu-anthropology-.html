Anthropology courses count in TWO different core areas: Understanding Cultures (ANTH 2316)* fulfills Core requirements in the area of Social Science and Physical Anthropology (ANTH 1415) is a Core Science course. These two courses are a great place to start if you think that an Anthropology major might be for you, or if you are just curious about what it means to be human from a global, holistic perspective from our deepest roots to our present concerns. *\u201DUnderstanding Cultures\u201D is a new name for the course formerly called \u201CCultural Anthropology.\u201D Please note that it is still the same course number and if you have already taken Cultural Anthropology, taking Understanding Cultures would replace your grades and credits for the earlier class. What is Anthropology? Anthropology is the study of what it means to be human \u2013 past, present, and future \u2013 anywhere in the world. It is global and it is local. Anthropologists study everything about people, ranging from the study of culture and social relations to human biology and evolution. It includes languages music, art, and architecture, and even the past vestiges of ancient human lives. Anthropology tackles topics such as how human behavior changes over time, how people move about the world, why and how people from varied cultures are different and yet also fundamentally the same, how the human species has evolved over millions of years, and how individuals understand and operate successfully in diverse cultural settings. Anthropology includes four broad fields and at UALR we believe a well rounded Anthropology student should have a grounding in all four. They are: cultural anthropology linguistic anthropology physical (biological) anthropology archaeology Each of the four fields teaches distinctive skills, such as applying theories, employing research methodologies, formulating and testing hypotheses, and developing extensive sets of data.
