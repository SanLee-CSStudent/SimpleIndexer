In assessing and documenting equivalent learning and qualified faculty, Trenholm State uses recognized guides which aid in the evaluation for credit. Such guides include those published by the American Council on Education, The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, and the National Association of Foreign Student Affairs. The Director of Records\/College Registrar is charged with initial evaluation of transcripts for potential transfer of credit. The Director of Records\/College Registrar has the authority to approve transfer credit applicable to a student\u2019s degree plan when (a) the transferred course meets the General Principles for Transfer of Credit as previously outlined and (b) the course name, level, description, and learning outcomes substantially match that of the course for which credit is awarded in the student\u2019s degree plan. In addition, the Director of Records\/College Registrar may grant transfer credit for a specific course in a student\u2019s degree plan when the transferred course is of a higher level and has the specific course (or one with substantially similar learning outcomes) as a prerequisite. For example, the Director of Records\/College Registrar may grant credit for MTH 100 (Intermediate Algebra) if the student earned a grade of C or better in MTH 112 (College Algebra) for which MTH 100 is a prerequisite. Other potentially transferable courses are evaluated for credit toward the student\u2019s degree plan cooperatively by the Director of Records\/College Registrar and designated faculty member. For general education courses, the designated faculty member is the lead academic instructor credentialed in the discipline. For technical courses in the student\u2019s major, the designated faculty member is the corresponding Program Coordinator. In determining whether credit is awarded, the Director of Records\/College Registrar and designated faculty member consider evidence such as the course description, the credentials of the instructor who taught the course, and the curriculum and learning outcomes detailed in the course syllabus. Credit is awarded when the evidence affirms that the student has achieved the knowledge, skills, and experiences comparable to those attained by students who successfully complete the required course at Trenholm State. The College will accept courses completed at other duly accredited colleges for transfer credit only when the student earned a passing grade of \u201CC\u201D or higher in the course and the course is part of the student\u2019s degree plan at Trenholm. Higher grades may be required by the College for selected courses provided the higher grades are also required in courses for native students. Transfer credit accepted for course work completed at another institution will reflect the letter grade earned and is not included in Trenholm State\u2019s GPA calculation. Transfer credit(s) will be evaluated during the first term of enrollment, only if transferrable grades are \u201CC\u201D or better. College transcripts will only be evaluated when all transcripts are received. Awarding of transfer credit to fulfill graduation requirements will be based on the applicability of the credits to the requirements of the degree pursued. Credit may be extended based on a comprehensive evaluation of demonstrated and documented competencies and previous formal training. (See section on Alternative Sources of Credit). Courses completed at Trenholm State may transfer to other duly accredited colleges and to the technical divisions of community colleges. Credits may transfer to the academic divisions of community colleges or to four-year colleges\/universities. However, the decision on the acceptance of transfer credits always rests with the receiving college. All requests concerning transfer courses should be directed to the college\/university to which a student plans to transfer. Credit for Prior Learning It is the philosophy of Trenholm State Community College that a student should not be required to repeat a learning experience for knowledge or skills currently possessed by the applicant. Therefore, if prior learning can be appropriately documented, the applicant may be awarded credit or advanced placement. Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) is a means for a student to receive college level credit for learning that took place in a non-traditional learning environment, such as on-the-job training, military training, professional development seminars, volunteerism, and experience in-field. PLA relies heavily on aligning learning gained through experience with outcomes found in traditional courses of higher education. A maximum of 25% of non-traditional credit may be awarded and applied toward graduation. Non-traditional credit is not posted to the student\u2019s transcript until the student is enrolled. Non-traditional credit may not count toward the 25% of TSCC work needed to satisfy residency for graduation. Students may not earn credit, through non-traditional academic work, for any course in which a grade has previously been received. PLA applies only to non-academic transfer courses. Credit awarded through nontraditional means for academic transfer courses may be awarded by examination or nationally recognized guidelines (AP, CLEP, ACT\/PEP, DSST, Challenge Exams, ACE PONSI\/CREDIT, ACE\/MILITARY) or through other statewide programs identified by the Alabama Community College System office. Industry-Recognized Credentials Credit(s) may be awarded for prior learning that has been verified and assessed through an industry-recognized credentialing process. Individual departments may identify specific licensure and\/or certification that will be accepted for course credit. The departmental faculty and the appropriate Dean will establish specific course credits to be awarded for specific industry credentials. The department must verify the credentials of the applicant requesting credit and attach supporting documentation for review by the appropriate Deans. There is no fee for evaluation of industry-recognized credentials.

There is no fee for evaluation of industry-recognized credentials. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Trenholm State Community College accepts credits earned from the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) if there is a course equivalent in the student\u2019s degree plan. Credit for CLEP subject examinations is granted based on 50th percentile scores with courses awarded for credit listed in the college catalog. Trenholm State is not currently a testing center for CLEP examinations but will evaluate and accept credits for CLEP examinations for courses listed in the college catalog. Students will be responsible for scheduling and paying for CLEP examinations. For information on testing centers, examinations, fees and other details, please visit the College Board website https:\/\/clep.collegeboard.org\/about-clep. Credit will be indicated on the student\u2019s transcript as \u201CEC\u201D (Exemption\/CLEP). Military Credit Military credit may be granted for any military service school or for any United States Armed Forces Institute\/Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Services (USAFI\/DANTES). Subject tests that have been satisfactorily completed and are determined to have a course equivalent in the student\u2019s degree plan will be accepted. Credit will be indicated on the student\u2019s transcript as \u201CED\u201D (exemption\/DANTES). STARS Statewide Transfer & Articulation Reporting System STARS - A Transfer Guide for Students Transferring to Colleges\/Universities in Alabama STARS stands for Statewide Transfer\/Articulation Reporting System. STARS is a web-accessible database system which provides guidance for prospective transfer students in the State of Alabama. The STARS System allows public two-year students in Alabama to obtain a Transfer Guide\/Agreement for the major of their choice. This guide\/agreement can guide the student through their first two years of coursework and prevents loss of credit hours when transferring to their four-year university in Alabama.
