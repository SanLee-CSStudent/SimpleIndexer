According to Tad Montgomery, Calhoun machine tool technology instructor, the two-day integrated manufacturing competition tests the skill sets of students from across the country in welding, programming, and machining. \u201CThis is one of our most exciting competitions,\u201D says Montgomery. \u201CNot only are our manufacturing students able to showcase what they learn daily through our course curriculum, but they are also gaining real-world experience when they compete on such a level with other students,\u201D he adds. Each team is presented with a tight budget as well as a challenge to create a product that is to be built using the required specifications. Just as in today\u2019s manufacturing industry, they are charged hourly rates against their budgets. \u201CCompetitions such as these are what sets Calhoun\u2019s manufacturing training apart from other institutions,\u201D commented John Holley, Calhoun\u2019s dean of technologies. \u201CWe try our best to provide our students with as many real-world hands-on training opportunities as possible that place them in situations to think and solve problems strategically. When we hear from area industry leaders, they tell us those are the skills desired in conjunction with our manufacturing training,\u201D added Holley. Calhoun\u2019s team consisted of members who possessed skills in CNC 5-axis programming, welding, metrology, and CNC 5-axis machining. Those competencies were necessary as judges scored the projects based on programming and production time, tooling and material costs, as well as overall quality. All machining components were inspected for dimensional size and geometric tolerances. The welding portion of the competition consisted of aluminum and steel tanks that had to withstand pressure testing, as well as adhere to a weld procedure standard. Only four teams were chosen as national champions, and Calhoun was one, finishing in 2nd place, and also making it the team\u2019s second national championship win in this annual competition. The event was recorded and will be aired this fall as was the previous year\u2019s competition on \u201CClash of the Trades\u201D. \u201CCalhoun\u2019s performance in Project MFG exemplifies the quality of training the college provides students in advanced manufacturing,\u201D says Montgomery. \u201CThe Department of Defense is working diligently to highlight these types of programs as well as the critical shortage for such skilled manufacturing workers. Such individuals are desperately needed to drive our economy and produce the systems used to protect our nation,\u201D Montgomery added. Calhoun boasts close to 100% job placement for its manufacturing degree programs. To learn more about Calhoun\u2019s technology programs, visit www.calhoun.edu\/technologies.
