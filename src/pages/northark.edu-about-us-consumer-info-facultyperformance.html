In accordance with Arkansas Code 6\u201063\u2010104, North Arkansas College conducts a rigorous, consistently applied, annual review of faculty to include assessments by peers, students, and administrators and is used to ensure a consistently high level of performance and serve in conjunction with other appropriate evaluations and job tenure. The evaluation by students and administrative staff, is applied to all teaching faculty, full\u2010time, and part\u2010time. Faculty evaluations provide guidance and assistance to all faculty in their professional development and academic responsibilities in the areas of teaching and service to the college. The annual faculty review and evaluation shall include: Peer evaluations Self\u2010evaluations Student evaluation of teaching Evaluation by the supervisor based on observation and, when available, on the evidence of achievement in teaching or professional performance and on such teaching materials as course outlines, examinations, and supplementary materials. Faculty members will have an opportunity to submit material they desire to be considered in the evaluation. In the self-evaluation portion of the form called \u201CQuality Improvement\u201D, the individual lists their specific contributions to objectives that are aligned with the Northark Strategic Plan. Faculty performance evaluation also includes formal student assessment at the conclusion of each course. Faculty receives results of the assessment and appraisal that aid in decisions for improvements to course instruction. Before mid\u2010term of each new faculty member\u2019s first appointment, the faculty member will be notified by the chair of his or her department of the criteria, procedures, and instruments currently used to evaluate performance. After the evaluation process, the supervisor and faculty member will meet to review the evaluation and the evaluation will be signed by both parties. The evaluation form will include a space for the faculty member to respond to the chair\u2019s recommendations. As long as a faculty member is employed by North Arkansas College and for at least three years thereafter, evaluations, recommendations, and all other writings used in or resulting from the evaluation of that faculty member will be maintained and made available to the faculty member upon written request by the faculty member. The written request for these materials must be made to the faculty member\u2019s current or former supervisor or, when unavailable, by written request to the Vice President of Academic and Student Affairs. Each year each faculty supervisor is required to conduct an evaluation of the performance of all faculty members in their division or department and ensure compliance with all criteria and procedures for evaluation. If the evaluation process identifies a problem, the supervisor shall provide the faculty member with a written report indicating any problem(s) identified and solutions planned, if necessary. The process to gather evaluative information includes the following: How are faculty peers involved in faculty performance? The performance evaluation form for full-time faculty includes a section for peer evaluation. How are students involved in faculty performance? Faculty performance evaluation also includes formal student assessment at the conclusion of each course. Faculty receives results of the assessment and appraisal that aid in decisions for improvements to course instruction. How are administrators involved in faculty performance? Before mid\u2010term of each new faculty member\u2019s first appointment, the faculty member will be notified by the chair of his or her department of the criteria, procedures, and instruments currently used to evaluate performance. After the evaluation process, the supervisor and faculty member will meet to review the evaluation and the evaluation will be signed by both parties. The evaluation form will include a space for the faculty member to respond to the chair\u2019s recommendations. How do faculty members self-evaluate their performance? The performance evaluation includes a section for self-evaluation. In the self-evaluation portion of the form called \u201CQuality Improvement\u201D, the individual lists their specific contributions to objectives that are aligned with the Northark Strategic Plan. Describe how faculty knowledge and use of student support tools (i.e. early alert) and advising techniques (i.e. intrusive advising) are used to evaluate faculty performance. North Arkansas College uses an early alert system to notify Student Services of any student success issues. At mid-term faculty submit grades for all students. Faculty advising begins when students complete their first semester. This includes registering students for classes for the following semester. Chairs and deans note the advisee load and strive to make it equitable. Faculty advising is included as a criterion in the rank and promotion evaluation process. Describe any other activities used to evaluate faculty performance. A classroom visitation evaluation is conducted by the faculty supervisor and is used in conjunction with the chair or program director evaluations. Institutional Monitoring of the Faculty Performance Review Process Does the institution monitor the annual faculty review process? X Yes ___No If yes, describe the procedures and persons responsible for the monitoring. Northark faculty use the current Faculty Evaluation Forms and process to evaluate work performance.\u201D Supervisors are held accountable when evaluations are not completed by a specific date each year. New employment contracts for the next fiscal year are not written or delivered for signature and approval to the returning non-classified employee until an evaluation with a satisfactory rating has been delivered to the employee and a copy in Human Resources. If no, describe measures that are being taken to begin annual monitoring. Use of Review Findings How are faculty performance results used in decisions related to promotions, salary increases or job tenure? Faculty have a Rank and Promotion process that is separate from the annual performance evaluation process. Faculty evaluation results are used to determine the amount of merit bonuses in years when merit bonuses are given. The Faculty Compensation Committee reviews\/approves the applications for rank and promotion. Supervisor and student evaluations are part of what is submitted with the application. Describe how faculty performance results are used at your institution to guide short and long-term faculty development. Chairs and deans discuss possible opportunities for faculty development if there is a trend or gap in evaluations and student success rates. In addition, the assessment of student learning outcomes is also reviewed for departmental action plans on an annual basis. Any faculty development needs are shared with the Faculty Coordinator of the Center for Teaching and Learning who coordinates faculty development during the academic year. Based on faculty performance results, identify the following area(s) of improvement that are being examined for next academic year. North Arkansas College has moved to the Canvas Learning Management System in completely in the fall of 2019. Faculty are being trained on the additional ways that the tools provided by the Canvas system can but used to maximize the learning experience. Additional training in how to effectively engage students in a remote yet live environment such as zoom is being performed. With the Coronavirus 19 (Covid-19), alternative ways of the traditional teaching modes were challenged. The end result is that the enrichment of the educational processes and curriculum will be evaluated to help define and develop a safe and effective way of course and subject matter delivery while social distancing is required for student, faculty and staff. English Fluency of Teaching Faculty How do students and administrators review the English fluency of all teaching faculty\u2014full-time, part-time, and graduate teaching assistants? When new faculty are hired, they must demonstrate effective communication skills in the teaching demonstration as well as the interview process. Course evaluations that students complete for existing faculty are reviewed for effective communication. What measures are in place to assist deficient faculty in becoming English proficient? We provide additional support through the Northark Center for Teaching and Learning for faculty development in instructional delivery best practices in the event communication is ineffective. Professional development opportunities exist at the departmental level as well. Summarize English deficiency findings and note action taken by the institution. None were identified in this or the previous review cycle. Support for Accredited Public Schools Four-Year Institutions: Describe how did the College of Education and related discipline faculty members at your institution work collaboratively with accredited public schools in Arkansas this academic year. Two-Year Institutions: Describe how did the institution\u2019s related discipline faculty members work collaboratively with accredited public schools in Arkansas this academic year. Northark Education faculty work with public schools to provide observation sites for freshmen students. While North Arkansas College does not have a College of Education, we support, work closely, and partner with our area public schools. Notable Findings and Future Plans List any notable findings from the annual faculty review process conducted during the year that may have implications for future annual faculty reviews. Faculty advising This year the faculty evaluation instrument contained formulas that calculates rubric scores to remove subjectivity from the evaluation. Due to the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic before the cycle was complete, and only one advising cycle was able to be observed, it was determined that another year of observation would occur on this. Describe any plans or revisions to the annual faculty review process this year that have been developed as a result of the following: Notable findings listed above (see question #1) Logistical plan for including faculty advising in the workload. As mentioned in question 1 above, this will be evaluated. Just as the advising processes was about to start the College took Covid-19 preventative measures. No full or fair evaluation could be made with only one cycle and subsequent reviews being done. This will be evaluated again in the next cycle. b. the institutional placement plan The following institutional placement policy and procedures are in place. In accordance with Arkansas law, first time, degree-seeking students are tested in Math, English, and Reading and are placed in classes based on test scores and other criteria. North Arkansas College adopts appropriate placement measures which are supported by student success data. North Arkansas College develops an institutional placement plan for Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The College accepts ACT, Accuplacer, COMPASS and ASSET scores for placement purposes. In addition, high school GPA, duration from last mathematics or English course, and\/or a non-cognitive instrument are considered. Northark requires that full-time, degree-seeking students who are placed into college preparatory classes register for those classes upon initial enrollment at the college and continue in course sequence (e.g., Composition I followed immediately by Composition II.) Mathematics and English faculties will determine placement scores and multiple measure criteria for advising purposes. In addition, a placement guide with scores is in place as a reference point for advisors and faculty to utilize when advising students. c. the productivity funding formula On the faculty self-evaluation, retention\/completion rates are provided by the chairs and program directors. The rates are for institutional rates, departmental rates, and instructor rates. The faculty will compare their individual rates and determine action plans, if needed, to meet or exceed standards for the institution and department. Level of Faculty Satisfaction with Current Process On the scale below, indicate the faculty\u2019s overall sense of satisfaction with the annual review process. If the rating is low (1 or 2), briefly describe corrective measures that will be implemented. 1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---10 low high Locations & Directions 870.743.3000 Webmaster Contact Vendor Information Employment Opportunities ACT 852 Economic Security Report Facility Reservations ?
