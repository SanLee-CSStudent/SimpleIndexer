News News A- A+ Northeast Alabama Community College Celebrates Spring Fling 2022 May 18, 2022 Pictured are students enjoying the Spring Fling activities. Students at Northeast Alabama Community College (NACC) celebrated the first Spring Fling event in two years from April 25th-29th. Sponsored by NACC\u2019s Student Government Association (SGA), the week-long celebration of activities kicked-off with an event in the quad, where students enjoyed free Chick-Fil-A sandwiches, yard games, and music. The theme for the week was \u201CNew Beginnings\u201D, and the SGA\u2019s goal was to involve as many students as possible to encourage them to return to campus and enjoy the many activities offered at NACC. On Tuesday, the Rotaract Club hosted its own event, where students and faculty took part in an \u201CAlmost Golf\u201D tournament. On Wednesday, dozens of students took part in volleyball and tennis tournaments. There were eight volleyball teams and six tennis teams participating. The honor societies on campus also play an important role in student activities. To show their representation, Sigma Kappa Delta (SKD) and Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) held their semester inductions on Thursday with more than one hundred people in attendance. Finally, the week ended with karaoke and dance-off competitions in the student center. Joan Reeves, Director of Student Activities, commented, \u201CThis week reminded me of the kinds of events we held before 2020, and it was so gratifying to see students and faculty enjoying themselves again. I think we have all missed being able to participate in the many activities NACC offers its students.\u201D For more information about Northeast Alabama Community College, visit nacc.edu or download the OneACCS app in the Apple Store or Google Play Store.
