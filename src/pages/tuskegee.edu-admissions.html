We know that choosing a college major can be overwhelming. But don't worry! Your choice of major will not lock you into a specific career for the rest of your life. That said, you WILL spend a lot of time in whatever subject you choose. Consider these factors when selecting a major: Career Readiness Choose a major because it will prepare you for a specific career path or advanced study. Maybe you already know that you want to be a nurse, a day trader, or a web developer. Before you declare a major, take a class or two in the relevant discipline, check out the syllabus for an advanced seminar, and talk to students in the department of your choice. Make sure you're ready for the coursework needed for the career of your dreams. Earning Potential Future earning potential is worth considering - college is a big investment, and while college can pay you back in many ways beyond salary, this can be a major factor for students who are paying their own way or taking out loans. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the majors that lead to the highest salaries include just about any type of engineering, actuarial mathematics, computer science, agriculture, physics, statistics, health, architecture, veterinary medicine and economics. Subjects You Love Some students choose a major simply because they love the subject. If you love what you're studying, you're more than likely to fully engage your classes and college experience, and that can mean better grades and great relationships with others in your field. If your calling is philosophy or education, don't write it off just because you're not sure about graduate school, or what the market holds for philosophers and teachers. Many liberal arts and education majors provide sudents with critical thinking skills and writing skills that are highly valued by employers. Career Development and Placement Services Tuskegee University has more than 60 degree programs that can help you reach your career goals. If you feel that you need extra help to select a major, our staff in Academic Advising and the Career Development and Placement Services Department are eager to help you. Got Questions?
