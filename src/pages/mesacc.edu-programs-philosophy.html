Field of Interest Do you find yourself asking the big questions about life and searching for meaningful answers? If you\u2019ve ever wondered if we perceive the world accurately or what makes an action wrong, philosophy \u2014 meaning \u201Clove of wisdom\u201D in Greek \u2014 could be your calling. The Philosophy program can help open your mind to understanding diverse world views while giving you the tools to examine the human condition in depth. Not only that, but it will also equip you with analytical skills most employers find invaluable. You\u2019ll develop the ability to think logically and read carefully with a critical eye as you study with experts who teach you to spot faulty reasoning \u2014 and how to avoid it in your writing and work. What you learn in the Philosophy program will give you valuable, foundational skills that can transfer to future studies in other disciplines, such as law, social sciences, the humanities, and public policy, if you continue your education at a four-year school. Take the first step to creating a new reality in the Philosophy program. Start your journey today. Transfer Degree Want to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree?
