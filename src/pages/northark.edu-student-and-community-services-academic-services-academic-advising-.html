Advisors are here to help you build your academic plan and work toward meeting your education and career goals. Advising empowers you to create and achieve those goals while receiving accurate information and guidance throughout the journey. All Northark students are required to visit with an advisor before enrolling in courses. New students will be advised by a professional advisor to choose a major of study and create their own academic plan. Depending on each student\u2019s chosen major, he or she may then be assigned to a faculty advisor to meet with during subsequent semesters. Check out our Pioneer Guide to Graduation Map for a successful journey to completing your degree. See your advisor for information about a specific program. When To See Your Advisor To register for classes for the upcoming semester. To explore interests and make a realistic and purposeful decision about your academic, career and life goals. To get referrals to campus offices, instructors as well as community organizations and public benefit offerings. To get an understanding of the College\u2019s academic curricula, degree plans, policies and procedures. To add or drop classes. To change your major. For help in filling out a financial aid appeal. For any question or concern you may have. - Advisors have lots of answers and know many people on campus. If an advisor doesn\u2019t know an answer, you can count on them to find someone else who might know.
