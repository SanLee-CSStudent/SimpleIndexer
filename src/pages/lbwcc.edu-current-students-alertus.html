This emergency notification system will be used by the College to notify students, faculty, and staff of emergency situations at all LBW locations. Saints Alert, the current CampusCast software, will end spring 2022. Currently, LBWCC has the Alertus desktop notification system installed on all computers at all locations. Alertus also has a mobile app that all employees and students need to install. The mobile app will be used to send alerts to employees and students of emergency and severe weather alerts. This system may also be used to send critical alerts about possible college closings and information dealing with student admission and financial aid. For this system to be successful, the College needs all employees and students to install the mobile app on your personal phone.
