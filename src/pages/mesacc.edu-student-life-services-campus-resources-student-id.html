Get Your Student ID To obtain a Student ID a student must have a valid photo ID such as a driver's license. There is no charge for your first Student ID, but a fee of $5 will be charged for replacement cards. You will be photographed at the time you apply for your student ID. You may not wear a hat for your photo so be sure to fix your hair first! Please note, you must also be registered for class at least 24 hours before a Student ID can be generated. Where to Go Student IDs are available from the Enrollment Center, building 39, at the Southern and Dobson campus, or in the Mesquite building inside Enrollment Services at the Red Mountain campus. Why Do You Need an ID? These cards should be carried on campus and will be required for library use and some class use. Remember you can also take advantage of \"Student Discounts\" at movies, museums, and theme parks by having a current Student ID!
