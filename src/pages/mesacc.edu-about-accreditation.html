Higher Learning Commission 230 South LaSalle Street, Suite 7-500 Chicago, IL 60604 800.621.7440 Open Pathway The HLC offers institutions multiple options for maintaining their accreditation, called pathways. MCC is on the Open Pathway for accreditation. The Open Pathway follows on a 10-year cycle focused on quality assurance and institutional improvement: Years 1-3: Prepare Assurance Filing Year 4: Assurance Review Years 5-9: Quality Initiative Years 7-9: Prepare for 10-year HLC Comprehensive Evaluation Visit Year 10: Comprehensive Evaluation for Reaffirmation of Accreditation MCC completed it's last accreditation cycle in 2015 with a comprehensive evaluation. As a result of this successful evaluation, the HLC continued the accreditation of MCC with the next Reaffirmation of Accreditation scheduled for 2024-25. MCC's progress in our current Open Pathway cycle is outlined below. Assurance As part of the HLC's Open Pathway, MCC completed an Assurance Review in 2019. This review was accepted by the HLC with a determination that MCC meets all HLC Criteria for Accreditation. MCC's next Assurance Review will occur as part of a comprehensive evaluation in 2024-25. Institutional Improvement After completing a successful assurance review in 2019, MCC chose to showcase the important work of student outcomes assessment by participating in the HLC Assessment Academy as our college Quality Initiative. Members of MCC\u2019s Assessment Academy team attended a virtual HLC results forum in Fall 2021 to present our results, and the HLC accepted the team\u2019s final report as fulfilling MCC\u2019s Quality Initiative requirement. MCC's focus during this five-year project was to increase faculty participation in student outcomes assessment, create a systematic approach to assessing student learning outcomes, and to develop assessment expertise within the co-curricular and student service areas MCC's quality initiative from its previous accreditation cycle (2006-2015) was called informed improvement, which empowers a culture of evidence-based decision-making dedicated to advancing student success. Informed improvement acknowledges the 21st century community college\u2019s greatly increased capacity to gather and analyze relevant data, and to deploy that information to make the most effective use of the college\u2019s resources. Placing an iterative process of critical inquiry at the heart of every college unit\u2019s planning processes, informed improvement is premised upon the realization that every aspect of the college contributes to student learning and success. In January of 2015, MCC received a Quality Initiative Recommendation indicating that the HLC formally accepted its informed improvement initiative as having completed the Quality Initiative requirement. In the report, the HLC praised the college's \"focused purpose and excellent work.\" There were many outcomes of the project that drew praise, especially the shift in the college's culture and processes toward evidence-based decision-making dedicated to student success.
