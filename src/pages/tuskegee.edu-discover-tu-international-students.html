Admission Criteria ? Criteria for International Students Criteria for International Students International applicants are those that are not U.S. citizens and have either obtained or in the process of obtaining some class of visa (typically an F-1 student visa). An international student will be classified as either an International Freshman or an International Transfer. Introduction There are two immigration-related terms which you will see frequently: \"entry visa\" and \"immigration status\". The first term, entry visa, refers to the entry visa affixed or stamped in your passport that permits you to enter the United States. This stamp is obtained at a U.S. Consulate. Your entry visa is used only for entries to the U.S. and may expire during your stay with no repercussions. The second term, immigration status, reflects the most recent notation on your I-94 Arrival\/Departure Record, commonly known as the I-94 Card. Your immigration status is generally the same as your entry visa classification: F-1, B-2, J-1, etc. The I-94 Card you receive upon entering the U.S. is proof of immigration status (non-immigrant classification) in the U.S. and specifies the length of time one is permitted to stay. When you arrive in the U.S., the customs or immigration official will retain the Arrival portion of the I-94, make notes concerning the immigration status (non-immigrant classification) on the Departure portion, and either insert or staple the I-94 (Departure) Card into the passport, usually next to the page that holds the corresponding entry visa. Important Information Applications from international students will not be considered until all materials, including WES or ECE evaluation, TOEFL or IELTS, and application fee have been received by the Office of Admissions. All documents and supporting materials must be sent to the Office of Admissions at least three months in advance of the students proposed entrance. Steps to Apply Submit your Admissions Application Submit your $35 non-refundable application fee Submit your official high school, college, and\/or university transcripts to World Education Services (WES) or Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE) for evaluation; a course-by-coures and grade point average evaluation is required. Students are required to pay the processing fees to WES or ECE. Evaluated transcripts should be mailed directly to Tuskegee University from WES or ECE. If applicable, submit your official transcript(s) from all U.S. colleges and\/or universities attended. Submit your official test scores from the International English Language Testing System (IELTS); Minimum 5.0 or Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL); Minimum of 62 (Internet-based) or 500 (Paper-based). Submit a Financial Affidavit of support and supporting bank letter. Submit your SAT 1 or ACT test scores If applicable, submit results of an English as a Second Language (ESOL) Program from all U.S. Colleges or Universities attended. Please note: The application will be evaluated only when all of the required documents have been received. Electronic documents such as email, fax and photocopies are not acceptable. Tuskegee University welcomes applications from prospective students living outside the US. Applying internationally, however, is a bit more complex. International students must meet standards, just as others, for admission. Tuskegee University accepts World Education System (WES) credential evaluations or Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE) from non-U.S. schools to evaluate their international transcript. The WES or ECE form is required since their evaluations standardize the various academic credentials from around the world. If you still have questions or need advice, please contact the Tuskegee University Office of Admissions. Test Scores For information and applications for the ACT, apply online by using the registration form at http:\/\/www.act.org. For information and applications for SAT, apply online by using the registration form at http:\/\/www.collegeboard.org Tuskegee University Institutional Test Codes: ACT: 0050 SAT 1: 1813 TOEFL: 1813 Required Supporting Financial Documentation International applicants must provide sufficient financial documentation reflecting their ability to fund their education while attending the University. Various documents are required depending on the source of financial support to include the following: Personal Funds \u2013 An official bank letter on bank letterhead showing available funds to meet all expenses (tuition, fees, housing, transportation, and personal expenses). Parent or Family Support \u2013 An official bank letter on bank letterhead showing available funds to meet all expenses (tuition, fees, housing, transportation, and personal expenses), name, address, and relationship; An affidavit of support providing the amount, and the number of years the funding is guaranteed and renewable. An International Organization, Government Agency, Foundation, or Another University- A certified copy of the official sponsorship letter stating the conditions of the award, amount of the award, name and address of the sponsor, and the period for which funding is guaranteed and renewable. Tuskegee University- A copy of your award letter. Private Sponsor- A certified letter from your sponsor explaining the relationship, why he or she is committed to provide support, an official bank letter showing available funds to meet all expenses (tuition, fees, housing, transportation, and personal expenses), and the period for which funding is guaranteed or renewable. Please note: Available funds must equal or exceed your expenses and total cost of attendance for that given year. Funds translated into U.S. dollars. Financial documentation dated three (3) months prior to proposed entrance. Students entering with dependents must add $4,000 per dependent for preparation of I-20. If you have more than one funding source, provide documentation for each source. Applying for Student Visa In order to apply for a student visa to enroll into Tuskegee University, you must receive acceptance as a full-time student, and issued a Form I-20. The Form I-20 is to apply for F-1 Student Visa status at a U.S. Consulate or Embassy in your country of residence. If you are already in the United States, you must complete all appropriate forms for change of non-immigrant status or follow the procedures to transfer your F-1 status to the University. Steps to Apply for F-1 Visa: Fill out the Non-immigrant Visa Application (Form DS-160). Pay the application fee. Fees vary depending on the type of Visa from which you are applying. Pay the SEVIS I-901 fee. Schedule F-1 interview with the U.S. Consulate or Embassy. Due to the possibility of long wait time, schedule the interview as early as possible. This interview is a mandatory step in the process. Compile a document file with required documents to include a photograph, valid passport, proof of payment of application and fees, proof of acceptance into the University, medical records, and proof of financial support. Attend the Interview. Be on time with all required documents. Wait for Processing. Processing time can range from a few days to a few months. You will receive notification of Approval or Denial. Make travel arrangements after approval of the Visa Process. Your accompanying spouse and children may apply for F-2 Visa statuses as dependents. Provide sufficient financial documentation allowing for additional funding to cover their expenses. F-1 Student Classification Those who hold F-1 student visas are normally admitted to the U.S. for \"Duration of Status (D\/S)\" by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) which is the U.S. government agency responsible for administering regulations related to the entry of non-U.S. citizens. Under the terms of a student visa, you are required to pursue a full-time course of study during the academic year, August through May. For BCBP purposes, Tuskegee University commonly defines full-time study as those registered for 12 or more credits or one Residence Unit each semester. Students in F-1 status may work on campus part-time (up to 20 hours per week) with the permission of the International Programs Office (IPO). A student may apply for permission to work off campus only after 9 months in F-1 status. This requires the prior written approval of the IPO and the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS). Employment during either the academic year or the summer should not be considered a major means of support while at Tuskegee unless the University offers employment in the form of a teaching or research assistantship. Dependents holding F-2 status may NOT work under any circumstances. A major academic and financial benefit for many students in F-1 status is eligibility to apply for various forms of practical training (employment directly related to your field of study). However, please note that one must be a full-time student in an immigration status appropriate for studying for at least the previous nine consecutive months to be considered for practical training.
