We recognize that creative teaching occurs with or without the assistance of technology and dismiss the premise that the mere integration of technology into the instructional process conveys, on its own, creativity. Our definition of creative teaching transcends the delivery medium and, instead, tightly focuses on the instructional process and message. Whether you choose to engage in creative classroom practices with a piece of chalk or from behind a lectern, we want to assist you in achieving your goals through: Instructional Technology Support Instructional Design and Canvas Support Technology Equipment and Resources Captioning and Assistive Technology Innovative Teaching Spaces Professional Development Programs Personal Consultations with Our Staff Malone Center for Excellence in Teaching Instructional Technology Toolkit Instructional Design and Canvas Support Equipment and Resources Captioning and Assistive Technology Teaching Spaces Professional Development Programs Contact Us Colleges Graduate Policies Graduate Studies Human and Animal Subjects Research UM 101 Undergraduate Minors University Bulletin Experiential Learning Library Are you ready?
