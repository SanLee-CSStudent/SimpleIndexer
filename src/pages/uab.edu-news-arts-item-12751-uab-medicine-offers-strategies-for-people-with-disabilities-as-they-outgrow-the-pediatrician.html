Written by: Tehreem Khan Media contact: Anna Jones Transitioning from pediatric to adult health care can be a difficult experience for individuals who have complex or chronic medical conditions. To help ease the transition, the University of Alabama at Birmingham and United Ability are hosting the Staging Transition for Every Patient program event on Saturday, May 7, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the United Ability\u2019s LINCPoint Adult Program Building located at 101 Oslo Circle, Birmingham, AL 35211. At this event, patients and their caregivers can learn more about UAB Medicine\u2019s STEP program, which helps people with ongoing medical issues move from pediatric to adult health care. The STEP program provides primary care services, helps identify adult specialists, assists with care coordination and locates additional services in the community that fit each patient\u2019s unique needs. The goal of this program is to prevent interruptions in medical care and provide support services \u2014 such as physical therapy, social workers, counseling and emergency planning \u2014 within a single primary care setting. Patients and their caregivers will get the chance to connect with medical staff, social workers, vocational rehab, therapists and more. Opportunities to visit with many types of services will be offered at booths and breakout sessions. Lunch will be provided. Some of the topics that will be addressed during the event include transitioning through the education system, attending college, working, housing, financial planning and attendant care, among others. The event is free to everyone ages 14-30 who were born with a disability or developed a disability, and their caregivers. Health care providers can also attend the event for $100. Register for the event by visiting go.uab.edu\/STEP. For those who are unable to attend in person, Alabama Care will be live-streaming some of the event on their Facebook page. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
