At this time, there should be no adverse consequences of relocating to any state where UM\u2019s main campus is not located while enrolled at UM since all states now meet state authorization requirements under 34 CFR 600.9. Students have access to a complaint process. This student complaint process is available so that the concerns and complaints of students are addressed fairly and resolved promptly. Students must fully exhaust their rights under UM\u2019s official complaint process.

It has been confirmed that the MBA program does not lead to professional licensure or certifications and, therefore, should not have any adverse outcome regardless of state of residency. With regard to all other distance education programs that may lead to professional licensure or certification application, UM has developed a series of tables to provide this information that will continuously be updated once information becomes available or changes. If you are interested in learning about professional licensure or certification requirements specific to your program and your specified state of residency, please review the tables found here: https:\/\/www.montevallo.edu\/about-um\/administration\/academic-affairs\/professional-licensure-and-certification\/.

Notice of Federal Student Financial Aid Penalties for Drug Law Violations On December 27, 2020, the FAFSA Simplification Act (Act) was enacted into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, making many important changes to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA¢ç). Sec. 484 of the HEA was amended to remove suspension of eligibility for Title IV aid for drug-related convictions that occurred while receiving Title IV aid. To make Title IV aid accessible to as many students as soon as possible, the Department of Education (Department) will implement these changes in three phases across three award years: The 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 award years. While the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 FAFSAs will continue to have the drug-related convictions questions, with a requirement for the student to provide correct answers, these questions will not impact\u202Fthe student\u2019s Expected Family Contribution\u202F(EFC). The 2023-2024 FAFSA will no longer include drug-related convictions questions.
