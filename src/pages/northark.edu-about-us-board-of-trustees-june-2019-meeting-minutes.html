Chair Bill Lovell called the meeting to order at 3:00 p.m. Trustees Kevin Cheri, R.G. Earnest, David Evans, Chris McNew, Scott Miller, Sarah Newman, and Don Tomlinson were present. North Arkansas College personnel attending included Sarah Bing, Meagan Isaacs, Brandon Come, Kris Greening, Tavonda Brown, Dr. Laura Berry, Savannah Wickey, Jennifer Marshall, Dr. Donna Wood, Micki Somers, Katie Vaughn, Scott Howie, Joe Berry, Dr. Rodney Arnold, Don Sugg, and Dr. Randy Esters. Also in attendance were James White of the Harrison Daily Times and Dr. Rick Massengale. Approval of Agenda Chair Lovell asked if there were any changes to the agenda. There being none, the agenda stood approved. Regular Reports Finance Report\u2014Don Sugg presented current revenues and expenses through 31 May 2019, which is 92% of the fiscal year. Revenue for the fiscal year will be at $14,350,000 if only the expected state funds are received through the end of June. He projected the E&G to have a net gain of approximately $600,000 to $800,000, but warned that things can change a lot in June. The E&G fund is at 98% budgeted revenue and 88% of budget expenses. Both are up over previous years, with expenses up mainly due to inflation and some salary changes. The Auxiliary fund looks to finish with a deficit, currently at $7,648. There are outstanding expenses for June, but also revenue from summer camps. Revenue and expenses will likely both finish the financial year under budget. Title III\u2014Sarah Bing presented the annual report for the end of Year 2 of a five year grant. The goal of 540 unduplicated students taking advantage of tutoring services by the end of the grant is on track to exceed the goal, with 306 students in Year 2 alone. Previously, the highest number had been 99 students in an academic year. Tutoring will be available throughout the summer, which will help more students access the service. Of students surveyed, 60% rated the tutoring services 4 out of 4 stars. Supplemental funding was used for the Civil Conversation Series, which served a recorded 235 individual students; 30 of those returned to the LRC for tutoring. 99% of students surveyed have rated the LRC four or five stars, with five as the highest rating. All student intake forms are in an electronic format, and everything should be taken care of through Colleague starting Fall 2020. Finance will be implementing the new system as of July 1. Colleague should help with student tracking, enabling the identification of at-risk students and linking them with the appropriate resources. President\u2019s Report\u2014Dr. Randy Esters shared that Northark has selected the Open Pathway for the next reaccreditation cycle, which will see the first report due in the fourth year. Recent events have included Commencement, health professions pinnings, and GED graduation. Scott Bull from PACE Industries delivered the keynote address at graduation, which was made special for Dr. Esters by his son\u2019s graduation. He noted how thankful we are to have such great connections with local industry leaders, as evidenced by our connection with Scott Bull and the recent announcement of internships with FedEx. The latter does not typically partner with 2-year colleges, so this internship is an exciting opportunity for our students. There were already seven applicants from the first posting on social media. Northark was recently named the 24th most affordable 2-year college in the country with online degree programs. We have also become the 3rd school in the nation to become a FANUC Authorized Satellite Training (FAST) facility. FANUC is a world leader in robotics, and this partnership will serve our state well by offering advanced training not available elsewhere. Dr. Esters reminded everyone of the loss of Allen Buberwa last month, and shared while our international students are having a tremendous impact on the College and community, Northark is truly making a difference around the world. He shared a picture sent from the Buberwa family which showed Allen\u2019s burial site covered in cards sent from his Northark family. This summer, the Foundation will present three movies on campus for the community. There will be a new event this year, the Battle of the Bands, held in conjunction with the Summer Movie Series. Dr. Esters offered his congratulations to Shari Holt for being named Outstanding Staff Member and Kim Potts for being named Outstanding Faculty Member. Dr. Esters updated the Trustees on the status of the Center Campus, saying that the bond attorney told us ownership of the Durand Center could transfer to a private entity providing the funds received are used to either pay toward the bond or used for a capital project within two years. The proposals must take into account Fair Market Value, which includes the appraisal and how the property would be used in the future. The Durand Center costs approximately $300,000 to operate, and keeping it solely to operate a convention center is not within the mission of the college. Tuesday, June 25th, is the deadline for proposals. Dr. Esters said that while he regrets losing the Center Campus, he believes that we have been diligent in exploring every avenue and will not look back with regret over how we came to a decision about how best to move forward. Consent Agenda The Consent Agenda included the May Regular Meeting minutes, 2019-2020 Contract Renewal, Replacement Position\u2014VPASA, New Position\u2014Work Based Learning Coordinator, Board Travel Expense Resolution 2019-2020, and Provisional Continuation. Chair Lovell reminded the Board that everything had been covered at the breakfast, with the exception of the Provisional Continuation. However, that information was sent out earlier in the week. He asked for a motion to approve the Consent Agenda. A motion was made by Trustee Evans, seconded by Trustee Cheri, and unanimously passed. Dr. Esters then introduced Dr. Rick Massengale as the new Vice President following Dr. Wood\u2019s retirement effective June 30th. He said Dr. Massengale comes highly recommended and will be a great addition to the Northark family. Monitoring Report Dr. Donna Wood presented the Monitoring Report on \u201CEngagement: Enhance Diverse Experiences.\u201D New Initiatives include Increased Learning Activities, Civil conversations, Study Abroad, and Increased International Student Population. Dr. Wood reported that we have a mannequin of color for training in the Health Professions department, and students are being introduced to cultural situations in the simulation lab. The international students have also taken part in simulations. The Civil Conversations Series included presentations from AIDS activist Ruth Coker Burks, white civil-rights advocate Bob Zellner, Holocaust survivor Inge Auerbach, LGBTQ advocate Staff Sergeant Eric Alwa (USMC, Ret.), \u201CThe Farm\u201D cofounder Douglas Stephenson, and Animal Planet\u2019s Jeff Corwin. The Study Abroad was in Italy and took a group of 28 college and community members. The trip highlighted art, cultural anthropology, and history throughout Italy. Results are measured via CCSSE and the PACE surveys. General Learning questions addressing diverse issues for students have shown growth across the board; however, encouraging contact has been flat and Dr. Wood noted that we have some work to do in that area. Minority groups have shown an increase of 3.3% from Fall 2016 to Fall 2018, and graduation rates have shown an increase. The PACE survey for staff has shown an 11% increase from 2012 to 2018 in effectively promoting diversity. Trustee McNew asked if there are plans to continue the Civil Conversations Series. Dr. Esters answered that the series has been funded by the Title III grant, and although it will depend on the availability of funding we hope to continue the series with two speakers per year. New Business No new business. Board Comments Chair Lovell welcomed Dr. Rick Massengale as the new Vice President of Academic and Student Affairs, then asked the Trustees if they had any comments. There being none, Trustee Miller made a motion to adjourn. The motion passed unanimously, and the meeting adjourned at 3:48 p.m. Locations & Directions 870.743.3000 Webmaster Contact Vendor Information Employment Opportunities ACT 852 Economic Security Report Facility Reservations ?
