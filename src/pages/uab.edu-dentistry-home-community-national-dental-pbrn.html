Essentially, it is \u201Cpractical science\u201D done for the benefit of \u201Creal world\u201D clinical practices. The network builds upon clinicians\u2019 observations from their own practices, gets them engaged in discussions with other practitioners about scientific approaches, and then establishes scientific consensus that is clinically meaningful and relevant to patient treatment. Their work expedites the application of scientific discoveries into routine, everyday clinical practice. The major source of funding for the nation's network is the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).
