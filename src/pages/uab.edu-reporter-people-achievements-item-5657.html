Wdowiak, who taught and conducted research at UAB for nearly 30 years, was a member of NASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Rover project, and he operated the crucial M?ssbauer spectrometers onboard MERs Spirit and Opportunity rovers that helped uncover firm evidence that water once existed on Mars. \"Tom Wdowiak was a member of our team from the very beginning, and we wanted to honor him after his passing,\u201D said John Callas, Ph.D., project manager of NASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Rover project. \"We wanted to find a significant feature to name after him.\u201D In a Tuscaloosa News article, James Rice, Ph.D., UAB alumnus and geology team leader for NASA rover Opportunity, said the ridge was named for Wdowiak a couple of months ago. More than 20 rocks on the ridge were named for places relevant to Wdowiak\u2019s work and professional life. Opportunity, the nearly 11-year-old rover, approached the ridge last month and captured a panoramic image of newly named Wdowiak Ridge and the view from it. Wdowiak Ridge, pictured here, stands prominently on the western rim of Mars\u2019 Endeavour crater, about 200 yards west of the rim's main crest line. The pancam on the Mars rover Opportunity recorded the component images for this mosaic Sept. 17, 2014. It is visible from overhead in the map from the northeastern end near the rover's Sol 3751 location to Odyssey Crater near the rover's Sol 3789 location. The rover is there studying rocks that were tossed outward by an impact that dug a crater 100 feet wide into the southern end of the ridge. Scientists are exploring the ridge and how it fits into the geologic story of the region. Opportunity and its twin rover Spirit landed on the surface of Mars in January 2004. Spirit stopped sending data in 2010, and Opportunity was joined by the Curiosity rover in August 2012.
