We will present our course offering with face to face and online offerings to meet the needs of our students. Our fall courses will offer a traditional, face-to-face courses and will have elements of remote learning to allow for physical distancing and minimize crowding in facilities. It is extremely important that you check your NWTI email (NWTI student email) regularly. Your instructors will begin sending out important information to you regarding class format and scheduling before class begins and will continue to communicate with you throughout the semester via your NWTI email. Contact your academic advisor or your department chair if you have any questions about your schedule. All NWTI fall semester classes will begin Aug. 24, 2020. NWTI Fall 2020 Reopen Protocol While there is no \u201Cone-size-fits-all\u201D solution, we are moving forward in careful consideration with plans to reopen Northwest Technical Institute\u2019s campus. Our goal is to reopen the safest and best ways we can based on Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and protocols within our NWTI operations. What does this mean for reopening our campus to start in the fall? What issues should be considered to ensure the safety of students and faculty and still provide quality instruction? This working plan allows NWTI to reopen with all programs on August 24, 2020. This plan will hopefully minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19, and allow more flexibility to operate without sacrificing the quality of education. Levels of operation-Plans A, B, and C Plan A- Normal operation of students attending class for face-to-face learning Plan B -Allows students to have both classroom and virtual learning (Blended learning) Plan C- Allows for all virtual learning platforms if COVID-19 increases in our area and the governor closes institutions Returning to campus for lab hours will be addressed when needed and it is safe for students to return to campus Fall Learning Platform- The fall schedule will allow students to use PLAN B, the blended and synchronous learning models. Most of the lab activities will be performed using Plan A. Some programs may use virtual simulation. Students will divided into two (2) groups A and B. One week, group A students will be in class three (3) days a week and group B will be in class for two (2) days. The following week, group B will be in class for three (3) days and group A will be in class for two (2) days. Both will be synchronous and blended learning platforms. Synchronous Learning\u2013 all students receiving classroom information at the same time Blended learning\u2013 Combination of virtual and in class learning Program Orientation- Each department will deliver program orientation in groups or virtual platform. The Student Services Director will announce how general orientation will be delivered. Attendance- Students will follow the attendance policy of their department.

Student or Faculty Illness Protocol For COVID- 19 It someone becomes ill with any symptoms, send them home immediately. Do not ask nursing to evaluate unless an emergency exists. SEND THEM HOME! Any students, faculty or staff with respiratory symptoms regardless of the cause or claim must not be allowed in the building Active coughing or sneezing will be sent home Complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain, cough and fever need to go home and be quarantined for 14 days unless has negative COVID-19 test results Students, faculty or staff found with confirmed case of COVID-19 will cause the CDC institutions of Higher Education Decision Tree to be launched May require temporary shutdown of building and facility Will require clean\/Disinfect protocol Consultation with local health department for contacts and tracing Those who have been in direct contact with someone with COVID will be required to stay home for 14 days and be tested. If test comes back negative and there are no symptoms, they may return to school. They must be symptom- free and free of fever three (3) days prior to returning. If the test comes back positive, a 14 day quarantine is required and can only return to campus free of all symptoms, including fever free 3 days after last fever, without any medication. Two negative test results are required. Those who have indirect contact. (Child\u2019s teacher tested positive and your child lives with you). No test is required for you unless the child (direct contact) has a positive test. You will need to be tested and quarantine until you get results. If results are negative, you can return to work. If results are positive, you must test and quarantine for 14 days. You cannot return on campus until all symptoms are gone and fever free for 3 days, without any medication. We are in constant monitoring of the CDC website. Changes to this policy will be updated as the recommendations change from CDC. Occupational Risk for COVID-19 Lower Exposure Risk (Caution) Jobs that do not require contact with people known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2. Workers in this category have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers. Examples include: Remote workers (i.e., those working from home during the pandemic). Office workers who do not have frequent close contact with coworkers, customers, or the public. Manufacturing and industrial facility workers who do not have frequent close contact with coworkers, customers, or the public. Healthcare workers providing only telemedicine services. Long-distance truck drivers. Medium Exposure Risk Jobs that require frequent\/close contact with people who may be infected, but who are not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19. Workers in this category include: Those who may have frequent contact with travelers who return from international locations with widespread COVID-19 transmission. Those who may have contact with the public (e.g., in schools, high population density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings). High Exposure Risk Jobs with a high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of SARS-CoV-2. Workers in this category include: Healthcare delivery and support staff (hospital staff who must enter patients\u2019 rooms) exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients. Medical transport workers (ambulance vehicle operators) moving known or suspected COVID-19 patients in enclosed vehicles. Mortuary workers involved in preparing bodies for burial or cremation of people known to have, or suspected of having, COVID-19 at the time of death. Very High Exposure Risk Jobs with a very high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of SARS-CoV-2 during specific medical, postmortem, or laboratory procedures. Workers in this category include: Healthcare workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, dentists, paramedics, emergency medical technicians) performing aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection) on known or suspected COVID-19 patients. Healthcare or laboratory personnel collecting or handling specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients (e.g., manipulating cultures from known or suspected COVID-19 patients). Morgue workers performing autopsies, which generally involve aerosol-generating procedures, on the bodies of people who are known to have, or are suspected of having, COVID-19 at the time of their death. Use of Masks to Slow the Spread of COVID-19 COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice (e.g., while shouting, chanting, or singing). These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies show that a significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 lack symptoms (are \u201Casymptomatic\u201D) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (are \u201Cpre-symptomatic\u201D) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. To reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings when around people outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Why it is important to wear a mask Masks may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others. Wearing a mask will help protect people around you, including those at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and workers who frequently come into close contact with other people (e.g., in stores and restaurants). Masks are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings. The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced when masks are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. The masks recommended here are not surgical masks or respirators. Currently, those are critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders. Masks are not personal protective equipment (PPE). They are not appropriate substitutes for PPE such as respirators (like N95 respirators) or medical facemasks (like surgical masks) in workplaces where respirators or facemasks are recommended or required to protect the wearer. Wear your Mask Correctly Wash your hands before putting on your mask Put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin Try to fit it snugly against the sides of your face Make sure you can breathe easily CDC does not recommend use of masks or cloth masks for source control if they have an exhalation valve or vent Wear a Mask to Protect Others Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect others in case you\u2019re infected with COVID-19 but don\u2019t have symptoms Wear a mask in public settings when around people who don\u2019t live in your household, especially when it may be difficult for you to stay six feet apart Wear a mask correctly for maximum protection Don\u2019t put the mask around your neck or up on your forehead Don\u2019t touch the mask, and, if you do, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer to disinfect Take Off Your Mask Carefully, When You\u2019re Home Untie the strings behind your head or stretch the ear loops Handle only by the ear loops or ties Fold outside corners together Place mask in the washing machine (learn more about how to wash masks) Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth when removing and wash hands immediately after removing. How COVID-19 Spreads Person-to-person spread The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. The virus spreads easily between people How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious, like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, which means it goes from person-to-person without stopping. The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people. Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious. In general, the more closely a person interacts with others and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. The virus may be spread in other ways It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads. Spread between animals and people At this time, the risk of COVID-19 spreading from animals to people is considered to be low. Learn about COVID-19 and pets and other animals. It appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets worldwide, including cats and dogs, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Learn what you should do if you have pets. Protect yourself and others The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. You can take steps to slow the spread. Maintain good social distance (about 6 feet). This is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others. Learn more about what you can do to protect yourself and others. Social Distancing Keep a Safe Distance to Slow the Spread! What is social distancing? Social distancing, also called \u201Cphysical distancing,\u201D means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household. To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces. Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks, avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Why practice social distancing? COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you\u2014or they\u2014do not have any symptoms. Social distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, it is important to stay home and away from other people until it is safe to be around others. COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sunlight, humidity, and the type of surface. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people outside the home. Although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19. Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community. In addition to practicing everyday steps to prevent COVID-19, keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread in communities. Tips for Social Distancing When going out in public, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from other people and wear a mask to slow the spread of COVID-19. Consider the following tips for practicing social distancing when you decide to go out. Know Before You Go: Before going out, know and follow the guidance from local public health authorities where you live. Prepare for Transportation: Consider social distancing options to travel safely when running errands or commuting to and from work, whether walking, bicycling, wheelchair rolling, or using public transit, rideshares, or taxis. When using public transit, try to keep at least 6 feet from other passengers or transit operators \u2013 for example, when you are waiting at a bus station or selecting seats on a bus or train. When using rideshares or taxis, avoid pooled rides where multiple passengers are picked up, and sit in the back seat in larger vehicles so you can remain at least 6 feet away from the driver. Follow these additional tips to protect yourself while using transportation. Limit Contact When Running Errands: Only visit stores selling household essentials in person when you absolutely need to, and stay at least 6 feet away from others who are not from your household while shopping and in lines. If possible, use drive-thru, curbside pick-up, or delivery services to limit face-to-face contact with others. Maintain physical distance between yourself and delivery service providers during exchanges and wear a mask. Choose Safe Social Activities:It is possible to stay socially connected with friends and family who don\u2019t live in your home by calling, using video chat, or staying connected through social media. If meeting others in person (e.g., at small outdoor gatherings, yard or driveway gathering with a small group of friends or family members), stay at least 6 feet from others who are not from your household. Follow these steps to stay safe if you will be participating in personal and social activities outside of your home. Keep Distance at Events and Gatherings: It is safest to avoid crowded places and gatherings where it may be difficult to stay at least 6 feet away from others who are not from your household. If you are in a crowded space, try to keep 6 feet of space between yourself and others at all times, and wear a mask. Masks are especially important in times when physical distancing is difficult. Pay attention to any physical guides, such as tape markings on floors or signs on walls, directing attendees to remain at least 6 feet apart from each other in lines or at other times. Allow other people 6 feet of space when you pass by them in both indoor and outdoor settings. Stay Distanced While Being Active: Consider going for a walk, bike ride, or wheelchair roll in your neighborhood or in another safe location where you can maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and other pedestrians and cyclists. If you decide to visit a nearby park, trail, or recreational facility, first check for closures or restrictions. If open, consider how many other people might be there and choose a location where it will be possible to keep at least 6 feet of space between yourself and other people who are not from your household. How to Protect Yourself and Others Know how it spreads There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Everyone Should Wash your hands often Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. It\u2019s especially important to wash: Before eating or preparing food Before touching your face After using the restroom After leaving a public place After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After handling your mask After changing a diaper After caring for someone sick After touching animals or pets If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members. Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don\u2019t live in your household. Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from other people. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. The mask is meant to protect other people in case you are infected. Everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don\u2019t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Do NOT use a mask meant for a healthcare worker. Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators are critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders. Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The mask is not a substitute for social distancing. box tissue light icon Cover coughs and sneezes Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit. Throw used tissues in the trash. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them. Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Then, use a household disinfectant. Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants external icon will work. Monitor Your Health Daily Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19. Especially important if you are running essential errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet. Take your temperature if symptoms develop. Don\u2019t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen. Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. What to Do if You Are Sick Steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if you are sick If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, follow the steps below to care for yourself and to help protect other people in your home and community. Stay home except to get medical care Stay home. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas. Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better. Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency. Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis. Separate yourself from other people As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home. If possible, you should use a separate bathroom. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask. Additional guidance is available for those living in close quarters and shared housing. See COVID-19 and Animals if you have questions about pets. Monitor your symptoms Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, or other symptoms. Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and local health department. Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information. When to seek emergency medical attention Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
