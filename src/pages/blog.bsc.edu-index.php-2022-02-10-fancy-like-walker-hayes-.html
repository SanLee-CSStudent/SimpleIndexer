Hayes always channeled the music kid you only see in movies. He would instantly find the piano in the room \u2013 he could play almost anything \u2013 and he would make up songs on the fly. Hayes\u2019 summer track, \u201CFancy Like,\u201D took 2021 by storm, and it\u2019s bringing his favorite low-key date spots with his wife, Laney Beville Hayes \u201901, into the limelight. He saw the track hit No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Country Digital Song Sales chart and spend consecutive weeks on the Hot Country Songs chart. The ode to the Wendy\u2019s Frosty and Applebee\u2019s Bourbon Street Steak has also inspired the viral TikTok dance started by Hayes and his daughter, Lela. Since its release, the song and dance have swept the Internet, leading to Hayes\u2019 appearances on \u201CLate Night with Seth Meyers,\u201D \u201CCBS Sunday Morning,\u201D and \u201CThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201D plus a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song. Hayes also toured throughout the fall and released his single \u201CU Gurl\u201D on Oct. 14. Some alumni \u2013 especially those in the choir with Hayes \u2013 might remember him for his musical moments, or for his goofier moments. Any time the choir got on the bus for a trip or performance, Hayes booked his way to the front, grabbed the microphone, and sang \u201CRappers Delight.\u201D We\u2019ll have to grab a Natty Light sometime soon and hear more of Hayes\u2019 best BSC stories. This story was published in the Fall\/Winter 2021 issue of \u2019Southern, BSC\u2019s alumni magazine. If you have ideas for our next issue of \u2019Southern, please email [email protected] We always welcome stories about outstanding people from the BSC community.
