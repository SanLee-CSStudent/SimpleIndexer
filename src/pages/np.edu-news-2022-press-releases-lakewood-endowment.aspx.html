(formerly known as Lakewood Convalescent Home, Inc.). The gift totaled $445,000 and will be used to endow scholarships for NPC\u2019s nursing programs. Lakewood Healthcare, Inc. operated a nonprofit skilled nursing facility on Lake Park Drive for over 25 years. They sold the facility in 2018 and are now dissolving the nonprofit. The board wanted the funds to be used to serve senior citizens in the Garland County area and believed supporting the nursing workforce was critical to that goal. The board established the endowment in memory of Judge Henry Britt who was the driving force behind the formation of the nonprofit skilled nursing facility with the goal of serving the senior citizens of Garland County. Britt was elected Circuit Judge of Garland County in 1966 and served four terms. He also served as the board\u2019s second chairperson. Britt\u2019s daughter, Nancy Britt was present for the check presentation. She shared the impact nursing had on her family. Her mother, Barbara Holmes Britt served as a nurse\u2019s aide at Chanute Air Force Base during World War II. \u201CThis would mean something to her too,\u201D she noted. \u201COn behalf of the Lakewood Nursing Home board, we are delighted to share this money with the college so that our supply of nurses will continue to flow into the community. We realize the importance of continuing nursing and we hope that they will be directed into caring for the older folks. You do a wonderful job here and we just want to encourage it,\u201D said Lakewood Healthcare board chair, Clyde Covington.
