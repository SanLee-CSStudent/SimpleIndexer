Collective strength of the research enterprise leads to almost $648 million in research grants and awards for FY 2021.In spite of the pandemic and in part because of it, the University of Alabama at Birmingham extended its most successful era of research funding in FY 2021. UAB received nearly $849 million in research grants and extramural awards for the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2021, up from almost $638 million the previous year, according to data from its Office of Sponsored Programs. The additional $211 million, which represents an extraordinary one-year increase of 33%, includes two pandemic-related awards totaling $201 million. \u201CThis is nothing short of amazing,\u201D said Christopher Brown, vice president for Research, acknowledging UAB\u2019s research enterprise was not immune to the effects of limited business operations at the onset of the pandemic. \u201CIt speaks to the strength of the UAB research enterprise, and that includes the faculty, postdocs and students, plus our facilities and our administrators who work with them. It also speaks to our leadership, particularly President Watts, who pushes everyone to excel.\u201D \u201CThe past two years have shown that nothing \u2014 not even a global pandemic \u2014 can dampen our innovative spirit or weaken our drive to serve and succeed,\u201D UAB President Ray Watts said. \u201CWe are emerging even stronger because of these challenges, and I am confident that will enable us to continue to raise the ceiling for our success.\u201D Brown, who said, \u201CWith respect to our research enterprise, the effects of the pandemic were immediate and real-time but not lingering,\u201D now describes it as \u201Chumming along in all quarters.\u201D He points to two particular items as proof: During this period, each of the six health-related schools is among the top 10 public universities receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health, and UAB ranks among the top 3% of U.S. universities based on all federal research funding awarded. Industry support from all sources totaled $149 million, up 49% for the year, and industry-supported clinical trials, a subset of this number, increased $42 million or 56% for the year. Brown notes that, even if extraordinary awards from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are excluded from the year-end total, UAB research funding still exceeded $648 million in 2021 \u2014 a $10 million year-to-year boost that extends the five-year rate of increase to 43%.

One for $59 million is from the federal Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds, distributed to most universities and used to support employees and students affected by the pandemic. The second is a $147 million grant that originated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and came to the UAB School of Public Health through the Alabama Department of Public Health. It is currently being used to conduct COVID-19 testing in the state\u2019s K-12 schools. While this COVID-19 testing program is not a research project, as a research institution, the work from this program will be published related to evaluation of programs, particularly around public health endeavors, and this project would fall under the same umbrella. This would be done with approval from all parties involved, but would only be aggregate data. \u201CBecause of our demonstrated competence in this area, we were well-positioned to partner with the Department of Public Health to provide these safeguards for children and adults in our state\u2019s elementary and secondary schools.\u201D Brown is optimistic that growth will continue in the coming year. Even when lab work was interrupted, faculty continued to write and submit grants and publish results of previous research, Brown says. Overall proposal submissions are at a record high this year at 5,767, which represents a 2.8% increase over the past year, and the number of awards remained steady at 4,467. \u201CWe are going to see the full benefits of that over the coming year as submitted proposals become funded grants,\u201D Brown said. He also pointed to other strategies that will boost UAB\u2019s success next year and beyond. The past two years have shown that nothing \u2014 not even a global pandemic \u2014 can dampen our innovative spirit or weaken our drive to serve and succeed. We are emerging even stronger because of these challenges, and I am confident that will enable us to continue to raise the ceiling for our success. \u2014 UAB President Ray Watts \u201CSchools are focused on attracting and recruiting faculty who bring ideas and research with them,\u201D he said. UAB\u2019s leadership in biomedical-related research is certainly a strength, and Brown also is excited about growing strengths, including materials and biomaterials engineering, autonomous vehicles, data visualization, and resiliency. Another attractive element is UAB\u2019s Harbert Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which \u201Cfosters and nurtures the entrepreneurial ecosystem here through tech-transfer and more,\u201D Brown said. \u201CIt helps translate research into an economic benefit by shepherding patents, licensing, spin-offs and startups that, in turn, benefit our research enterprise because those attract and benefit faculty.\u201D In FY 2021, intellectual property disclosures managed by HIIE increased 50% to 127, plus 19 patents were issued, 44 licenses were executed, three startups were launched, and $4.87 million in revenue was generated. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
