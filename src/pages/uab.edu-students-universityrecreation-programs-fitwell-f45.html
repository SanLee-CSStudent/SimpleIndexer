Policies Late Policy Our weekday F45 classes are 45 minutes long from start to finish. We recommend you arrive to the F45 Studio at least five minutes early as our classes begin promptly at their scheduled time. Due to the format of F45 Training, you will not be permitted to enter the studio once the class begins. Arriving late is a distraction to your F45 teammates and may result in injury. Thank you for understanding. Cancellation Policy If you no longer plan to attend a class, you must cancel at least 24 hours in advance. Participants who do not cancel their class registration 24 hours in advance will be charged a pass.
