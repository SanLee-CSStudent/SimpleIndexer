Student Spotlight: Sarah Winters, '18 Winters believes that Lyon\u2019s liberal arts curriculum is helpful for elementary school teachers, who teach every subject to their pupils. \u201CThey\u2019re going to ask you questions about science, about math, about social studies, and that\u2019s all your responsibility,\u201D says Winters, \u201Cso when I have a wealth of knowledge that I\u2019ve gotten from Lyon that applies in the multiple areas that I\u2019m teaching them, it really helps me feel more comfortable and prepared in the classroom, which in turn makes the students more comfortable as well.\u201D Read more about her experience and the program here!
