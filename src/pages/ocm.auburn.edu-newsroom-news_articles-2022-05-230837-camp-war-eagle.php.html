The two-day camp is designed as an introduction to Auburn\u2019s campus for first-year students who will be starting classes this fall. Approximately 4,800 students and 6,000 accompanying parents are expected to participate in Camp War Eagle\u2019s 11 on-campus sessions\u2014the first of which is set to kick off on Wednesday, May 25. On-campus sessions will last through July 14, and a schedule of all camp dates can be found online. Virtual sessions also are being offered, with approximately 300 students choosing that option. \u201COverall numbers of participants are similar to last year, but the sessions are again different,\u201D said Mark Armstrong, who oversees Camp War Eagle and is Auburn\u2019s executive director of Academic Partnerships. Armstrong said that unlike one year ago, when Camp War Eagle was structured to offer one-day, on-campus sessions as well as some virtual sessions and virtual advising meetings, this year\u2019s sessions will be two days and will involve an overnight stay\u2014signaling more of a return to standard operations prior to COVID-19. In 2020, Camp War Eagle was offered 100% virtual amid the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic. \u201CThis year, students will experience orientation and advising in person, unless they choose to attend a virtual session. As has been the case the last two years, all students will still register for fall classes virtually,\u201D Armstrong said, adding that \u201Clast year, we had a restriction of one parent\/family member with each student at our on-campus sessions. That has been lifted, too, and we are seeing a return of heavy parent\/family involvement at Camp War Eagle.\u201D Armstrong said six students will be working as head counselors as part of the camp and 53 students will serve as camp counselors, working with both students and families. Armstrong said many different departments will be represented at Camp War Eagle by way of information sessions, tabling opportunities and panel presentations.
