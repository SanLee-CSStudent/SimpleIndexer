Year-round Pell allows students to receive up to 150 percent of a regular grant award over the course of the academic year so that they can continue taking classes in the summer and finish their degrees faster than they would otherwise. Note: The provisions of the new law state that any Pell Grant received will be included in determining the student\u2019s Pell Grant duration of eligibility and Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU). To be eligible for additional Pell Grant funds: Student must be otherwise eligible to receive Pell Grant funds for the payment period Student must be enrolled at least half-time in the payment period(s) (6 credit hours) during the summer term Student must be maintaining satisfactory academic progress Title IV Code: 001013 Financial Aid Staff Helpful Links Consumer Information Federal Aid Application or Renewal Application (FAFSA) FastWeb!
