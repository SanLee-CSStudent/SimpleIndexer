TERRORISM PREPAREDNESS We have all been hearing about the potential for a terrorist attack in the United States. While there have been no specific threats against Tuskegee University, we need to be aware of steps we can take to prevent an attack or to respond to an attack that does take place. Click here for Active Shooter Information Following are guidelines for preparing for a terrorist attack: 1) BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS !!! Report any suspicious person immediately to the Tuskegee University Police Department at either 334-727-8757 or 334-727-8756. Report unattended backpacks or bags, suspicious packages, spills or smells immediately to the Tuskegee University Police Department at 334-727- 8757 or 334-727-8756. Keep building doors and windows locked when the building is closed. Report any buildings that are not secured to the Tuskegee University Police Department at 334-727-8757 or 334-727-8756. 2) BE PREPARED If an explosion occurs, if you notice an apparent chemical spill of unknown origin, if you smell a suspicious odor, or if people near you become suddenly sick, call the Tuskegee University Police Department immediately at campus ext. 4911 or 334-724-4911 or 334-727-8757 or 334-727-8756. The campus community will be notified by Tiger Alert mass e-mail, text and voicemail if a terrorist attack occurs. If you are notified that a terrorist attack has taken place, go indoors, close windows and doors, and remain inside until told it is safe to leave. Do not exit a building to go to your vehicle and leave campus. Do not call family or friends to come to campus to pick you up. You could be exposing yourself or your family and friends to toxic gases or other materials. Contact one family member to report that you are safe, and make the call short as the campus telephone lines will need to remain free for emergency communications. Tell your family that Tuskegee University\u2019s Emergency Plan is to shelter everyone on campus, and make a family emergency plan. If necessary, make a plan for backup care of children or other family members needing assistance if you must remain on campus. If you are at home and hear that there has been a terrorist attack on the Tuskegee University campus, do not come to campus until the University announces that it is safe to do so. TigerAlert will notify you of any incidents via mass e-mail, text and voicemail. The Tuskegee University Police Department , in conjunction with the University Safety Officer will call the appropriate law enforcement, fire, or health agency to respond, assess the situation, and provide advice on when it is safe to resume normal activities, whether areas need to be roped off or quarantined, etc. Macon County warning sirens (long constant beep) will be activated as circumstances warrant. All University managers in housing, communications, food service, physical plant and the police department are required to be on call 24 hours during an emergency.
