You will also be in the unique position to help students bridge the gap between elementary and high school; facilitating their transition from early childhood into adolescence. Incredible Job Security and Opportunities for Advancement While the licensure requirements vary from state to state, teachers who have established a good work ethic and reputation don\u2019t have to worry too much about finding a job.

Opportunities to Work During Internship Undergraduate students in traditional licensure programs may earn income working in K-12 schools during their internships through the following opportunities. Any student enrolled in a School of Education program who would like to complete their internship as a paraprofessional or substitute teacher must first have the approval of their Program Coordinator, the Director of Teacher Licensure and Placement, and the Director of the School of Education. Paraprofessional Position Interns may apply for open paraprofessional positions in any K-12 school in the state. Students must meet the hiring school\u2019s requirements for a paraprofessional, which often can include holding an associate\u2019s degree or completing 60 hours of undergraduate course work. Some schools may ask their paraprofessionals to complete the ParaPro Assessment as well. Interns enrolled in the Elementary Education and Middle Childhood Education programs must work as instructional or academic paraprofessionals in classrooms that meet the requirements of the internships in which they are enrolled each semester. For these programs, a paraprofessional position in a Special Education classroom will not meet program and licensure requirements. Interns enrolled in the Special Education program may only work as Special Education paraprofessionals under the supervision of licensed special educators. Their paraprofessional positions must meet the grade level and disability level of the internships in which they are enrolled each semester. While it is unlikely that students enrolled in the Education Minor program will be able to find instructional or academic paraprofessional positions in their content area and at their grade level, they may also work as paraprofessionals during internship if the position matches the requirements of the internship course. Substitute Position Please contact Heather Newsam for the most up-to-date information given the recent changes at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education continue.
