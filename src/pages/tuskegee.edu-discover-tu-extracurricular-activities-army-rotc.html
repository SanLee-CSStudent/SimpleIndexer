Army ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) is one of the best leadership courses in the country and is part of the university curriculum. During classes, leadership labs, physical training and field training exercises, you will learn first-hand what it takes to lead others, motivate groups and conduct missions as an officer in the Army. Upon graduation from Army ROTC, you will earn the gold bar of a Second Lieutenant and be commissioned into the Active Army, Army Reserve or Army National Guard and become a leader for life. There are several ways to join the Army ROTC Program here at Tuskegee University. If you are in high school and are interested in being an ROTC cadet, please contact the recruiting team at (334) 715-1477. If you are already a college student here at Tuskegee University, you can begin by taking the Military Science 101 class as an elective on your curriculum; it can be taken in lieu of physical education. Make an appointment to see our recruiters to discuss scholarships that may be available to you, including opportunities to compete for two-, three-, or four-year scholarships. Overall, the Army ROTC program here at Tuskegee will continue to commission great officers and help them develop leadership skills to be successful before becoming a Second Lieutenant in the US Army. \"The order, the self-discipline, the pride that had been instilled in me by ROTC was a tremendous companion to my basic liberal arts education and prepared me well for my Army career, or for that matter, any career I might have chosen.\" \"Challenge young people by having high expectations of them; engage them with the opportunity to realize those expectations through constructive, character-building activities.\" -- Retired General Colin Powell ABOUT MILITARY SCIENCE The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program at Tuskegee University has a rich and unique history. The TU ROTC program began in 1918, just after World War I, and has continued to produce Army officers since that time. It is a prestigious program that vaunts pioneers of African-American military service. Among its first Professors of Military Science are Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., the first African-American General Officer in the military, and Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., commander of the Tuskegee Airmen and first African-American General Officer in the Air Force. As befits its trail-blazing tradition, Tuskegee University ROTC has also produced six African-American General Officers for the Army. Today, cadets of the Golden Tiger Battalion continue to enhance this legacy of pride and accomplishment. A key benefit of Army ROTC is that it provides a great opportunity for young people to develop the skills for success that are applicable to all aspects of life. Cadets are first of all students and our primary goal is to support them as they strive to achieve graduation. Therefore, not only do we teach military skills, we help them to gain confidence and respect for themselves. Additionally, we promote values such as loyalty, duty, respect, service, honor, integrity and courage as personal characteristics. Statistics show that this support matters, because students who enroll in ROTC tend to do better in college and graduate at a higher rate than do those who are not enrolled. Certainly, we look for bright, talented high school and college students, as well as enlisted members of the armed forces who are interested in becoming Army officers; but ROTC is open to everyone for participation. However, only students who enroll as cadets are eligible to take advantage of all the training and scholarship opportunities. Among these opportunities are a number of full 4, 3, and 2-year scholarships that provide for tuition, books, room and board, and a monthly stipend of $420. Altogether, Army ROTC at Tuskegee University is a great experience that offers valuable opportunities to build for the future by earning a college degree and a commission as an officer in the U.S. Army, Army National Guard or Army Reserves.
