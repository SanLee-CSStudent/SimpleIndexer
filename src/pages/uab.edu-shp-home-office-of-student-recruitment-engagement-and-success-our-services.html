HRP 101: Experiencing the University Transition All freshmen declaring a pre-health major - that is any School of Health Professions undergraduate program or pre-SHP with undeclared major - are required to complete a first year experience course during their first fall term. We offer HRP 101 to ease your transition between high school and university experiences and to prepare you for success in health professions majors. The course is three semester hours credit, and is designed to be delivered in a seminar format. Students interact with faculty, advisors, and other students to learn academic skills and personal lifestyle management tactics to make their freshman experience positive and academically rewarding.
