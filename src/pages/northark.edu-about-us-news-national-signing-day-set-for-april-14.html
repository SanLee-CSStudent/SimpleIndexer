The local ceremony will be held in the John Paul Hammerschmidt Conference Center on the south campus of Northark from 1:30 \u2013 2:30 p.m. Parents, grandparents, educators, administrators, industry partners and the public are invited to attend to celebrate the student\u2019s commitment to pursue a technical career pathway at Northark. Signing Day mirrors the NCAA\u2019s National Signing Day for athletes who commit to play sports in college, but instead of athletes, NC3\u2019s Signing Day is designed to honor students who are entering a technical field and to celebrate the dignity of work. The 2020 NSD event was cancelled and the 2021 ceremony was held virtually. \u201CWe\u2019re glad to once again hold this in-person on campus. It\u2019s a highlight of the year,\u201D noted President Dr. Rick Massengale. \u201CBy signing incoming students and recognizing their commitment, we\u2019re telling them they have a place in the Northark family and the technical education they receive at Northark will prepare them for a strong career.\u201D Together with NC3\u2019s national industry partners, local area business and community leaders along with schools\u2019 own corporate partners participate in Signing Day both to show support and to provide information to students and their families. Students and family members are afforded opportunities to interact with potential future employers and learn more about high-demand jobs available in the area.
