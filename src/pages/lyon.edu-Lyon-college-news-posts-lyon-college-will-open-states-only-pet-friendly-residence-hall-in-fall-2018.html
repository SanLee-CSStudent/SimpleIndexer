Through this new initiative, Lyon joins just a small handful of colleges in the country that allow cats and dogs in on-campus housing. Recently, several changes have been made to the College\u2019s programming to create a more inclusive, holistic approach to campus life. According to President W. Joseph King, \u201CWe will be the only pet-friendly college from Texas to Virginia. It is exciting to move Lyon in a more pet-friendly direction. Like many of our students, my family has had beloved dogs and cats. We know how much they are a part of your life. Therefore, this change seemed like a progressive step for student life at the college. Initial reaction from current and prospective students has been very positive.\u201D \u201CLyon is always looking for innovative ways to create a better residential community,\u201D says Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students Patrick Mulick. \u201CThis specific living community came about through listening to our students and closely examining the empirical literature on the benefits of pets. Both suggest that the students in the pet-friendly residence hall will cope better with stress and be more productive than if they did not have their pets living with them.\u201D One of Lyon\u2019s residence halls will be designated as pet-friendly, opening up spots for 20 students to bring their four-legged companions to live with them at school. The College will consider opening up more residence halls to pets as demand grows. To accommodate its new furry occupants, Lyon will offer pet obedience courses throughout the school year. The College will also offer a pet blessing each October, when College Chaplain Maggie Alsup will help students celebrate God\u2019s love, care and concern for all creation. This celebration usually takes place around the Feast Day of St. Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals. Alsup says, \u201CIt is a time to recognize our mutual interdependence with God's creatures and to give thanks for the relationships we have with them.\u201D The College will welcome pets to areas all over campus. The College\u2019s new coffee shop and study area, The Salty Dog, will have treats for both pets and students. A fenced-in dog park is being added on campus to give dogs leash-free time outside. \u201CStudents expect more today,\u201D said Eric Bork, Associate Vice President of Marketing and Communications. \u201CFor many students, their pet is their closest companion. If they want to share their college experience with their best friend, of course we want to help make that possible.\u201D Interested families may visit http:\/\/www.lyon.edu\/petlife for more information or contact kimberly.hindsbrush@lyon.edu with any questions. **please direct any media requests to marketing@lyon.edu or 870-307-7242** ?
