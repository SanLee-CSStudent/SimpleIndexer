Students that are under academic suspension or dismissal from their home institution will not be admitted to Calhoun Community College as a transient student. Transient students must request and ensure that the Registrar of their home college or university send a letter of transience (aka \u201CLetter of Good Standing\u201D) directly to the Calhoun Community College Admission\u2019s Office. The letter must indicate that the course(s) to be taken at Calhoun will be acceptable at that institution. Letters of transience must be on file prior to the student\u2019s registration for courses. Transient students cannot receive financial aid at both institutions, only their home school for which they are degree seeking is responsible for processing their financial aid. Transient students should plan to contact their institution\u2019s FA office several weeks prior to the start date of Calhoun\u2019s semester they intend to register for. Transient students will be expected to pay their tuition, fees, and books by the payment deadline. There are no exceptions to this rule. A transient student\u2019s home institution will issue their financial aid refunds at their regularly scheduled time. Applicants who attended high school, college or received a GED outside the state of Alabama may be assessed out-of-state tuition. Once the transient student completes the term, they must submit an on-line transcript request to have their transcript sent to the Registrar\u2019s Office of their home school. NOTE: Transient students are exempt from Placement Tests. Transient students are not required to submit high school or college transcripts since the transient approval letter will serve in lieu of transcripts.

In order for Calhoun Community College student\u2019s to receive permission to take courses at another institution, they must: Have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA and be in good standing. Not be a first semester student. Not have any registration or financial holds. Not have previously completed the requested course with a grade of \u201CC\u201D or better. Not be on a third attempt or more for the requested course. Not exceed the maximum allowed credit hours for the term of attendance. Not be currently enrolled in the requested course(s) at Calhoun. Meet the Calhoun pre-requisite(s) for the requested course(s). Be currently enrolled in a degree or certificate program. Have requirements remaining towards a degree or certificate program. 2. Transient students must receive approval from their academic advisor and the Registrar\u2019s Office before taking a course at any other institution. 3. Credit will only be accepted from regionally accredited institutions where there are reasonable course equivalencies. It is the responsibility of the student to determine the accreditation status of any institution where they intend to take courses as a transient student. 4. When applying for transiency, students may need to provide the Registrar\u2019s Office with a course description for each transient course requested. 5. Federal regulations prohibit students from receiving aid from more than one institution during the same academic term. Therefore, all requests for financial aid during terms of transient study must be filed with Calhoun, not the host institution and initiated several weeks before the semester start date. 6. All tuition, fees and books\/supplies owed to the host institution are to be paid directly to that institution by the student by the host school\u2019s deadline. If applicable, potential reimbursement via financial aid would follow. 7. Transient coursework must transfer back to Calhoun and apply toward the degree-program the student is enrolled in. 8. Students who attempt transient courses at a host institution must provide an official transcript with final grades from the host institution upon completion of the transient courses.
