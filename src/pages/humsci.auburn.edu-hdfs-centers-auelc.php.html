Children attend from 8:30-11:30 or from 12:30-3:30. Children in the three and four-year-old classes may attend both morning and afternoon sessions. Children must be the age of the class by September 2nd in order to enroll. Three and four year olds must be toilet trained. Child care is not provided during the lunch break for dually enrolled children. Parents must provide care and a lunch. In previous years parents have arranged a group child care experience during the lunch hour to alleviate the strain on parents who can\u2019t come at that time. No guarantees are in place that this will happen each year. Head teachers generally hold advanced degrees in Early Childhood Education or Child Development and the teaching assistants are graduate students working on advanced degrees in Human Development and Family Science or another related field of study. The teaching philosophy of the facility is grounded in the concept of developmentally appropriate practice in which children \"learn by doing\" and are guided by a curriculum designed to capitalize upon knowledge of how young children learn. The facility also maintains a research mission and is designed to maximize opportunities to conduct developmental research on children and their families.
