Read more about IT ABC's of Zoom & Microsoft Teams Campus WiFi Do's and Don'ts Current OIT Campus Projects Zoom is a leader in the video communications industry, tackling unified communications with their cloud platform for video, audio conferencing, collaboration, chat, and webinars across all endpoints. Microsoft Teams is Microsoft\u2019s all-encompassing workstream collaboration plus unified communications platform \u2013 combining meetings, chats, calls, and file sharing with the Office 365 application stack to bring everyone together in a shared workspace. When it comes to features, both Zoom and Teams enable online meetings, chats, calls, screen sharing, and file sharing. READ MORE Microsoft Teams vs Zoom At a very high-level, Microsoft Teams and Zoom both overlap and compete in the way that they offer a set of services for video conferencing, and UC telephony. Drilling deeper into the more nuanced features, UX, pricing, and integrations is how organizations can evaluate trade-offs and make the best decisions as to which platform is the effective fit. Features of Microsoft Teams and Zoom When it comes to features, both Zoom and Teams enable online meetings, chats, calls, screen sharing, and file sharing. The difference between the two is really Microsoft\u2019s integration between Teams and its Office 365 stack. This enables Microsoft Teams to truly be a one-stop-shop for many organizations. This also allows for seamless collaboration, backups, and file search. However, going some way to balance out Microsoft\u2019s Office365 integration, Zoom features a wide-ranging partnership and set of technical integrations. Zoom, as a company, is a much newer organization in comparison to the behemoth that is Microsoft, yet it manages to compete with its aggressive roadmap, and due to the fact that it doesn\u2019t have to worry about managing (and eventually migrating) a set of legacy on-premises customers. UX (User Interface) The user interface and experience are truly where Zoom excels in the Microsoft Teams vs Zoom debate. Zoom users all rave over its simple interface and the ability to get end-users up and running with little to no training or IT support. Microsoft Teams poses a bigger challenge as users need to get up to speed on how to interact in different channels. Teams incorporates file sharing and all of the other Office 365 applications baked into Teams. Although the full workstream collaboration functionality built into Teams clearly allows it to offer a broader surface area of usage and scenarios than Zoom, this precise value is also in some ways its Achilles heel with respect to onboarding. Source: www.unifysquare.com Both students and faculty need high-performing, reliable access for learning, and personal use---no matter how crowded the area is. In order to do this, campus wireless networks need to deploy the necessary infrastructure. Capable, reliable WiFi is needed in order to deliver the performance that users expect inside areas such as: academic classrooms administrative buildings cafeteria dorms lecture halls student center READ MORE Therefore, a capable WiFi standard is needed to properly support the growing use of mobile devices throughout campus. DO: Learn how to connect and dis-connect from campus WiFi Learn basic troubleshooting of WiFi issues Register your wireless devices with OIT so you can connect them to the school network Check email messages for planned power outages DON'T: Don't open emails from unknown sources. The firewall doesn't protect everything. A lot of SCAM emails end up in your inbox. Especially textbook scams, fake internship opportunities, or get-rich-quick scams. Don't respond to those emails. Whenever possible, connect your desktop computer or laptop to wired internet. You'll find it is faster. Is it safe to use campus WiFi? Public networks are unsecured, meaning your devices are vulnerable to a malware attack. This could leave you with damaged operating systems or open you up to data theft. However, if you take the right precautions and use the right tools, it's easy to stay safe and search the internet using campus Wi-Fi. Some benefits of WiFi: Give students a broader range of learning styles Creates a real-life environment Helps students develop teamwork skills Makes classwork easily accessible Helps students learn faster Tuskegee University Office of Information Technology (OIT) is embarking on an Information Technology infrastructure upgrade this Spring and Summer. The project includes upgrading the Campus Technology Infrastructure, which will include replacement of network switches and routers in the Data Center, administrative buildings, and student residential buildings. The upgrades are expected to improve the availability of Tuskegee networks and computing platforms. We will create a project status site to keep you updated on the status of our progress and wiil have more details to follow.
