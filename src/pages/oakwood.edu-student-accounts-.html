Late Registration Fee is $193 per semester Credit Balance Refunds Students who have a credit balance on their account may be eligible to receive a refund. The type of credit on a student\u2019s account will determine the method of initiating the refund and the length of time for a student to receive their refund. If the credit balance is a result of Federal Student Aid a refund will be issued within 14 days of disbursement. In an effort to meet University sustainability goals and increase efficiency, The Office of Student Accounts has transitioned its refund policy to Direct Deposit only. This refund delivery method will be effective immediately. Failure to sign up for direct deposit will further delay the receipt of your funds. A student may completely withdraw from Oakwood University with appropriate documentation from the Registrar\u2019s Office. Unofficial withdrawal results in 100 percent forfeiture of tuition. When officially withdrawing, the student may be eligible for a refund of tuition depending upon the date of withdrawal. Refunds are only processed for complete withdrawal. Financial aid awards that pay part or all of the student charges are prorated accordingly. Refunds for federal (Title IV) aid recipients will be prorated in accordance with federal regulations. No refunds are issued until all semester charges are paid in full. The Oakwood Tuition Adjustment schedule for 2019-2020 School year: IMPORTANT DATES REMINDERS FALL 2019 SPRING 2020 Refund for Tuition (100%) August 23 January 17 Refund for Tuition (90%) August 30 January 24 Refund for Tuition (75%) September 6 January 31 Refund for Tuition (50%) September 13 February 7 Students are required to enter bank account information for which they are designated as the primary account holder. Students are responsible for updating their bank account information. ACH direct deposit excludes payroll, federal college work study earnings and fellowships. Once enrolled in ACH direct deposit, students will continue to receive all refunds via ACH direct deposit up until 6 months after they graduate, withdraw or until a student deletes their bank account information on-line. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to verify that all ACH direct deposit payments have been credited to their bank account before writing checks against their funds. Students cannot have their refund split between ACH direct deposit and a paper check. Credit balances that are a result of a Parent Plus Loan can only be directly deposited into a students\u2019 bank account if a Parent Plus Authorization Form has been signed and submitted, by the borrowing parent, to the Office of Student Accounts. Oakwood University reserves the right to initiate credit entries and to initiate, if necessary, debit entries and adjustments for any credit entries in error to a student\u2019s account. ACH direct deposits can be transmitted to U.S. bank accounts only. Students can only have one bank account on file with the University at a time. Any changes made by the student to their bank account information will overwrite the previous information entered. A Title IV Parent Plus Loan credit exists when the total amount of Parent Plus Loan disbursed for the term exceeds the total amount of tuition and fees. If a Parent Plus Loan credit exists on the student\u2019s account and the borrowing parent wants the refund to go directly to the student, then the borrowing parent must complete and submit a Parent Plus Authorization Form along with a copy of a photo ID. All Parent Plus Authorization forms should be faxed to (202) 885-1139. A Title IV credit exists when the total amount of Title IV funds disbursed for the term exceeds the total amount of tuition, room & board, and fees. Below is a list of Title IV Funds: Federal Pell Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Federal Direct Loan (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) Federal Direct PLUS Loan Federal Teach Grant (TEACH) If a Title IV credit exists on a student\u2019s account then a refund will automatically be refunded to the student. A Non-Title IV credit balance exists, after applying all TItle IV funds and external funds against the terms tuition charges. If the Non-Title IV disbursed funds exceed the remaining unpaid tuition and charges, a refund may be issued. Examples of Non-Title IV Funds are scholarships (external), grants, remitted tuition, etc. Institutional funds are non-refundable.
