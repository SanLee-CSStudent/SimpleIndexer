Off-campus work authorization is not allowed for the first 9 months of holding F-1 status. Off-campus employment options should be discussed with ISSS. What do I need to do to obtain a Form I-20 or Form DS-2019? You must be fully admitted into a degree-seeking program (i.e., bachelor, master, doctorate, etc.) in order to be issued an I-20 or DS-2019 form. In addition, you must provide proof of funding for one academic year by providing an affidavit of support from your sponsor and an original bank statement. Students receiving funding from their home country government, some international organizations, or the United States government may be required to obtain an DS-2019. What if I want to stay at UAB for a second degree? If you are completing a lower degree and wish to pursue a higher-level degree within UAB, you must apply to and be admitted into the higher-level degree program. You must obtain proof of funding through your department or by providing an affidavit of support and original bank statement in order to receive a new I-20 or DS-2019. If you are transferring to UAB from another school and changing levels, then you will need to do all of the previously mentioned steps and also providing a transfer clearance form from your previous university. What documents do I need if I travel to my home country or a third country for a brief visit? Whether you are in F-1 or J-1 status, you must obtain a travel letter and must have a current I-20 or DS-2019 with a signature of less than one year old. Please complete a Student Request Form to obtain a travel letter from ISSS at least 2 weeks prior to your departure. Additionally recommended documentation: transcripts, proof of funding (if available), proof of current registration, student ID, and any other proof that you are a current student. What do I need to do if I am graduating? Students in F-1 status have up to 60 days after graduation to do one of the following: 1) apply for and be admitted into a new degree program (must occur before 60 days); 2) Apply for post-completion optional practical training (OPT); 3) depart the US; or 4) change to another visa status. Students in J-1 status have only 30 days after graduation to do one of the following: 1) apply for and be admitted into a higher degree level; 2) apply for J-1 academic training; or 3) depart the US.

F-2 dependents cannot enroll in a degree-seeking program, but can enroll in avocational and recreational courses such as improving English, hobby classes, and\/or exercise. F-2 dependents cannot receive any kind of financial compensation. An F-2 who wishes to attend school full-time should apply for change to F-1 status. H-4 and J-2 dependents can be part-time or full-time students. Can my spouse or child (F-2, J-2, or H-4 \u201Cdependents\u201D) be employed in the US? F-2 dependents cannot be employed.
