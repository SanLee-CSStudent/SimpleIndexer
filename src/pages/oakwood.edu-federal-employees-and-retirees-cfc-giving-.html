Program Give UNCF Golf Select Page Federal Employees and Retirees: CFC Giving This year for the Combined Federal Campaign, Oakwood has been endeavoring to serve the Huntsville community in more tangible ways. The school wants to serve in the same way that Jesus did; meeting the needs of the people and then sharing the Good News of Jesus\u2019 sacrifice and the perfect life to come. Oakwood is located in North Alabama. North Alabama is a food and job insecure environment for those with limited work skills. Oakwood is located in an area that is considered a food dessert and also has poor access to healthcare. To support this underserved community Oakwood has developed the following services: The Community Health Action Center (CHAC) \u2013 The CHAC is a community center that houses a primary care center with the intention to provide health and education services to the Huntsville community. The center houses a primary care office in an area where primary care is scarce. It has a child development lab, a teaching kitchen and a community space to provide health education, job skills education, job referral services, and access to a food pantry. The Mobile Market: The mobile market delivers food to 6 local food desserts in the Huntsville Area. It provides fresh fruits and vegetables to underserved communities nearby. Transportation can make food deserts even more detrimental to a community. By making the market mobile, it will further helps those in need! Literacy Factory: A 10-week program for children that has been proven to increase their reading skills by at least two grade levels. Please consider supporting these causes by donating to Oakwood University through the Combined Federal Campaign. To contribute, visit https:\/\/givecfc.org, CFC Code: 96964.
