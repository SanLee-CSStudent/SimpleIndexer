President\u2019s Report: Dr. Esters thanked the trustees who attended convocation and discussed the coffee bar to welcome students back for Spring Semester. He invited everyone to go look at the newly painted halls. He gave an update on the completion of the Learning Resource Center. The College expects to have the LRC project completed by February 1st.

Approval of Consent Agenda: Chair Lovell requested a motion to approve the Consent Agenda. The Consent Agenda included the December Regular Meeting Minutes, Certification of Solvency, Restructured Position-Director of Student Success, Curriculum Changes Notification, and Office Facility Lease Revision. Chair Lovell asked Don Sugg if he had anything to add and Don explained the new terms of the lease agreement. Don reminded the trustees that at the December 2018 meeting a facility lease with the Caroline Frances Myers Revocable Trust for 7,185 square feet of office space at 218 & 220 East Ridge Avenue, Harrison, Arkansas was approved. The tentative terms presented then included a 24 month lease with an annual cost of $58,896 ($8.20 per annual square foot). After further vigorous negotiations between the Lessor, the Arkansas Division of Building Authority and Northark administration, the new tentative lease provisions call for a term starting January 15, 2019 and ending June 30, 2021 (29.5 months to coincide with the college\u2019s fiscal year and to allow more time for permanent facility planning and development) and a new annual rate of $59,994.76 ($8.35 per annual square foot). Trustee Miller made a motion to approve the Consent Agenda as presented, which was seconded by Trustee Evans and passed unanimously. Monitoring Reports: Sarah Bing reported on gateway course completion with last year ending at 89.6%, well above the Northark average of 53.7%. Concurrent students are doing very well. Course success is at 80%, which is on target. Credential attainment has grown from 47%-55% and the college is on the right track to hit the 60% goal. Concurrent credit enrollment last year went from 181 to 183, with fall enrollment at 209. This was due to a 6 credit hour cap being removed in 2017. The first student to graduate with their AA from concurrent classes will be graduating this spring. She mentioned that Huntsville High School will offer English Comp 1 & 2 beginning in Fall 2019. The online concurrent form piloted for spring 2019 will replace current paper form. She discussed participation in parent\/teacher conference night at Harrison High School, providing information on classes and recruitment to the College. We are currently going through a re-accreditation process through the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP), and will know if we have been re-accredited by May 2019.
