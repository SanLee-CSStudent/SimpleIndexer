DCB stands for declining cash balance. This is tax-free money tied to a meal plan and is used just like cash at any of the Chartwells locations. Left over DCB dollars will carry over from the Fall Semester to the Spring, however, the student must purchase a Spring meal plan for this to happen. DCB can be used between semester breaks and additional amounts can be purchased if needed. If you have special dietary needs - Through Chartwells' award winning Balanced U program and their trained and dedicated staff, we are confident that each student, regardless of dietary needs, will find available food options that are healthy and satisfying at Chamber's Dining Hall. If you would like to discuss specific dietary accommodations, you can contact our Dining Services Management team at 479-498-6033.
