As a student in the College of Arts and Sciences, you will be assigned an academic advisor based on your choice of major. If you have not yet decided on a major, or are completing the necessary requirements for entrance into a professional program, you will be assigned an advisor to help you meet your goals. We're Here to Answer Your Questions While you have the ultimate responsibility for your academic success, your advisor will help you develop your educational plans, set goals, and choose the appropriate courses so you can graduate on time and be prepared for your next step. Your advisor can also refer you to support services on campus such as counseling, tutoring, and study skills workshops. When are we open? Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., in Heritage Hall Building 522. Some advisors are located in other offices. Please check your advisor's page for contact information. How can we help?
