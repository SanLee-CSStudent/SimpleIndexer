What is your vision for UAB in 2021? In which areas should UAB focus its investments? In the past six weeks, approximately 546 faculty, students and staff participated in our in-person Town Halls and Listening Sessions, and we received a total of 205 comments via our web-based feedback form. In keeping with our commitment to anonymity and confidentiality, we have aggregated the data collected and have only indicated respondents' affiliations, if given. Comments noted at the Town Halls and Listening Sessions are listed as such. Answers to questions are in the sections below. Question 1: What are your current impressions of UAB? Answer Affiliation A great place that had supported my career development and achievement. I always felt that it is a very supportive place. Online: Faculty An academic medical institution that has been is a slow decline from 2004 to present due to the loss of signature senior faculty and the inability to recruit high-impact replacements either through an inability or unwillingness to make the finances available. Online: Faculty At the verge of a great renaissance, if resources, talents, and policies are properly leveraged. Online: Faculty Expanding, energized - good! Getting large and maybe overly-bureaucratic and overly-politically-correct - bad but maybe unavoidable with growth. Online: Faculty Generally a good place to work. Big place that is slow to change. Many employees that have no initiative to strive for excellence in their job...subsequently we have trouble reaching our full potential. Online: Faculty Great medical school. Online: Faculty Great opportunities to grow, if plans are built on a win-win principle. Leadership\/management must be aligned on long term results not short term 'actions' that appear as 'success'. Online: Faculty High ranking academic medical center, quality nursing school Online: Faculty I am excited to be a part of UAB's community. I am honored to be here and look forward to continuing to do meaningful work as a part of UAB. However, I have growing concerns about the future of my program and my department. My most honest impression of UAB is that upper administration would prefer that schools and programs that are not funded by grants disappear. Online: Faculty I started in a graduate program in 2014 and it was on the \"other\" side of campus....meaning, not the medical side. I was not impressed with the appearance of the buildings or cleanliness of the area(mainly the Education Building and towards the fields). During my Internship, I was exposed to other buildings around campus that had received more attention, and the new structures that are amazing. The NEW UAB is something to behold! I also now work in an area of UAB near the 5 Points area, and am afraid to say that there are many campus areas that are unsafe and in much need of repair. There seems to a lack of unity for the vision of the campus in regards to safety and improvements- which is certainly seen through the eyes of anyone with a disability. The buildings that have not seen improvements are not easily accessible (and not large enough bathroom areas) to most groups - blind, deaf and physically challenged. The other issue on campus is parking. I understand that parking decks are the main option for an urban campus, but they are not equipped for the physically challenged driving vehicles with lifts and oversized vehicles. The new open lots have gates that are not equipped with voice activation equipment, making it inaccessible again. Online: Faculty I think it's a great place that sometimes lacks vision. The de-centralized structure sometimes lead to units that do things separate from administration. It would be great if there were a more unified structure and vision Online: Faculty I think that UAB is doing well given the current climate for higher education. However, there are still areas where improvement is necessary. Online: Faculty Impressively progressed since 2001. Online: Faculty It is a wretched hive of scum and villainy Online: Faculty It is growing, and much better than it was when I came 16 years ago; however, in light of a new political climate, I am concerned with growing disrespect, racism, and bigotry on campus among faculty. Online: Faculty It is growing, and much better than it was when I came 16 years ago; however, in light of a new political climate, I am concerned with growing disrespect, racism, and bigotry on campus among faculty. Online: Faculty It's doing OK, mostly. It's a very top-down place: faculty have basically no say in how the place is run. Emphasis seems to be on maximizing revenue to grow the administration. Goal seems to be more students rather than excellence. Still, doing better than many other places. Online: Faculty Lively, diverse, up-and-coming. Campus growing in beauty and substance. Ambitious but not ambitious enough - should strive to be a top tier AAU university. Well resourced but underresourced for the greatness it can achieve - need to attract substantial and more private giving as one of the great national public universities. Online: Faculty people want to see UAB succeed in all areas. University is segmented, and funding for common areas and infrastructure seems to be lacking while some areas seem to have ample funds. Each area seems to be very protective of its resources and reluctant to contribute to a common good. Online: Faculty Ripe with opportunity, disorganized, underperforming Online: Faculty The University does not offer Higher Education doctoral degrees (EdD or Phd) only Elementary Education Online: Faculty There is a mixed bag of positive and negative external and internal opinions. Many of the negative opinions we earn via a culture of not addressing problems, whether they are with people or processes. Online: Faculty UAB is a top notch American university that is relatively young and up and coming. UAB does many things right, but also has areas that need improvement. Online: Faculty UAB is a top-tier institution for clinical care and education and biomedical research. UAB is a low- to mid-tier institution for undergraduate education, and a mid-tier institution for graduate work. Online: Faculty UAB offers a very collaborative environment and has made a great effort to establish infrastructure and resources that facilitate cross-disciplinary research. Importantly, significant support is being provided to junior faculty, as well as multiple opportunities for career development and growth. Online: Faculty UAB states it strives for excellent in Research, Education, and Service. Having been primary a researcher (past), and now primarily an educator\/administrator, it seems UAB's focus is Research and there is just lip service paid to education and service. I am now at a Regional Campus and I often have to field the question \"Are we UAB or aren't we?\" We have all the restrictions of being part of a state university (lower salary, high bureaucracy for even the simplest tasks) with none of the benefits (not Viva UAB providers, staff have to travel to Bham if they choose Viva UAB healthcare, no upward mobility because positions don't grow with the employee, an employee needs to \"change positions\" which is not possible at a small campus, inability to provide residents with \"perks\" because we do not have alternative funding streams available at the main campus). Online: Faculty UAB strives for excellence in some areas however other areas are not provided with necessary support Online: Faculty The UAB culture at the current time has an undercurrent of overbearing risk avoidance. There is an imbalance between the actual risk we face and the over expenditure of resources to avoid that risk. This has led to inefficiency and unnecessary bureaucracy at many levels and in many areas. I believe there should be a comprehensive review of true risk and the policies and procedures we have in place relative to that risk. After review an alignment between actual risk and the resources dedicated to managing that risk. Online: Faculty, Alumnus There may be diversity in number and type of students, but there is very limited inclusivity. Too many of your schools do not embrace and practice true empowerment and share goverance at the faculty level. Online: Faculty, Alumnus, Community member UAB has improved a lot in the last decade. I like the improved campus space for students and the improved branding of the hospital. However, there are a lot of things you can do to be better. Online: Faculty, Alumnus, Community member An urban university in progress. Online: Faculty, Community member Strong academic health center with excellence in teaching, service, & research. Online: Faculty, Community member UAB has a great environment where students and faculty can thrive. Very collaborative. Many opportunities. Online: Faculty, Parent, Community member A university with a lot of pride and dedicated people running it. I was impressed by the IT department. The IT interface is solid and efficient which allows for the university to function smoothly on a day day to basis. I like the talent that UAB attracts and advertises on different lecture series. I was also impressed by how multi-disciplinary it is. Online: Faculty, Staff Vibrant, growing rapidly. Unlimited potential Online: Faculty, Staff I'm proud to be in my 14th year of working at this institution. I work for the hospital, so am not as familiar with the academic side, but am always proud to see reports of the research that is being conducted here. Online: Faculty, Staff, Community member Untapped potential for greatness--choose to go above compliance. More focus on UAB Medicine. We operate in silos. Lack articulated of shared values on the campus side. Online: Staff UAB is a powerhouse of research. UAB is a huge economic driver of Birmingham\/ Jefferson County. UAB is the number one employer within the state of Alabama. UAB is the place to go for top notch\/ state of the art medical care. UAB is transitioning from a commuter college to a full-fledged campus\/ college. UAB is making a good effort to include staff's voice and interest into the shared governance process. UAB is made up of multiple silos; each school\/ department work independently which can be a detriment to the overall mission and vision of the university as a whole. Communication in such a large institution is challenging. UAB is blessed with a tremendous amount of staff talent. UAB's investment into IT infrastructure will propel us further and faster into the future in all aspects of patient care, education and research. UAB's key strength is its diversity and values surrounding diversity. Still in the shadow of UA and AU Online: Staff 1) UAB is growing in a positive way. 2) This University is still being lead by the faculty who wants to do things the old way; programs and departments being siloed and isolated. Online: Staff A bureaucracy which does its best to allocate funds in a manner that is as capricious as it is reckless; a university which rewards and punishes without enough attention to the consequences; an employer who just barely supports its employees with fair and progressive practices. Online: Staff A good one, but the school needs to step out of the shadow of Alabama and Auburn. Many people around the region have either never heard of UAB or think of it as a medical center combined with a suitcase undergraduate program. This is not the case, obviously, but impressions matter when we are trying to recruit that high school kid who grew up an Auburn or Alabama fan and whose parents went to Alabama or Auburn. Online: Staff A major disconnect between the schools and central administration. Seems to be we should all be working for the same goal instead of against each other. Online: Staff a strong dynamic institution on cusp of greatness Online: Staff Dynamic, Progressive, with unlimited potential. Online: Staff Excellent patient care, cutting edge research, great place to work. Online: Staff Excellent patient outcomes, but we can do better with aligning MDs with what we are doing with HCAHPS, cutting waste, improving patient flow Online: Staff Frustration at all levels from students to faculty and staff. I have heard from a number of students that they can't believe that they are paying for the education that they are receiving - it appears that we are expecting less from our students or the faculty teaching the courses are frustrated and it is showing in their courses. Faculty and staff often feel like administration is out to get them. Administration feels that no one understands their plight - everyone is feeling the effects of doing more with less and unfortunately we are turning into a society that is very self involved and therefore there are so few that will go out of their way to say thank you, show appreciation or help others. One of the things that makes UAB great is that it is a very collaborative research environment but that does not appear to be the case once you move out of researchers working together. Our main administrative offices provost, hr, research, finance are unable to come to the table to come up with solutions that will help everyone. Instead everything is very silo'd. Some groups are working to make things easier but taking the time to come up with enterprise wide solutions is time consuming and often uncomfortable because it lessens spheres of influence. UAB also has a history of exceptions - policies and procedures are in place only for certain groups and the squeaky wheels do not have to comply and those that would try to get the squeaky wheels to comply are often stopped or removed from their positions. Online: Staff Good Academic Medical Center with a lot of pride that is faced with many challenges. Unpolished \/ unrefined culture. Seemingly lots of Leadership legacy and challenges in diversification particularly in Senior leadership. Online: Staff Good place to work. Online: Staff Great place to work and receive health care. Online: Staff Great Place to work and seek medical attention. Online: Staff Great place to work and to receive medical care, because UAB truly cares about helping people. Online: Staff Great place to work, receive care. Online: Staff Growing. Urban. Exciting. Changing. Diverse. Regional economic engine. Online: Staff Hospital...everything is geared toward the hospital and health professions. More money is available on the hospital side than on the academic side of the institution. Online: Staff I believe that UAB is growing rapidly and overall we have a bright future Online: Staff I believe UAB is the bright spot for Alabama. I believe the organization (campus & hospital) has made great gains in the last 5 years. Online: Staff I feel like the hiring and advancement processes take too much time to complete. The diversity at this campus is amazing! Online: Staff I feel very lucky to work here. It is a great employer. Online: Staff I love UAB! Have spent my career here and earned more than 1 degree here. Wouldn't go anywhere else. Online: Staff I often get the impression that we feel the need to apologize for who we are as an institution. Perhaps a lack of confidence in who we are and our greatness. We seem to get hung up a great deal on what another institution down the street is doing and think it makes us look better to complain about them. It's almost as if we are in an adolescent, middle-child state of mind. I'd like for us to see ourselves as a mature institution and start to act like it...without apologies. We have many reasons to be proud. Online: Staff I think UAB is a powerhouse in higher education and medical care in the state and I am very proud and honored to be a small part of it. Online: Staff I think we didn't need all the new changes and new management. Online: Staff Immense growth in exciting ways! Online: Staff Improving all the time, but a long way to go. Online: Staff innovative, research-oriented, medical-based, student-focused, community-engaged, patient-focused Online: Staff It is a place that I would seek and advise my family to seek care for any illness. It is a place that speaks about transparency, but I do not truly feel that we are transparent. We do not share near misses or results from patient safety to educate the other areas to avoid the same potential risks. We do not share all data across the hospital. As well data comes from so many sources it is difficult to trust it's integrity. Online: Staff It is the most diversified place I have ever worked. They offer a competitive salary, staying up with the market, and I love working here. Online: Staff It seems to be laid out for the needs of car traffic, not students. Difficult to walk from one building to the next without playing dodge ball with cars. Parking is horrible No bike routes and very few decent bike racks. Reminds me of a University I visited overseas, everything crammed into small space. Online: Staff Its okay Online: Staff large Online: Staff Leader in healthcare--Birmingham and Alabama. Employs some of the best and expert physicians--it is the only hospital I would consider if had a complex medical condition. Online: Staff Medically forward but in many ways behind, such as salaries, embracing divergent thinking and encouraging innovative cultural cohesiveness. Online: Staff Multi-cultural community. Online: Staff My current impressions of UAB are the growth in students, faculty & staff, & patients that are apart of the UAB experience. UAB has tremendously expanded throughout Birmingham and surrounding areas and have made an impact not only in the State of Alabama but Nationwide. Online: Staff NA Online: Staff Needs a HIV\/AIDS clinic Online: Staff New employees have a difficult time navigating through the system. A campus tour and new employee training would be very beneficial. Online: Staff Potential to be very strong nationally, but not quite reaching that potential Online: Staff Progressive Online: Staff That it's a very diverse organization that have people working towards common goals. Online: Staff That we are rapidly growing and have the potential to be a top tier university in the near future Online: Staff The current impression I get is it is a extremely large facility that is struggling daily to keep up with volume demands. There seems to be a lot of \"ball dropping.\" There are so many meetings and committees on efficiency but all that I have attended seem to just talk in circles and not commit to any improvements. Online: Staff The University needs to hire more people with experience from the outside. Too many internal people in positions of great responsibility who have no experience and that includes deans with no former administration experience Online: Staff they accept anyone and should be more strict on admissions. A failing student at community college is going to be a failing student at UAB. Online: Staff Thru traffic needs rerouted around the Campus and only people that need to be at UAB College or Hospitals should be within the parameters. I think it could happen, BSC has done it, I think we can too. Online: Staff UAB as a whole is a wonderful institution but there are some areas with really bad leaders. HR is not trusted with relations issues so employees are silenced and do not feel like they can voice concerns which creates a very unhealthy environment. Also, is UAB really equal opportunity? Very, very often, a department submits an offer letter (staff) to HR prior to the job being posted on the job line. Online: Staff UAB continues to make a significant impact in Birmingham and generates momentum for Birmingham's growth. We are becoming a more recognized institution outside of Alabama. Online: Staff UAB could be viewed by some as a commuter college for those students who live in the vicinity of the Greater Birmingham area who may not have the means, or desire, to attend the state's \"premier\" universities. Fortunately, for what the UAB environment lacks in campus charm, i.e. sprawling oak trees, fraternity\/sorority row houses, etc., it more that matches with the quality of available educational opportunities, from Arts & Sciences to Medical disciplines. Online: Staff UAB does not feel like a university campus or medical center. Too much traffic, too many red lights, and not enough green areas Online: Staff UAB does not value the base of its workforce...maybe the top level employee, but not the rest... neither middle level or lower levels. Online: Staff UAB has a wonderful Optometry Program best rate... Online: Staff UAB has made progress. Online: Staff UAB is a decentralized institution. The lack of collaboration and communication between departments leads to redundancy as well as misinformation. Online: Staff UAB is a great place to work. However, it is highly focused on growth at all levels which isn't always the best practice. Let's focus on what we do well because bigger is not always better. If growth is the desired outcome, it is important to remember that a great infrastructure is key. Online: Staff UAB is a great university that is invested in advancing research in many fields. It is internationally known for many of its programs and its diversity. Online: Staff UAB is a top research university and academic health science center. It is recognized for diversity and has a top tier hospital. It is the largest employer in Alabama. It is also an urban university. Online: Staff UAB is open and inclusive. Online: Staff UAB Medicine is a great place to work and provides high quality care. Online: Staff UAB, in my opinion, has an incredibly diverse and inclusive environment, which is amazing. Online: Staff very busy place Online: Staff Very friendly and dedicated to providing a learning environment for everyone, including staff and faculty. Online: Staff We are moving forward, progressing, growing, but not everything is keeping up with the growth. One area of compliance that needs to be pushed is the Culture of Safety. Online: Staff On the leading edge of research and healthcare - the go to place in the region. Online: Staff, Alumnus UAB is a growing and changing institution. Online: Staff, Alumnus We are so focused on bringing new people into the institution that we do not foster the resources that we already have available at the institution - mentoring programs for faculty, staff, students and postdocs should be expanded. Mentoring is a key part of the research enterprise but is not available for individuals that are not involved directly in research. Online: Staff, Alumnus Cares about employees and patients. Strives to improve in areas where there is room Online: Staff, Alumnus, Community member UAB is a strong and vibrant place to work. I feel like I am challenged each and every day I come to work and that keeps me focused on meeting the end goals. UAB is diverse in it's culture and that leads to a stimulating environment. Online: Staff, Alumnus, Community member UAB is increasingly becoming an attractive university for undergraduates seeking a traditional college experience while receiving an excellent education. Whereas UAB has been known for its excellence in medicine and medical education, all other focus areas of a traditional, well-rounded university are starting to get attention. Online: Staff, Alumnus, Parent UAB is an industry leader in many areas. Fast growing. Building for success. We need to help each area feel like part of the team with better communication. We need to break down silos by creating cross departmental interactions and more authoritative top down management while maintain freedom to do new things. Online: Staff, Alumnus, Parent, Community member great! I love UAB , except for during that time they abandoned the football program from the pressure from UAT. I love what they have done to the campus recently. Online: Staff, Parent A large, fast growing university that does a good job of supporting its minority groups; however, there are still instances where UAB should step in and provide better support. Online: Student As a school it is amazing but the planning committee has been a let down. The new student center is well designed but the in-house services are terrible. Much of the wasted space could have been turned into smaller study areas for students which would have made it easier to get some work done and perhaps eat and hangout with some friends. The food is just terrible. The previous set-up (including Taco Bell and Chic-Fil-A) was better than what is being provided today. You should either bring back those restaurants or introduce some new food in the student center. Online: Student As compared to other universities, UAB doesn't really have a \"campus feel.\" The weekends are usually dead, and there isn't much incentives to stay on campus. That being said, I love UAB's diversity and the opportunities it offers. Online: Student Excellent academic curriculum but the perpetual lack of parking is really getting out of hand. Online: Student Faculty do not communicate with one another. Faculty do not know what students have learned. Some faculty forget that some of us are being exposed to topics for the first time, yet come in with a lot of expectations. (Seems like they forgot what it was like to be a student.) A handful of faculty are more proactive and empathetic of our situation. Online: Student Good but Not enough room for growth Online: Student Good, overpriced for out of state healcare tuition Online: Student Great school, extremely diverse. Online: Student I am a 100% on-line student. The UAB teachers I've had the pleasure of having are professional, polite and down to earth. Some still try to keep the online class similar to in person, which appears like a lot more work since all work is done remotely and on an electronic device. Online: Student I am a distance student. I have been pleased with my education at UAB. Online: Student There have been several instances of discriminatory behavior that have affected me both directly, and indirectly. When complaints about faculty being discriminatory are brought up they are filed away and the faculty is able to continue with their career while they have damaged the careers of students in their tracks. I believe it is not a great precedence for someone in the leadership role of the next generation of scientists to not be properly reprimanded when they have been caught in inappropriate behavior. It is also disheartening to see faculty that complaints have been made about be awarded. Online: Student I have been very happy with UAB! Online: Student I like it Online: Student I love it. but some buildings are very old (education building) and the residence halls need to be expanded. With better lighting. The lighting is dark and dreadful in some of the residence halls. Online: Student Iffy Online: Student Incredible school. Very green and technologically up to date. Modern and well maintained. Online: Student It is a piece o ?. Online: Student It's an excellent and well-kept campus. I like the security measure put in over the years and the accessibility to the staff in the student center, health centers, etc. Online: Student It's okay. I think UAB is a safe and clean campus, overall. Online: Student It's very lackluster. I got my undergraduate degree from The University of Alabama, and in comparison the buildings here are no where close to being up-to-date. The facilities in a lot of the buildings are disappointing. The maintenance staff doesn't take pride in their work. My research lab in Campbell Hall has dirty floors, there are leaves all in the hallway, the bathrooms are always out of toilet paper, and our trash MIGHT get taken out once a week, which is when we complain that it hasn't been taken out. It just seems that work ethic is lacking from a lot of the staff members. Dedicated faculty deserve up-to-date facilities, especially in the biology department when there are so many biology majors at UAB. The teaching labs are pathetic. I'm a TA for BY123 and those labs haven't been touched in years. Another area that is lacking is parking. I'm a graduate student, and sometimes I pull late nights on campus. I don't feel safe walking to the express lots by myself at night, and the blazer buses are the most unreliable university bus system. Once again, a lack of pride by employees. I've seen a driver sitting at a bus stop for 20 minutes without moving. I can't trust the bus system, and I don't feel safe walking to the new parking options provided en lieu of 15A. Overall there seems to be a lack of caring for the students UAB currently has. I have a difficult time thinking of GOOD things to say about UAB and my experiences thus far, and I'm the third year of my PhD. Online: Student Love it, but parking is horrible Online: Student N\/A Online: Student none Online: Student Not very good, I've never seen a school so unorganized. Online: Student One rather annoying--but telling--trait of Auburn students is that they never shut up about how much they love their school. I never seem to hear this from other UAB students. I believe most of us feel that UAB is more interested in giving us parking tickets than ensuring our safety. I can park \"illegally\" in a lot I paid $130 to have access to, and get ticketed within an hour. However, students are continually robbed and assaulted on campus when the obvious answer would be to invest more money in police officers to patrol the parking decks rather than to hire meter maids. I love the education I am getting at UAB, but I cannot say I love UAB. As far as I, and many others, can see, UAB has done nothing but take our money and disregard our safety. Online: Student Parking is bad, but impossible if you get to campus after 9am. Shuttle is very unreliable and hard to keep up with. Online: Student Personally, I feel that UAB is a top-rate institution that I am proud to be part of. The facilities are (overall) fantastic, and the professors are stellar. It is my desire for all of my children, family, and friends to become a UAB Blazer. Online: Student Pretty good, the professors are dedicated and the people are nice. The commons staff in particular are really wonderful! Online: Student Really good overall, but parking for commuters is getting really bad, especially now that the big parking lot across from Campbell Hall has been demolished. Online: Student The construction and blocking of roads\/bridges\/walkways is very annoying and inconvenient. The gym facilities are nice. The parking situation is really not good unless you arrive at school by about 7 AM. Online: Student The world class education offered does not match the appearance of the school. From the logo, to outdated buildings the school looks and feels \"old\" although it is not compared to other historically established institutions. I also see a large prejudice against out of state students. Not only is preference given to Alabama state students during application process, if an out of state student is selected for a program the tuition is unreasonably high. Out of state students expect to pay more for an education outside of their home state, but not more than DOUBLE the cost of what an in state student pays. It sets students up for significant loads of student debt, for no real reason other than the student chose to attend an out of state school for a prestigious education. UAB offers some of the greatest health care programs in the southeast and that shouldn't be reserved for only Alabama residents. Overall, I am extremely impressed with the accessibility and credibility of faculty and staff. Online: Student This university plays a pivotal role in Birmingham and the entire state of Alabama. Its leadership spans beyond teaching and research as the university brings hope for a brighter future for this city. UAB also represents inclusiveness. I had many apprehension when I was starting my journey as a masters student at the school of public health, but I can say the two years I have spent in this university will probably have a considerable impact in my career. More than the quality of teaching, the \"UAB experience\" plays a key role in holding together the passion and the proudness people of every origin have being part of this institution. Online: Student UAB as a university is in a league of many American universities that represent an unknown acronym. Prior to moving here, I had never heard of UAB before. But while UAB doesn't have the reputation of some other schools, UAB is a diamond in the rough and has a lot to be proud of, like its medical campus and its research efforts. Online: Student UAB has A LOT of potential. It is unfortunate that people view UAB as a commuter school, but I think any step away from this identity will make UAB seem a lot more lively and interesting to prospective and even current students. The Commons- The staff is excellent! They are all so kind. I think that instead of focusing on making diverse and different foods each week, the Commons should focus on the quality of a certain amount of meals. The Commons does not provide enough food\/food options for the amount of people who eat there. Online: Student UAB is a beautiful, modern campus. Online: Student UAB is a good college, I feel safe when on campus. The parking is not ideal. Online: Student UAB is a great school where the faculty and staff genuinely care about the wellbeing of others. Online: Student UAB is a great university that has a lot of potential to be one of the top universities in the country in relation to the level of student involvement and the academic opportunities that are available to students. Online: Student UAB is a place where students go for higher education opportunities. We are very strong on academics but fall short on the social life of students. We have social organizations but there is no unity between them. My undergrad experience has ended as soon as I moved out of Blazer my freshman year. My only reason to return to campus is for class and practice. (Student Athlete) Online: Student UAB is fine currently. However, there is always room for improvement. The biggest area I can think to improve would be the advisers. I have had 4 different advisers since I became a student here and only my most recent adviser, Tyna Adams, has helped me at all. The others simply told me things I already knew and the appointments were all useless. Online: Student UAB is run by the Board of Trustees that doesn't care about UAB but only cares about the University of Alabama and does not have the community's best interest in mind Online: Student UAB really cares about attracting freshmen. Online: Student We need more parking Online: Student It's great that I am seeing renovations and improvements in facilities available to students, faculty, and staff. Online: Student, Alumnus I am a Birmingham native, and must admit that I previous viewed UAB as the local commuter school, and was not aware of all the excellent things UAB is doing. After being at UAB for a couple of years, I couldn't be more proud to be a part of this community. However, UAB's reputation does not reflect the reality. Also, I believe UAB has lot of potential to move quickly and emerge as a leader in higher ed, but needs focus on maximize that potential. New administration is effective, forward-thinking, and have been responsive to students. However, communication across the institution is quite poor, and many times resources.efforts are duplicated or wasted. Online: Student, Alumnus, Community member I love UAB. It is a great academically successful university. Parking is awful. Online: Student, Community member My current impressions of UAB is that is a vastly underrated school to students outside of the Birmingham metro area. I grew up in a small town 20 miles north of Birmingham, Hayden,AL. and my impressions of UAB growing up were that it played second fiddle to UA and Auburn. I even went to Alabama for a year to study Management Information Systems, but it turned out that that was not my passion so I changed majors to Management with a concentration in Production & Operations Management and moved home to attend UAB. Over the past two years I have grown to love UAB and I am currently interning with a great company that I would have never known about had I not met one of the professors in the business school, Scott Watson. All of the professors I have come into contact with at the business school have been nothing but gracious and caring to me. Including, but not limited to; Ave Jack, Jack Howard, Philip Musa, Steve Yoder, Randall Kornegay, Dr. Wech, Evan Duggan, Michael Padalino and many many more. The career services center in the business school does an outstanding job connecting students with opportunities. Andrea Pound is great at what she does and ensures that students are advised correctly and really helped me in my transition to UAB from UA. Online: Student, Community member Perceptions of School of Education are very poor. Students frequently discuss lack of investment of faculty\/ staff, poor administrative handling of advising, programming, placements, etc. School of Ed is not student centered, does not support students for career success. \"Weak links\" such as school of ed seriously damage UAB's reputation in community. Online: Student, Community member UAB has a great campus that has done a fantastic job of meshing with the urban landscape of Birmingham in all but one very important way, a distrinct lack of parking. Online: Student, Community member I feel that UAB is a good organization. However, there are some people here who stain the UAB reputation for being fair and equitable in terms of racial and gender equality. The office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion has focused heavily upon the rights of the LGBTQ community, that women's right and those of minorities have slipped through the cracks. If you begin to pull the data of salaries and compensation, you will see huge disparities between those of white males and other minority groups. Not only are there disparities in pay but also job titles. Education has no role in the hiring process. The hiring process is so political that many applicants are deterred from applying to jobs because often the job has been promised to someone else. I am speaking in reference to the hospital positions. Education, experience and skill are becoming less important and how well you \"mesh\" with the norm is of greater importance. I think UAB is an excellent organization but has become convoluted with a regime of bullies and cronies. Online: Student, Faculty, Staff, Alumnus, Parent, Community member UAB is a good school in a dangerous area with less than adequate security and parking. Online: Student, Faculty, Staff, Alumnus, Parent, Community member UAB traps its employees. the point system is a bit ridiculous and its hard to keep up with points. its not fair that employees receive points (at the managers' discretion), yet cant pull up the list for themselves to help stay on top. I think that the point system should be abolished. Online: Student, Faculty, Staff, Parent, Community member A powerhouse of a campus that has not yet utilized appropriate funding to make it more accessible. Online: Student, Staff As of right now, UAB needs to have better communication between departments and entities. UAB needs to have the latest technology. For example, at St. Vincent's they have check in tablets that patients use to cut down the amount of time it takes to check in. Patients can also pay their co-pay by using this tablet. Online: Student, Staff Extremely positive. Online: Student, Staff Good overall glad we are rebuilding and updating buildings Online: Student, Staff I have been employed with UAB for 30+ years, and I know what a great university UAB is; however, I am not so sure that those individuals outside UAB realize how great we are. When I first started here in 1985 working in the School of Engineering; most of my family\/friends did not even realize that UAB had a Sch of Engineering - that is not the case today. I still think improvements are needed in marketing and publicizing our great institution. There is so much here that UAB has to offer! Online: Student, Staff Lots of talk of diversity and inclusion with only minimal action and support. Online: Student, Staff UAB is an excellent academic school in a lot of key areas. We also house some of the best research teams in the country and are on the brink of being one of the top research institutes. There are some facets of UAB that could use continual improvement if we are to make the push to one of the best institutions in the country. Our Computer Science program has been on the rise, but I believe to be one of the best we need to compare our curriculum with those of other top institutions, such as UC-Berkeley, MIT, Stanford, and Washington. Online: Student, Staff It doesn't value commuters, which is very sad considering its masters programs and those who work at the hospital and also go to school. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus We have a great team of people and lots of resources to achieve our objectives on both the campus and medical center. There is a lot more work to do to turn us into an optimally functioning team. In terms of diversity, there is a lot more to be done to match leadership makeup with the employee makeup and community makeup. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus Strong attempts to improve diversity and inclusion. Also appears to have strong attempts to get the voice of all versus just making dictatorship type decisions. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member That UAB is one of the most successful facilities in the south, however it overworks its front line staff with very little compensation. The number of people, that I have personally seen, that have left this facility for more pay and less work is absolutely disheartening. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member UAB is a world renowned medical facility. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member UAB is one of the top research and medical Universities in the United States. I have worked here for over 20 years, 2 years in Nutrition Science, 1 year in Pulmonary Medicine, and 21 years in the Biology Department. I have seen monumental positive changes and progress in my years at UAB. Students now have a living and dynamic campus with sports, multi-cultural events, art, music, engaging classroom and lab experiences, and a level of diversity that is unparalleled at most other Universities. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member There is a false sense of inclusion here at UAB. It is changing however, towards a more 21st century competitive institution that welcomes and includes all people. Online: Student, Staff, Community member My impression is that the current President of the UAB is a lackey for the BoT and is here to undermine UAB in favor of UA at ever turn. Online: Parent, Community member UAB is an awesome University for the students perusing the medical related and research fields. Online: Parent, Community member Excited to see the student growth and the revitalization plans to become a traditional campus. UAB has a lot to offer and is one of the most underrated schools in the south. Online: Alumnus Good school, great reputation. Lack of a real 'campus' feel. Online: Alumnus I am very impressed with the new construction on campus. The new student center looks amazing from the Interstate, and the while driving by on University Boulevard. I am looking forward to the new Arts and Sciences Building, the School of Business Building, and the Athletics Construction, especially the new Football Practice Facility. I attended UAB and graduated with a degree from the School of Business. I have always been UAB's biggest endorser. My son is attending UAB. My daughter is planning on attending UAB in the fall of 2018 when she graduates from high school. My daughter and I attended a campus tour in November, and I was very impressed with the reserved parking space with her name on the sign. Also, I enjoyed seeing her name on the display in the student center in the meeting room. This really made her feel welcomed. Also, one of the tour guides spent a lot of time with her and got to know her very well. That tour guide also followed with a post card. I have always viewed UAB as the flagship University of the state. After all, it is in the largest city in the state of Alabama. There are many reasons why UAB enrollment increased so much during the past year. Online: Alumnus Impressive campus, always bustling with activity, continuous construction projects (yeah!) Online: Alumnus It is teeming with potential for growth, and ithat growth is just beginning. Online: Alumnus Positive Online: Alumnus UAB is under the thumb of a Board of Trustees that serves the best interest of the University of Alabama and is intentionally sabotaging UAB. Online: Alumnus Very proud of UAB; Medical Center and college. Online: Alumnus Pleased that UAB is now asking for input. Something that hasn't been done in the past. I am still embarrassed that such a great institution closed athletic teams rather than taking legitimate steps to improve them. I am glad steps have been made to correct this. To be a national cancer center, the pediatric side of oncology is severely lacking. Online: Alumnus, Community member UAB has lost it's way. The university has not addressed student parking. More student parking decks is needed. The libraries are a mess. Both libraries have less space due to office space taking up space used by students. Both libraries should be for student use to study. Lister Hill Library lack of a coffee shop or Star Bucks is disappointing. Both libraries need all floors of the library renovated for student use. Edge of Chaos and INTO should not be taking up space. You can barely find a plug for your lap top in either library to accommodate student. P.S....this is why the libraries are hardly used in comparison to more modern college libraries. We need plugs, a place to sit and coffee. Sterne Library was renovated the first floor in 2010 but the remaining floors hark back to the 1970s. The Student center is unimpressive and lacks charm. The HUC had charm and was functional. The HUC also had better food options. The 3 restaurants in the HSC are too expensive. You need a mix of cheap and expensive food. Stop building new buildings and dorms as if there is an arms race. Prepare for the well to run dry. Save money and pass the savings on to the students via tuition reduction. Get more input from students before making decisions. Online: Alumnus, Community member innovative Online: Community member An institution that wants to be great but hasn't quite figured out how to do it. Online: None given an organization comprised of very dedicated and intelligent clinicians Online: None given Big Online: None given Diverse Online: None given Frustratingly naive, unorganized, each area is out for their own, lack of common purpose, true communication, and open collaboration. A telling\/directive institution where the leaders don't effectively lead and certainly don't allow others in on their decision making process, government\/militaristic approach to the workforce. Online: None given Good place to work with good benefits, lots of opportunities for improvement - LMS, Oracle, policies and procedures in all areas, some work areas Online: None given Good place to work. Administration is working to change things to better UAB for the World and their Employees to see. We have a good benefits package just wish the Health Insure was a bit cheaper on both ends (co-payments and monthly cost) Online: None given Having extreme difficulty shaking off its outdated stereotype of a gritty commuter\/part-time\/night-school\/branch campus Online: None given I like it, but I hate the parking. Online: None given It is impossible to park at UAB and UAB doesn't care about it. UAB only cares about money. Online: None given It's good but there needs to be some improvements Online: None given Siloed Online: None given Strong community effort Online: None given Strong foundation, excellent education, in slight uph avail due to faculty changes but still high quality. Online: None given UAB does biomedical research very well, but provides inadequate support to other fields of study. This bias suppresses advancements in other fields and limits opportunities for faculty to expand their professional development. Talented faculty leave because their opportunities are limited. For a simple example, the current budget model at UAB is ideal for biomedical research but inadequate and even prohibitive for other fields. In the School of Education, the current budget doesn't support faculty research, graduate assistantships, etc. There is no money for marketing of graduate programs, not enough money for adequate administrative support, grossly inadequate support for grant applications, poor infrastructure for carrying out grants, no funds for incentivizing performance, no say in performance evaluations for the development staff, and the list goes on. Online: None given UAB is a great institution . We have made great strides regarding Equity and Diversity on the Campus. We must make similar investment for the Health System. Online: None given UAB is a multipurpose institution that has many highly educated and experienced specialists working to achieve their specific departmental priorities. UAB is siloed, segmented, and lacks open communication within and across departments, schools, management levels, student groups, etc. Online: None given ? - What do you hear form your earliest graduates in SON? - They still come around - many are in nursing homes\/assisted living now, but many are amazed at what is going on now. Their focus is on the hospital. They want to tour the new health-related buildings. WE have worked on changing their old feelings of \"I'm not UAB?\" Though they were trained in the hospital, they are UAB. They paved the way. In-person response from listening sessions ? - Doctors identified with Tuscaloosa rather than UAB? - it's getting better. The older they get, the more the culture can change. In-person response from listening sessions \"Not on radar if not talking about medical center.\" In-person response from listening sessions [In radiology they were informed they had to keep their own space clean. Floors would be vacuumed once a quarter and all trash cans had to be outside the office to be emptied In-person response from listening sessions 10 years here. Some of my impressions of the university may be biased. Talk about the university rather than the undergraduate side. \"University-side.\" Move beyond graduate side\/undergraduate side. Declarations that come down from on high that screw up teaching. So many decisions without the account of actual instructors' needs, etc. New administrators being hired - why? How much are they being paid? Need to improve our impression and how others view UAB. UA is undergrad. UAB is the research. In other states, the research university is more highly regarded. WE need to start thinking about ourselves as the top class university because of our research. Decisions are made and no thought of how it will impact others. We could truly leverage who we are much more. In-person response from listening sessions 3rd tier institution - excellent faculty in some areas by excellence is not very dense In-person response from listening sessions Absence of conflict In-person response from listening sessions Academic leader in State In-person response from listening sessions Academically very high quality. In-person response from listening sessions Administrative regulations are oppressive - prevents innovation In-person response from listening sessions After a few years of rough times, and the Athletics decision. On the upswing. The great unknown with healthcare is a big concern. In-person response from listening sessions All money goes to the medical side. In-person response from listening sessions Allen asked about possible residence life transformations? - Definitely lost its reputation as a commuter campus, but could still be improved. In-person response from listening sessions Amazing In-person response from listening sessions Amazing faculty In-person response from listening sessions Another student was given a 3 week wait. Ultimately solved but would have been better to get in during the moment. In-person response from listening sessions Anybody can get into UAB In-person response from listening sessions Apologetic for who we are In-person response from listening sessions Arcane business practices In-person response from listening sessions Are we a minority university? NO. One of the things we should push is that we are a diverse university that's getting mainstream university. (need to be over 50 percent minority - I'm not sure we're eligible) Not the point. Glad we're not at a minority institution that kind of gets separated from potential. In-person response from listening sessions Attracting more in number and geographically diverse students In-person response from listening sessions Balance medicine and non-medicine In-person response from listening sessions Bean counters make faculty job harder rather than easier. In-person response from listening sessions Because we have so many first generation students and more diverse and appeal to a different sort of student. We matter more to our students' lives. We're making a bigger difference in their lives than other universities could. We're not party school. Studnets are trying desperately to improve their economic situation and their life outcomes. Core of our mission and identity. In-person response from listening sessions Becoming more bureaucratic In-person response from listening sessions Best kept secret In-person response from listening sessions Best kept secret In-person response from listening sessions Big on research In-person response from listening sessions Bigger effort to put departments together. Was hard to get people to be together and work together. It leads to collaboration with other members that have similar research interests. Purpose and directions with new buildings. In-person response from listening sessions Bigger is not always better. Concern about rapid growth. Can't be all things to all people. The Joe Volker model is still relevant. In-person response from listening sessions Biggest employer in Alabama In-person response from listening sessions Boston associates it with the hospital. I was just in the grocery store last night, and lady recognized her doctors were there and asked what unit (in the hospital) I worked in. Maybe time for a lot of the other programs to \"grow up\" In-person response from listening sessions Budget model is not transparent In-person response from listening sessions Bureaucracy is excessive In-person response from listening sessions Bureaucracy just stops you even when you are funding things yourself In-person response from listening sessions Bureaucratic In-person response from listening sessions Bureaucratic. Started out with a great vision about educating the local community. Over course of last years, turned into a bureaucracy of the highest order. Support staff and administrators faculty don't need. 5th floor of CAS don't know what we do. We don't know what they do. No contact with people at the top. It's another thing to actually speak on a one-on-one basis with administrators. If we're not in the bureaucratic system, they don't know us. Not contact like we used to have. The average level of most of the students is abysmal. My impression is that the UAB administration in terms of getting warm bodies has become an open admissions university at the undergraduate level - obviously different at the grad level. We are in a poor state with poor K-12 infrastructure. It has gotten worse. Difficult to say when the turn of the bureaucracy happened. I'm not sure what's being done in K-12, but perhaps our side of campus should make inroads to the high schools in the community to have contact with faculty in the high schools and they have contact with us. Student engagement and other devices (FB), they have a different expectation that was was the case before social media. In-person response from listening sessions Business operations are not user friendly. In-person response from listening sessions Busy place In-person response from listening sessions Came from a private university. All the money was on the medical side. The undergrad side always felt slighted. I came here due to the commitment to diversity, but it does produce disparity of students. Complex. The insider view tends to make us jaded and perhaps self-deprecating as we are. Commitment to diversity and the community. I worry about the administrative density and opacity. In-person response from listening sessions Campus improvements In-person response from listening sessions Campus run around. \"Let me transfer you....\" Where can you call that you can get answers and \"one stop.\" Given help, but \"passing the buck\" customer service - ownership of helping. In-person response from listening sessions Can we move the cars out of the center of campus? Makes traffic and parking difficult for us and our patients. In-person response from listening sessions Centralized scheduling of space makes it difficult to collaborate in teaching and research In-person response from listening sessions Changes to the core In-person response from listening sessions CLARIFYING QUESTION: Ranking among other universities? ANSWER: Very high. You always hear that we're probably appreciated more outside of BHM than inside. But that's changing. In-person response from listening sessions Collaborate across disciplines In-person response from listening sessions Collaborative - easy to work across boundaries In-person response from listening sessions Collaborative ethos In-person response from listening sessions Community excited about UAB In-person response from listening sessions Community leader - reputation In-person response from listening sessions Community not aware of groundbreaking research In-person response from listening sessions Commuters are looking for spaces to store their stuff during the day while they're here. In-person response from listening sessions Complex - many things going on In-person response from listening sessions Complex institution going in too many directions all at once In-person response from listening sessions Complex system to navigate for employees In-person response from listening sessions Complex! Lot of things going on. In-person response from listening sessions Constant change In-person response from listening sessions Constant need to do more with less In-person response from listening sessions Constantly growing In-person response from listening sessions Construction everywhere In-person response from listening sessions Culture of \"NO\" In-person response from listening sessions Culture of strategic planning exists, but dentistry gets penalized because we are so successful - please keep investing in our success. In-person response from listening sessions Current expectations about grant funding has not changed in 20 years but reality of grant funding has changed dramatically In-person response from listening sessions Decentralization causes inequities In-person response from listening sessions Decentralized into silos In-person response from listening sessions Declarations come down from on high without considering implications for classroom teaching. In-person response from listening sessions Defining our tradition In-person response from listening sessions Depending on your area, your silo\/school\/unit, your perception may not be the same. Great pockets of greatness. Be wonderful to share those pockets of greatness because we're so large and complex. In-person response from listening sessions Developing it's identify. Focus on medical side once, but that's shifting. We got to let people know! Tell our story. In-person response from listening sessions Dichotomy between people do the teaching and the bureaucracy In-person response from listening sessions Difficult to communicate to housing relative to bike security, etc. In-person response from listening sessions Disciplinary alignment is needed beyond the medical\/healthcare side of campus. In-person response from listening sessions Disconnect between people designing facilities and people teaching In-person response from listening sessions Disconnected and Overlap? - just student side? Infrastructure? What other barriers might exist? - Geographically not linked - almost promoting off-campus\/commuters. In-person response from listening sessions Disconnected units In-person response from listening sessions Diverse In-person response from listening sessions Diverse In-person response from listening sessions Diverse but not united around central theme. Much overlap but rarely coordinated In-person response from listening sessions Diverse student body that gets along with one another In-person response from listening sessions Diversity In-person response from listening sessions Diversity - students and services In-person response from listening sessions Diversity issues In-person response from listening sessions Diversity produces disparity. In-person response from listening sessions Diversity, middle of an upward trajectory, exciting. In-person response from listening sessions Do a good job with undergraduates In-person response from listening sessions Do not have core infrastructure to do great research In-person response from listening sessions Do they feel like \"Yeah I'm a Blazer\" all the time. UA has football, but will that work here? In-person response from listening sessions Doing very well. Lots of progress. I have been happy with my move. In general it's going very well. International students (INTO) progress. Even with FB. UAB has a good opportunity to recruit central American students. In-person response from listening sessions Don't cooperate across school lines In-person response from listening sessions Don't seem to want to be great in something. In-person response from listening sessions Dynamic - welcomes change In-person response from listening sessions Easy to recruit to UAB because of academic strength\/reputation In-person response from listening sessions Economic driving force of local community In-person response from listening sessions Economic engine In-person response from listening sessions Economic engine of State In-person response from listening sessions Employee wellness is through hospital. University side doesn't necessarily know that we even have a wellness center for employees. In-person response from listening sessions Engaged people In-person response from listening sessions Even a simple e-mail has be reviewed and reviewed In-person response from listening sessions Even in buildings it is hard to get around In-person response from listening sessions Events not well communicated in a timely manner In-person response from listening sessions Every meeting I go to is attended by some new high paid administrator. In-person response from listening sessions Evolving university In-person response from listening sessions Excessive administration with little accountability In-person response from listening sessions Excitement is much higher In-person response from listening sessions Exciting times In-person response from listening sessions Exponential increase in Assistant Vice Presidents In-person response from listening sessions Facilities greatly improved. In-person response from listening sessions Faculty not engaged in or supportive of service learning in local neighborhoods. In-person response from listening sessions Faculty shortage already In-person response from listening sessions Faculty very accessible to students In-person response from listening sessions Faculty, in general, not as competent in Canvas and other online tools as students. Faculty needs technological help. In-person response from listening sessions Family In-person response from listening sessions Family. In-person response from listening sessions Feel UAB is unique not just because of its city setting, but also because of our diverse student population. In-person response from listening sessions Fernando (USGA President) talked with other SGA presidents and others are fighting to have these types of conversations. UAB does a great job with that. We are at the next level that other SGAs are trying to get to. We actually get to be involved. In-person response from listening sessions Fernando talked about health and wellness - I heard from students that theres a backlog to get into the counseling center especially when finals are approaching. In-person response from listening sessions FOLLOW-UP QUESTION: Impressions of amount of centralization\/decentralization? ANSWER: Medical and university \"sides.\" WE have improved in trying to make us one. In-person response from listening sessions Football back In-person response from listening sessions Football is coming back. Basketball is going strong. Sports are technically commercials for recruitment. Like a front door of the university to the world. In-person response from listening sessions Forward thinking In-person response from listening sessions Getting a buzz in nursing In-person response from listening sessions Good ideas go nowhere In-person response from listening sessions Good place for career development In-person response from listening sessions Good place to be if you are an undergraduate In-person response from listening sessions Good place to work In-person response from listening sessions Good resources In-person response from listening sessions Good to give schools their independence, but the vision\/communication\/direction needs to be one. We all need to have pride. We all need to celebrate our strengths. Balancing Autonomy\/independence with common cause. In-person response from listening sessions Good to have independence\/autonomy\/decentralization but need more uniformity, consistency and centralization of vison and where we are going In-person response from listening sessions Great at very top and very bottom but big GREY area in between In-person response from listening sessions Great facilities and great technological infrastructure. Very good \"facelift\" over a few years ago. In-person response from listening sessions Great research and teaching in CAS - hindered by lack of appreciation in the institution (administration) In-person response from listening sessions Great School In-person response from listening sessions Greatly improved facilities In-person response from listening sessions Growing In-person response from listening sessions Growing In-person response from listening sessions Growing institution In-person response from listening sessions Growing school In-person response from listening sessions Hard to change perception as medical university. In-person response from listening sessions Hard to do group\/team work in existing facilities In-person response from listening sessions Hard to get a job here In-person response from listening sessions Hard to park In-person response from listening sessions Have to know insiders to successfully navigate system In-person response from listening sessions Health related In-person response from listening sessions Hindered by UA System Board of Trustees and their lack of allegiance to UAB. In-person response from listening sessions How about alumni parking? In-person response from listening sessions How important is athletics to you? - Good for unity around a cohesive identity and excited about UAB Football. In-person response from listening sessions I come from NC. What drew me to UAB is that I was surprised when I got here how progressive and how it has moved and continues to move forward. The opportunity for continued growth. Room for improvement. This is not a broken system. UAB medicine was strong - didn't know how strong. Dentistry is moving forward well. Very real support from the highest levels of administration for continued improvement and growth. In-person response from listening sessions I disagree - I think that there's a confusion in terms of the teaching mission - seems to me that there are various standards between departments within CAS that are probably rooted in history. In-person response from listening sessions I don't think that online courses is the way to go. We need to make personal contact with people in our fields and develop networks and social capital. - Allen does the mix feel right? - I have personally stopped taking online courses. I prefer the face-to-face. I think it's helpful for plugging gaps, but as a student I'm not interested. In-person response from listening sessions I grew up in BHM - I honestly looked-over UAB b\/c it was too close to home. Hoover and Mtn. Brook is underrated to htem. Touring the campus enlightened me about what UAB students could accomplish. I tell them what I'm accomplishing my friends say \"wow!\" I have a friend who's at Harvard they say \"cool\" UAB \"oh\" they (even at Harvard) don't have such opportunity (research and hands-on experiences). In-person response from listening sessions I haven't been to campus since 1969. In-person response from listening sessions I think it's a bit of (at least for CAS) we have a small liberal arts college within the larger university. We know our studnets by name, lots of projects that cross boundaries, not lose any of that, but market what we're doing better. In-person response from listening sessions I think it's one that's recurring - growing and aspirant peers- we are apologetic for who we are. Adolescent. We're a big institution and should act that way. WE still grapple with who we are to ...keeping apologizing. Tentative to claim our seat at the table. In-person response from listening sessions I took an informal meeting with Alumni (6 people) at my office. Happy to have football back, glad to have Football facilities up and running to the degree that it should have been back when we became Division I. New HSC is fantastic. In-person response from listening sessions I work for CTS and we hire a lot of UAB. Since I attended UAB, the employers that we're attracting are not just regional - it's national. In-person response from listening sessions I would question what our mission is. I would argue any admissible student in Alabama. We have a moral obligation to train the C level student to help them help society. Them being a teaching challenge or not. In-person response from listening sessions I'd prefer the stadium to be on campus for walkability. In-person response from listening sessions I'd say the same for Nursing. They moved in late 60's so some do still identify with UA, but that's changing. May be a long time before that's a thing of the past. They have a separate Alumni Council. In-person response from listening sessions Idea of new stadium is great. Should be on campus. In-person response from listening sessions If it could go down to southside to pick up commuters. Go out further to the community - five points. Publix. In-person response from listening sessions If stadium is not on campus, then how are those who don't cars get to the games. In-person response from listening sessions Images of UAB - too little self-confidence In-person response from listening sessions Improved institutional pride In-person response from listening sessions In general there's a vibe here that UAB's a postivie partner rather than just something that's there. More openness In-person response from listening sessions Inclusive and diverse environment In-person response from listening sessions Incredibly bureaucratic. Makes international travel with students virtually impossible In-person response from listening sessions Infrastructure needs to keep pace with growth In-person response from listening sessions Infrastructure not good, silos, hard to get around campus In-person response from listening sessions Infrastructure not keeping up In-person response from listening sessions Innovation, involvement In-person response from listening sessions Institutionally unfocused - scattered In-person response from listening sessions Interactions with the city is not good. More interactions with city are needed. U. of Chicago has a good model. Never utilized the resources of the BCRI archives. WE have typically just coexisted. We're sitting in the middle of the civil rights location but don't utilize it fully. I don't agree with the decrease in the quality of the students. It's increasing ACT, GPAs - definitely under president garrison. That said we do teach to a huge range of undergrads so there may be some that shouldn't be there along with top notch students. Overall quality has improved dramatically. In-person response from listening sessions Interface with community In-person response from listening sessions Internal communications not good In-person response from listening sessions Is UAB on the radar when outside looking in? In-person response from listening sessions Is UCSD really in the same metric as UAB (student GPA and acceptance rate, research funding, faculty accomplishments)? In-person response from listening sessions It's amazing! So much to offer here. We hear this from our alumni. Can't believe how much positive change has happened? In-person response from listening sessions It's important that we are tied to BHM for better or for worse and that relationship is important. In-person response from listening sessions John Jones mentioned that the wellness center is another area where admin. Has listened and continued to improve. In-person response from listening sessions Just to develop a brochure takes months In-person response from listening sessions Known only as medical center In-person response from listening sessions Lagging in area of mental health In-person response from listening sessions Largest employer in Alabama In-person response from listening sessions Leadership not approachable In-person response from listening sessions Leadership role in region - public\/private partnerships In-person response from listening sessions Less centralized - People don't feel like they have any control over their destiny In-person response from listening sessions Less entrepreneurial In-person response from listening sessions Less expensive In-person response from listening sessions Less of a commuter\/working-student school. In-person response from listening sessions Like that UAB focuses on service learning. Take what we learn and put it out there in the community. Referenced the 99 neighborhoods. In-person response from listening sessions Like the sustainability theme but needs to go beyond engineering. In-person response from listening sessions Limited resources relative to projected growth In-person response from listening sessions Little brother mentality. Little brother to UA in particular. In-person response from listening sessions Little brother to UA In-person response from listening sessions Little communication among schools In-person response from listening sessions Little focus on students or faculty In-person response from listening sessions Local people never consider UAB In-person response from listening sessions Local recruitment of students In-person response from listening sessions Lockers for off campus students In-person response from listening sessions Longboarding bike area and storage? Bike lockers are in a most inconvenient places. No announcement of bike racks being moved. They look fancy but they're not really functional. In-person response from listening sessions Losing too many people to other institutions In-person response from listening sessions Lot of great universities can do a lot of things well, but we don't seem to say the same thing In-person response from listening sessions Lot of redundancies and potential inefficiencies. Tutoring services for example for undergraduate students. How students make appointments with advisors and how can we look at those things across the campus. In-person response from listening sessions Lot of run around - people say \"don't transfer me to another operator I have already talked to 3\" In-person response from listening sessions Lots of growth In-person response from listening sessions Maintenance a major problem In-person response from listening sessions Maintenance staff has incentive to do things well In-person response from listening sessions Marketing is a real problem In-person response from listening sessions Med school. Urban. Diverse. Change. Decentralized. Silos. Growing. In-person response from listening sessions Medical center centric In-person response from listening sessions Medical center overshadows all other areas In-person response from listening sessions Medical school In-person response from listening sessions Medical school gets what it wants and everyone else divides what is left over In-person response from listening sessions Middle managers who try to protect their job and territory and back things up In-person response from listening sessions Mission - to train college eligible students in Alabama. Very real conflict between remaining true to this mission and becoming a truly outstanding university. In-person response from listening sessions Mission seems to be to grow student not improve quality In-person response from listening sessions Momentum In-person response from listening sessions Momentum. In-person response from listening sessions More and better physical facilities In-person response from listening sessions More bike lanes to encourage interaction In-person response from listening sessions More conflict that has caused wasted opportunities In-person response from listening sessions More emphasis on non-medical side of campus In-person response from listening sessions More of a commuter school In-person response from listening sessions More positive partner with community In-person response from listening sessions More traditional look because of green spaces In-person response from listening sessions Most people think of UAB as medical school. Even if you are undergraduate you must be in premed or predent In-person response from listening sessions Multidisciplinary In-person response from listening sessions My brother when he comes to BHM can't believe the growth, the cranes, the construction. Don't know what BHM would be without the growth of UAB. In-person response from listening sessions My impression is that it's a busy place. Lot of opportunity for students to get involved. Hard to get a parking place. In-person response from listening sessions My major is also public health. I have friends who were bio or chem majors and they had trouble finding applications for their majors. Public health offers great hands-on experiences and how it applies. Others are struggling to see how bio or chem can fit into real life and jobs, etc. Need to have more practical insight into their majors\/usefulness of our majors. In-person response from listening sessions My major is public health with both faculty and material. A lot of my friends go on to graduate school. You learn so much as an Undergraduate that you can easily go on to graduate school without problem. In-person response from listening sessions Need more professional staff In-person response from listening sessions Need more research in archives of Civil Rights Institute. In-person response from listening sessions Need more revenue In-person response from listening sessions Need more streamlined business processes In-person response from listening sessions Need more work on big data and library needs to be center of that effort In-person response from listening sessions Need talking points so we are all on same page In-person response from listening sessions Need to be able to use UA library In-person response from listening sessions Need to emphasize undergraduate education more. In-person response from listening sessions New technologies roll out every day In-person response from listening sessions No contact between administration, support staff, and faculty - neither know what the other does or is doing In-person response from listening sessions No longer thought of as a commuter college. In-person response from listening sessions No one ever comes around to see how things are going In-person response from listening sessions No one uses the UAB Bus System. Expand and help students get to connect to City. IDEA: it's never on my mind to use it. Signs to have it on people's minds. In-person response from listening sessions Nobody uses buses. Need to completely reevaluate on campus transportation - talk to bus drivers they know what are the problems In-person response from listening sessions Not a destination university In-person response from listening sessions Not as much emphasis on \"green\" as needs to be. In-person response from listening sessions Not doing a good job on recruitment of faculty or students In-person response from listening sessions Not getting learning \"out to the neighborhoods\" the way we should. Need to have more emphasis on service learning. In-person response from listening sessions Not really honest with what we count in Capital Campaign In-person response from listening sessions Not recruiting first rate faculty and students In-person response from listening sessions Not student centered In-person response from listening sessions Not sure it is our goal to become a first-rate institution In-person response from listening sessions Not very good at interacting with City. In-person response from listening sessions Not wearing our colors\/shirts\/swag. In-person response from listening sessions Not well branded In-person response from listening sessions Nothing happens when recommendations are made In-person response from listening sessions Now we are 10 years behind our competition - we should catch up In-person response from listening sessions On the move In-person response from listening sessions One big university but not there yet In-person response from listening sessions One size fits all mindset In-person response from listening sessions Only hope for national attention is in athletics In-person response from listening sessions Only time Alumni Association contacts us is to ask for $$$. In-person response from listening sessions Opportunity to develop In-person response from listening sessions Over the past 10-15 years - good job of re-branding the university to be more a traditional urban campus. Prominent structures facing the interstate so that you're welcome to campus - for new student orientation and football growth good. If they continue with a lot of green space, that fosters community. In-person response from listening sessions People don't know that UAB also offers other curricula than pre-med, pre-health. In-person response from listening sessions People don't see us as a comprehensive university In-person response from listening sessions People don't understand where we are and where we are going In-person response from listening sessions People get it done even when they lack resources In-person response from listening sessions People still do things without funding In-person response from listening sessions People think that I'm talking about Tuscaloosa rather than UAB. It's really hard to say, no, no. You're thinking of a different location. In-person response from listening sessions Perceived economy at UAB exists, i.e. Dominant Health Center vs. Undergraduate \"side\" In-person response from listening sessions Places to store long boards In-person response from listening sessions Poor teaching facilities In-person response from listening sessions Possible to build on personal and professional strengths In-person response from listening sessions Potential In-person response from listening sessions Progressive - New student center, business school, facilities In-person response from listening sessions Progressive Health care In-person response from listening sessions Progressive healthcare. Urban institution. Diversity. Research. Growing. Largest employer in the state of Alabama. In-person response from listening sessions Quality of student body is abysmal and getting worse. Essential open enrollment. In-person response from listening sessions QUESTION: Is UAB a place where exciting things are going to happen as opposed to falling into a funk? ANSWER: Not at all - it's cutting edge. In-person response from listening sessions QUESTION: What about people outside the UAB family? ANSWER: I think we're still seen as the little sister to UA the commuter school or the medical school alone. I know how awesome it is, but don't think In-person response from listening sessions Raising national profile In-person response from listening sessions Really great example of the public\/private partnerships - entrepreneurialism like Innovation Depot, other spin-offs for economic impact. Attracting more companies, more people (talent). In-person response from listening sessions Research In-person response from listening sessions Rigid policies and procedures In-person response from listening sessions Risk averse at all levels In-person response from listening sessions Same for nursing. More excitement than ever before. Ready to see how it impacts the nursing students and healthcare and how they learn and apply those things practically. In-person response from listening sessions School to school decentralization. E.g. a student caught cheating - not all schools have a way of knowing what's going on. Differences in how these things are handled. Mandating of reporting so that all schools are aware of these students. In-person response from listening sessions Seems to be visionary at top and ambitious at the worker level but big roadblocks at the middle bureaucracy In-person response from listening sessions Slowly becoming known as more than medical school In-person response from listening sessions Smart folks work here - students\/staff\/faculty In-person response from listening sessions Snappy and flexible In-person response from listening sessions SOB - We're known as Medical School. But our younger alumni are feeling a part of a comprehensive university and being know for something other than just medicine. Our Alumni, with the new building, their degree is rising in esteem compared to other universities. The groundbreaking of the CSOB has created even more interest and excitement in the school and feeling part of the larger campus. Facilitate more open conversations\/cross-collaborations. Alumns want class sizes to stay small. Professor interactions is still very importatnt. In-person response from listening sessions Some deans have clear vision others do not In-person response from listening sessions Some genie somewhere might know were money comes from and goes but no one else does In-person response from listening sessions Some special things here - collaboration In-person response from listening sessions Sometimes important aspects are overwhelmed by traffic, parking, etc. In-person response from listening sessions Sometimes it feels like people who work at UAB and those that don't work at UAB - them and us divide. If you are here you feel that connection. If you're not here maybe you feel resentment? Hospital side seems happy with their lot. Campus side perhaps not to the same degree. In-person response from listening sessions Sometimes procedures are not well thought through In-person response from listening sessions SON - Many are surprised how large the campus is now. We're making a bigger footprint in BHM, State, Nation. Tech boom. What they're discovering (healthcare setting, etc.). The more than 100 city blocks is impressive. Even local alumni? In-person response from listening sessions Stadium should be on campus In-person response from listening sessions Staff feels second class In-person response from listening sessions Staff resents faculty In-person response from listening sessions Stepping stone; need to invest to keep the people we have In-person response from listening sessions Still dominated by the medical center In-person response from listening sessions Still rising - lack of disciplinary barriers. In-person response from listening sessions Still rising vibrant institution. Biggest plus is the lack of disciplinary boundaries between departments. No silos. Known for our collaboration across disciplines\/departments. That lack of ability to interact across departmental boundaries is typicsl of universities like UAB, but not the case here. Comprehensive university, part of which is kind of emphasizing more of the undergraduate end of campus. Storng depts. in liberal arts and sciences. We're seen as pre-med and medical school. Need to change the messaging that arts and other fields are available and strong. Philosophy for example. Psychology as well. We have a strong Honors presence and that's important to our state university recruitment\/retention efforts. Need to lift other departments. In-person response from listening sessions Still seen as a \"medical school' and a \"commuter school\" In-person response from listening sessions Still uncomfortable in relationship with BOT In-person response from listening sessions Strong Honors College - attracts better students. In-person response from listening sessions Structure and vision incompatible In-person response from listening sessions Student friendly In-person response from listening sessions Students not aware of how to go about and who to go to with good ideas. In-person response from listening sessions Students not high quality In-person response from listening sessions Students say how surprised they are with what's going on. Once you get here - you get to learn what's going on. But we need to highlight all the great things that are going on. Keep these informational campaigns going across the state. In-person response from listening sessions Support level that actually makes things easier not harder In-person response from listening sessions Surprised at how large the campus is In-person response from listening sessions System under stress In-person response from listening sessions Teamwork cooperation In-person response from listening sessions Teamwork is good In-person response from listening sessions Tech investments have been great. Solar panels have been great. Green roofs could be good. All cities should be having a green direction. UAB could instigate with the city. Those were good choices. In-person response from listening sessions Tentative In-person response from listening sessions The facility is so nice and it's a one-stop shop for all services without having to drive from one office to another. It's efficient. But have heard for mental health it can be a wait. For run of the mill illnesses, everything is on-campus - even the PT is set up as needed for students at the rec center. In-person response from listening sessions There are some parallels between UAB and the University of Houston. UH went through this several years ago. In-person response from listening sessions They fear that it's unsafe because it's near the city. If you're rural, then you fear the big city. But it's really not that way. Change that perception. In-person response from listening sessions This is the way things have always been done In-person response from listening sessions This side\/that side of campus In-person response from listening sessions Thought of as unsafe - some people fear going to school in a big city In-person response from listening sessions Tied to Birmingham In-person response from listening sessions Too bureaucratic and centralized In-person response from listening sessions Too many boundaries - more territorial than ever In-person response from listening sessions Too many naysayers In-person response from listening sessions Too many silos In-person response from listening sessions Too much duplication of services and programs across campus In-person response from listening sessions Too much paperwork and too much bureaucracy In-person response from listening sessions Too much pressure to increase enrollment In-person response from listening sessions Too much promotion of off-campus activities. Nothing to do on week-ends In-person response from listening sessions Tools to be the face of Birmingham; need to focus efforts to realize that possibility In-person response from listening sessions Top heavy with administrators and support staff for high level administrators In-person response from listening sessions Top tier research university In-person response from listening sessions Transitional\u2014moving towards becoming a more traditional campus In-person response from listening sessions Trying to be everything to everybody In-person response from listening sessions UAB = medical center not much about other areas is known In-person response from listening sessions UAB also has ASC - kind of more a public face to BHM as far as culture goes. Something you can hang your hat on. Not just research or the hospital or the school. In-person response from listening sessions UAB and city are working as well together now as they ever have. City govmt and business leaders working well. We're on the forefront of those partnerships and it's exciting. In-person response from listening sessions UAB and City working together better than ever before In-person response from listening sessions UAB as the University that Ate Birmingham. Our international students are bringing all kinds of diversity. Our city is diverse. We have the opportunity to reach out to the city and influence how the city changes over time. In-person response from listening sessions UAB has harmed local neighborhoods In-person response from listening sessions UAB has historically been in the shadow of UA and AUB, but if you're looking at it from the 18 year old perspective - uab isn't the first place to look. Maybe there's some other things we could do - restaurant and bar scene could be better for example to have the traditional experience. Perception is that UAB isn't the same. In-person response from listening sessions UAB is a 2nd tier school. In-person response from listening sessions UAB is a destination site for graduate students yet kids with 36 ACT scores are not talking about UAB as a destination. In-person response from listening sessions UAB is confused about what it wants to be particularly in research In-person response from listening sessions UAB is overly responsive to regulatory actions. Being responsible and being overly responsive is different. UAB over-reacts and gets in the way of research, it is a barrier to researchers who are trying to do the right thing; sometimes it stymies research. In-person response from listening sessions UAB is really diverse, but are we that unified around things? Many student organizations, but not overlap or coordination across groups. In-person response from listening sessions UAB took over the role of US Steel. Everyone in the metro region understands that and appreciates it. Maybe for the first time since our existence. In-person response from listening sessions Uncertainty - buildings in very bad shape In-person response from listening sessions Uncertainty over new budget model In-person response from listening sessions Under rated and unknown In-person response from listening sessions Underappreciated and underinvested on the CAS side of campus In-person response from listening sessions Undergoing construction In-person response from listening sessions Underrated\/under valued In-person response from listening sessions Underutilized and under-rated In-person response from listening sessions Unique programs In-person response from listening sessions Unites are stretched to deal with student increases In-person response from listening sessions University not very transparent In-person response from listening sessions University trying to be all things to all people In-person response from listening sessions Up and coming In-person response from listening sessions Up and coming In-person response from listening sessions Up and coming, but aren't we really there? Holding back. In-person response from listening sessions Upper administration just doesn't get the reality of what faculty do. In-person response from listening sessions Urban In-person response from listening sessions Urban In-person response from listening sessions Urban location and urban nature In-person response from listening sessions Value health care but out of balance with remainder of campus In-person response from listening sessions VCU had a similar background with their medical\/health colleges. Those docs who had wanted no part of VCU, but it does phase out generationally. In-person response from listening sessions Very bureaucratic university In-person response from listening sessions Very high morale among existing students but perceptions among prospective students still not reflective of the reality of UAB. In-person response from listening sessions Very wide range of students - all the way from people who shouldn't be here to students who could go anywhere. In-person response from listening sessions Vibrant environment In-person response from listening sessions We ae tired of doing work arounds - just give up In-person response from listening sessions We are a research university - we should say so. In-person response from listening sessions We are lacking a sense of unity across the campus. We appear to still be two separate entity. And even in each side there are silos and little evidence of cooperation. In-person response from listening sessions We at UAB have a worse impression of UAB than those from outside. Do we fully appreciate how good we are? Not to be arrogant, but we are almost too self-deprecating. That's a definite culture shift. In-person response from listening sessions We attract students back to get serious In-person response from listening sessions We can do things other universities can't do because of our youth In-person response from listening sessions We do a good job partnering with local businesses\/restaurants. In-person response from listening sessions We don't fully engage 70% of our faculty to work as a comprehensive university In-person response from listening sessions We don't have a rival - like UA has AUB as a rival. Not a bad thing, per se. Just an observation. In-person response from listening sessions We have students on campus with ideas about how to improve the campus, but they don't know who to contact. Need a clear channel of communication to listen to ideas. - could do our own solution studios for UAB. In-person response from listening sessions We have taken a leadership role in this region. In-person response from listening sessions WE mean more to our students. Research in NYT among social mobility - UAB students have social mobility more than students at other schools within\/without the state. Need to convey who our students are and how we impact them. In-person response from listening sessions We need to get into the 21st Century In-person response from listening sessions We never decide what we are - everything to everyone In-person response from listening sessions We realize we cannot outpace the time it takes to build these things. Or the financial fundraising. In-person response from listening sessions WE say we're all about students, but we don't cater to students. We cater to faculty\/hospital\/administration. This is feedback from students. In-person response from listening sessions We should act like the largest single employer in the state and be world-class. In-person response from listening sessions We're known for our diversity and should really be proud of it. Self-selection of undergraduate students who want that environment. Expanding horizons. Huge positive. In-person response from listening sessions We're more of a destination university rather than a \"back-up\" In-person response from listening sessions We're such a large campus and because we're in BHM. It's complex. It's too much going on. Being unified as a way to bring us together. Communication unification. In-person response from listening sessions Weak communication In-person response from listening sessions Weekends there's nothing going on. Promoting engagement of commuter students. Bike infrastructure would really help with that. That increases social interaction, etc. Brings that sense of community. In-person response from listening sessions Well kept secret. In-person response from listening sessions Well known for medical area In-person response from listening sessions What do we want to be? In-person response from listening sessions What does the upper level leadership actually do (VP for Research as example) and is leadership being evaluated? Is there accountability? In-person response from listening sessions What kind of changes? - All areas! If I had to apply now, I wouldn't get in. In-person response from listening sessions When we try to move positively no one cares In-person response from listening sessions Willingness to change In-person response from listening sessions Working to get to where the medical center is In-person response from listening sessions Would like less emphasis on online classes - need direct engagement (face-to-face) with faculty. In-person response from listening sessions Yes we have the urban campus, but we also have satellites all over the city - medical complexes throughout BHM. In-person response from listening sessions Question 2: What is your vision for UAB in 2021? Answer Affiliation More inclusion of minorities and become more outspoken in the support of minorities and in the enriching of the diversity environment in all it's aspects. Online: Faculty Completion of a new outpatient clinic building to replace TKC. Relocation of select resources to the TKC building. Construction of additional operating rooms at the main UAB Hospital. Online: Faculty Would like to see UAB is a leader organization not only in Alabama but USA, in other areas that had not been focused Online: Faculty If UAB continues on its current path, we will likely settle out as a large clinical institution that focuses on regional tertiary specialty care and industry-funded clinical trials with a continuing decline in NIH program and R01 funding and innovation. Online: Faculty UAB has invested a great deal in the undergraduate and graduate facilities and experience over the past 10 years (Hill Center, dorms, Rec Center ...etc.), but the clinical, clinical education, and biomedical research facilities have suffered greatly from a lack of maintenance, timely renovations, and investment. Online: Faculty UAB will be an exciting university - you can feel the energy on campus among students and faculty - that attracts top faculty and students, that meets metrics to be a Top 20 Public University with a Top 20 Medical School, and that receives national attention as THE up-and-coming public university in the nation. Online: Faculty My vision for UAB is that there is an increased focus on interdisciplinary research and equity across schools. The fact that the School of Ed annually receives $50,000 for doctoral fellowships (granted they must participate in full-time research, so this is moot in my understanding) whereas medicine is given $3.6 million tells me that I am worth much less and my contributions are less than. Online: Faculty A more positive community of people sincerely dedicated to making a difference in the lives of others through leadership in education, discovery, and service Online: Faculty Continued progress towards becoming the \"Flagship\" of the UA system. I think this will happen naturally as a result of academic success on the part of our students and graduates, which in turn will result in continued growth. Online: Faculty I would like to UAB as a leader in acceptance, not just diversity, an academic leader for more disciplines, and for improved benefits for employees (particularly equitable salaries for healthcare providers working on the academic side, compared with the hospital\/medical side). Online: Faculty Depends on how #1 is addressed or handled. It could be great and set examples for other universities. Online: Faculty I would have liked to see UAB try to become an elite institution, letting Tuscaloosa focus on the mass market. But I guess the decision to grow at the expense of quality has been made, and that's that. Online: Faculty (1) Continue to improve research at UAB at all of the schools through targeted investment. (2) Increase diversity awareness and application. (3) Provide additional professional assistance to the schools to improve philanthropy support. Online: Faculty Eliminate that which is bad so that which is good can florish Online: Faculty quality, affordable education; outstanding medical enterprise; vibrant research enterprise; a desired place to work (many work for the state for the benefits, there needs to be more than that); sense of common purpose Online: Faculty I want UAB to be seen as a leader in research. Particularly in the area of health disparities. I want us to be seen as the place to go to see state of the art community engagement and participatory research. I want an environment of inclusivesness that is evident from staff to undergraduate to graduate to faculty. Online: Faculty An improved approach to supporting and funding students, staff, and faculty. In turn, they will make the university shine brighter than ever before. Online: Faculty As a new investigator who is engaged in adherence research, I would like to see a coordinated, university-wide effort toward establishing a multidisciplinary program in chronic disease adherence and self-management. Currently, several groups on campus are engaged in such research in their respective disease areas (e.g., HIV, cancer, CF). Despite important intersections, however, there isn't sufficient interaction between groups. A robust research on adherence and self-management requires theoretical, methodological, and content expertise in clinical, social, and behavioral science. A university-wide interdisciplinary research center (or similar infrastructure) will allow investigators to streamline resources, data, research skills and competencies, theoretical approaches, and content expertise and complement each other's research efforts for maximized output and growth. I believe that we are on the way of reaching a critical mass of investigators interested in adherence research and are thus well-positioned to take the next step. Formalizing research on adherence and self-management in chronic disease and providing institutional support for this cross-cutting area will put UAB on the national map of innovative, ground-breaking, comprehensive adherence research. We can test and implement theory-based approaches that incorporate social and clinical data to provide comprehensive, technology-based psychosocial support to patients with chronic disease. Such approaches enable patients to manage better their chronic condition and improve their health outcomes, quality of life, and communication with the healthcare team. Importantly, we can expect to see increased effectiveness of the clinical encounter and reduced healthcare costs as a result of decreased hospitalizations. Online: Faculty UAB in 2021 should be a leader in research and education. Importantly, this should not be focused solely in the medical\/health professions. UAB should also continue to be a strong, vibrant leader in the Arts & Sciences. Online: Faculty Fostering a culture of mentoring, to help employees and students to grow in their roles. The concept of mentoring needs to be prevalent throughout the campus, and specifically mentioned in the mission, values and strategic plan. Online: Faculty That the University would once again offer these Higher Education degree programs Online: Faculty I love the new direction that UAB is growing into, and love the open spaces that are green. My hope is that ALL the UAB current buildings receive the upgrades necessary - to include large space accessible for power wheelchair users and open space parking throughout campus areas - access to buildings through the front door via ramps - and safety around the buildings 24\/7. Online: Faculty Excellence in all facets of education, patient care, research, facilities, campus beautification and attitude and accountability of employees. Online: Faculty I expect it grow same pace. Online: Faculty Great all-comprehensive university. Online: Faculty A University that is successful in Education, Research and Community service including health care delivery. Online: Faculty, Alumnus I really think it is important for UAB to have better child care options for students, faculty, and staff. Imagine what UAB would look like as a world leader in supporting families by having better child care options. As it is now, there is no on-site day care, and the existing facility is extremely limited in the number of children it can accept as well in the hours of care offered. For a university and hospital that operates around the clock and all days of the year, UAB could do a much better job. Online: Faculty, Alumnus, Community member To have student body larger than 25,000 and a diverse faulty group with more leadership from different races and ethncity present in each schools\/unit administration. Online: Faculty, Alumnus, Community member To have the university expand in interprofessional models of care and education Online: Faculty, Community member To improve the quality of life for the residents that live in this city called Birmingham and Jefferson County. To help eliminate racial poverty in this city and county. To help create city resident owned Black business entities first and then spread the opportunity outward.. Online: Faculty, Community member UAB can continue to advance if we can continue to bring in more and more resources through the capital campaign and other development initiatives, as well as sponsored research. Online: Faculty, Parent, Community member I see a lot of potential in UAB, the talent here is great and everyone is dedicated to the same cause. I just hope it can be even more known outside of its particular fields as a world class university by upgrading its facilities and management of cleaning staff. Online: Faculty, Staff world class organization across all core groups. We have some pockets of excellence and mediocrity across the organization. We need to resource or hold accountable those pockets of mediocrity as appropriate. Online: Faculty, Staff To be the leading receiver of NIH grants in the country. Online: Faculty, Staff, Community member I do not see this feature on the master plan. Maybe I missed it. I am wondering if the second floor main concourse is to be extended from Spain across 7th Ave. to Lister Hill. Then students and faculty could walk from the Nursing and Public Health Schools across University to the main parts of the hospital safely and easily. Online: Staff My vision for UAB in 2021 is that UAB recognizes, includes and understands outlying programs within UAB, such as the Department of Psychiatry's (School of Medicine) Juvenile and Adult TASC programs. UAB has a wealth of knowledge and resources to help TASC in working with people within the adult and juvenile justice populations. Online: Staff A fully developed student experience with the ability to get meaningful experiences to prepare students for the workforce or graduate school. Online: Staff More interactive technology and touch screen equipment. Transition more into a green hospital. Online: Staff I would like to see UAB become stronger with the care and support that is given on an outpt basis, support service lines and patients across the continuum of care, improve our informatics programs and grow our tele health programs Online: Staff I envision a place without silos. A place of information sharing and everyone working together to create a culture of excellence. I envision a healthcare organization performing in the top 5% of all academic medical centers in services we offer. I envision a place known for retention of staff and recruitment of new talent. Online: Staff My visions for UAB in 2021 would be the continued growth in research development that will impact the Nation. Online: Staff I seek to have greater independence of Advanced Practice Providers where they function to the top of license. I see that as as key point in becoming the preferred AMC for the 21st century. I would also like to see UAB be THE source for ongoing education and training for APPs in our region. Online: Staff More numerous and meaningful developments in terms of authentic integration of people with differing perspectives across many subject areas. Too, salaries more in line with schools of similar make up and size. Online: Staff Conversations about diversity, equity and inclusion will reflect the great strides that have been made that others will seek to follow. Online: Staff More support to the optometry Program. Online: Staff Progressive policies for wellness, sustainability, flexibility and remuneration. Online: Staff Greater NIH Dollars Online: Staff Great leadership in all areas Online: Staff I want to see UAB rise in the ranks of AMCs Online: Staff To continue being a diverse organization and working toward common goals. Online: Staff To be the preferred hospital in the nation. Online: Staff I plan to retire in 2021 and would like to leave the organization knowing that we continue to be an inclusive and forward thinking organization Online: Staff Focus on extreme high quality patient care--slow down building expansion and input dollars into increasing quality\/technology and engaging staff at the current levels. Online: Staff AMC 21 is the ideal goal for this institution. Getting there is a challenge, yet very possible. Online: Staff haven't really thought about this Online: Staff More visibility in how programs are promoting diversity. Online: Staff I would like to see UAB run efficiently. Low performers need to be removed. With the large volume increases every year there is no room for those employees that refuse to meet those demands. Online: Staff My vision would be for UAB to continue to coordinate its efforts in united the campus and health system. To quote my spouse, UAB is the Ivy league for ordinary people. I think this is a compliment. In history ordinary people have made tremendous advancements. Online: Staff A more organized synergistic place of Academics and Healthcare, with the ability to excel even more beyond the State of Alabama and beyond the South. Online: Staff One IT system (or one front-end system to the user); a private business employee culture of exceptional, rather than a government employee culture of adequate Online: Staff Sustained patient care quality and top 10 research facilities. Online: Staff 1) Improve quality and decrease LOS. Let quality improvement drive our cost reduction initiatives. Perhaps adopt the Toyota production system into our thinking. 2) Reduce nursing turnover- perhaps look at Emory where they start RNs at $24\/hour, but at year three, they jump to $30\/hour by participating on committees, national certification etc. Make bedside nursing appealing and not feel that they have to leave the bedside. Online: Staff To invest more in its employees. The removal of teachers retirement creates a massive gap in total lifetime compensation between the new generation of employees and those who have been here for quite a while. This will hinder employee retention in the future. Online: Staff In 2021 I hope to still be apart of UAB and making a greater impact on the UAB Community. So more opportunities to grow. Online: Staff Increased student enrollment within all the schools, emphasis on highlighting major academic\/research accomplishments within our faculty, and reconnecting the goals of the schools with that of the central administration. Online: Staff I hope there are a few more parking decks. Faculty and Staff parking separate from student parking. Staff\/faculty only lounges, not just break rooms, lounges. Maybe separate eating times at the commons for staff and faculty and students. We need that separation time. Or separate eating areas would be easier. Online: Staff To continue to push research boundaries and grow as an internationally-recognized university. Online: Staff to grow and continue to strive for being the best Online: Staff New building to replace Campbell Hall with more space for teaching and research included Online: Staff I envision a university that provides accessible academic support services to all students. The university uses its resources to become renowned for both its undergraduate and graduate programs. Online: Staff Greater governance of principles and confidentiality within HR, developing staff and building 'partnerships' between staff and faculty, instead of hierarchy. Implementation of a 360 degree evaluation for all staff (including faculty in staff roles or vice versa) that ties back to merit increases. Online: Staff excellence Online: Staff Flex-time opportunities for staff. Online: Staff For 2021, I see UAB remaining a powerhouse in higher education and medical care. I see a shared governance between faculty, students and staff in which all have an equal voice in decisions. With the creation of the UAB Staff Council, I see a shift towards a shared governance, but hope that continues and is stronger in 2021. Online: Staff Adequate classrooms and lab space for students. Parking available for students and staff. Professional development and promoting from within for staff. Being valued for my contribution to the institution. Online: Staff To be an inclusive community where students, staff and faculty can realize their potential. To become a true learning organization. In addition to the four pillars, we need a clearly defined people strategy to ensure every member of our community know they are valued and are given the opportunity to learn and grow. Online: Staff I would like UAB to focus not only on its students, but also on its staff. There are many moving parts that keep this train moving. I also feel that it's important to continue fostering a sense of community across campus. Online: Staff My vision for the 2021 UAB centers on technology development. It should be a leader in online programs and have a strong media presence. It remains one of the top research universities but is also one of the top online universities. Online: Staff UAB will become the leading academic institution in Alabama and the southeast. Online: Staff N\/A Online: Staff See above and below. Online: Staff Please add a Culture of Safety. UAB has yet to be in the news for research or other health\/safety violations and\/or issues. I'd like to see that UAB maintains that record. Online: Staff Renowned in all aspects. Safety of all is at the forefront. Culture of Safety is imbedded in staff, students, faculty, etc. Online: Staff Multi-level parking decks. Online: Staff Common green areas with trees and landscaping. ...... Side sections of sidewalks opened up so that trees can be planted. It should be relaxing and enjoyable to walk around campus. Less thru traffic - bike friendly .Clear defined building names that are eye level Online: Staff Equipment maintenance and upgrades Online: Staff a culture of safety change to protect our intellectual investment - students. A culture of safety change to make the UAB campus a safe and healthy place to grow, do research and serve the surrounding population. Online: Staff Emphasize the educational excellence of the UAB offerings by attracting (and retaining) International students. These types of students, and their parents, will probably be more attracted by UAB's commitment to education rather than national football championships. Online: Staff improved patient relations.. they should feel valued? with lesser wait times for appts, lesser wait times for responses, being treated like royalty instead of the way the employees are treated Online: Staff UAB would be considered a top choice for education and health care in Alabama and across the country. UAB would also have an international footprint. UAB would be recognized by those in the community and across the state as a top choice for education and not seen as a secondary choice to other institutions across the state. I believe that UAB already is those things, but the public is not always aware of all of the accomplishments of UAB as an academic institution despite UAB's efforts to publicize these accomplishments. This is more than likely due to historical perception and the impact of collegiate sports in name recognition. However, I think it is necessary to overcome that perception in order to make UAB the top academic choice in the state. Online: Staff I'd like to see UAB more integrated - true enterprise solutions that include faculty, staff and students as well as incorporating both the medical and campus side of things. I'd like to see UAB IT and HSIS as one, streamless faculty\/staff\/student onboarding, better mentoring\/training programs for faculty\/staff so that they can learn from others, standard SOPs and clear policies\/procedures. I'd also like to see someone at UAB who can make decisions that are for the good of the university as a whole. Online: Staff Traffic routed around or below UAB. Service tunnels underground, instead of digging up streets to put in a chiller line, electrical service, etc.. dig it once. A monorail system connecting buildings and parking satellite stations, to facilitate movement of students and employees. Online: Staff I'd like to see us have a clearly defined identity as an institution. I think I've head about a strategic plan for almost 5 years. I'd like to see it articulated and know that employees are aware of this plan and serve as ambassadors for helping to achieve these goals. I'd like to see employees invested in the vision and plan for this institution. I'd like to see us behaving as a mature institution and own who we are. Online: Staff Organization around the growth. Better communication between all groups Online: Staff 15% - 20% growth in enrollments. More space for research work. More on campus living space for more students. Online: Staff Undo what the new management has messed up and do things the old way, the right way Online: Staff Continue the movement of having a multi cultural campus which provides an academic opportunities. UAB should also encourage a more collegiate atmosphere. When I say collegiate I mean unity supporting all athletic and academic programs. This provides the multi cultural student body an opportunity to interact and feel a sense of unity and pride for the university. This pride may in turn develop alumni that are willing to make donations to support university programs. Online: Staff 75% degree programs available online or blended; college of online\/blended studies that is responsible for managing all programs and courses at UAB Online: Staff Continued enrollment growth. Improved national rankings. Aggressively grow research initiatives. Be known as the public institution for research in the southeast. . Embrace location within a city (don't change it, integrate within in it). Densify the campus (build on what we have) Online: Staff New building for HIV\/AIDS patients will full ancillary clinics i.e. GI, Derm, Psych\/Mental Health, Infusion, Cancer, Radiology, labs, etc Online: Staff Large as or larger than Texas Medical Center in Houston. Online: Staff For UAB to establish its healthcare system across the state with as many hospitals\/clinics as possible. Online: Staff, Alumnus I would like to see the campus become a green campus, meaning a majority of the building might be off the grid or supported by renewable energy. Online: Staff, Alumnus A University wide mentoring\/coaching program where everyone at UAB can participate in mentoring so that we build a community that understands and fosters the idea that our greatest resources are our people and if we all work together we can do great things. Online: Staff, Alumnus Growth as an academic medical center, strengthen reputation as a national leader. Online: Staff, Alumnus, Community member I would like to see a new vision for employee parking. Maybe decks around the campus\/Medical Center perimeter, with primarily pedestrian access to the core buildings. Having to travel long distances to many buildings, I sometimes feel like I take my life in my hands crossing the streets. I would also like to see more outlying clinics. It's so difficult for many people to drive downtown, the actually walk to their destination. Online: Staff, Alumnus, Community member I would like to see it become known not only as a great university for medical education and but also as a great university for any other type of educational pursuits a student may have. Online: Staff, Alumnus, Parent 1) A greater focus on providing an amazing experience for the students, employees, and community members. 2) A greater focus on cross departmental connections and campus unity. 3) Reduction of redundant departments and jobs through use of electronic services. 4) Increase funding for marketing of all B'ham area and university events to students and staff with a new UAB app or other modern marketing tool. 5) More 'in-step' marketing for all UAB events \/calendar entry required. To avoid duplication and reduce unknown conflicts. 6) Blazer fun bucks: Each new freshmen gets a starting balance in their 'new' entertainment account. Enlarged Marketing team works with local business and UAB departments to accept these or donate this as marketing. 7) Bring the Campus Recreation Center back to being run by real UAB employees. 8) Provide health insurance premium reductions to all employees that participate in specific activities, like being a member of the Rec and attending regularly. 9) Move over night parking to secure parking off campus. (Students that live on campus and park their cars for many days at a time could park them further away.) Online: Staff, Alumnus, Parent, Community member Good but Not enough room for growth Online: Staff, Parent The future of UAB is involvement. Investing in these organizations that promote diversity. Having more events on the green during the school year not just at the beginning. More student input on what they want. Online: Student Have more parking for students. Online: Student I envision UAB as being a more green and beautified campus than it already is. I also wish to see more new and beautiful buildings to enhance the modern feel of the campus. Online: Student I would love to see the social sciences expanded, particularly in the fields of anthropology, sociology, and social work. The new masters program in anthropology is exciting, and I would hope that it will continue to evolve into a PHD program. The faculty and staff of that department are scholastic giants, and they are wonderful people. Online: Student No comment. Online: Student Better parking. Online: Student I don't care because I'll be gone. Online: Student That they invest in infrastructure and parking. Online: Student Better bus system Online: Student Nothing, it's great Online: Student I will not be at UAB in 2021 Online: Student Faculty plans curriculum together. Less repeated material. Faculty that are more capable of teaching (better presentations and organization). Happier students who talk with pride about UAB. Online: Student More parking Online: Student A parking place for everyone! Online: Student Don't care. Will be gone Online: Student As UAB has boasted about it's claims of diversity and inclusiveness. I think leadership should thoroughly be vetted to ensure they are genuinely on board with the mission of equity, diversity and inclusion. More importantly, the actions of the person, and not the eloquence of the message they are sending should be more heavily weighted. The people that are directly impacted by the lack of diversity and inclusion are aware when people are more about the talk then the walk and it alienates that population of the academic population even more. Online: Student More involvement between the disciplines especially within the medical programs Online: Student UAB will no longer have a football program in 2021 because our team will have failed, again, and funding will have dried up, again, and the whole thing will have been a huge exercise in futility. UAB's strengths are not in athletics and while it is still encouraged to support those endeavours, wasting money to try and compete with schools that pay coaches millions of dollars (in a state where people already have their football fix) is a total sunk cost. Online: Student Hopefully I will see the name on a piece a paper with my name and degree. Online: Student I would like to see the campus become a green campus, meaning a majority of the building might be off the grid or supported by renewable energy. Online: Student The most green, tech-savvy, modern campus in the south. Online: Student Diverse Online: Student More parking Online: Student Updating the buildings with new technology mainly. Online: Student I will not be here in 2021, however, I would like to see the professors typically care a little more. Being a science major, I know many of my classes have large numbers and it is hard to have a one on one relationship with professors, but it is very beneficial to my education. Meetings with professors help me get a real handle on the material. However, when I do go talk to professors and they don't seem to really care about my education, it can be very discouraging, and it makes it hard for me to care about the class. Online: Student Hopefully instead of building random building every block and avoiding the main problem at hand, UAB could look towards turning its ever problematic parking situation by building decks in place of parking lots. UAB keeps taking away parking lots and parking spaces and telling students to park 20 miles away from their nearest classroom. Online: Student More parking and dorms, everything else is great Online: Student Expand campus outward. Online: Student More coffee places please and food places. The lines can get really bad around lunch. Online: Student In 2021, I would like for students to feel safe walking at night on campus. Blue help buttons, as nice as they are in theory, really only help you after you've been robbed. Secondly, if UAB parking could stop sending us emailing congratulating themselves on \"adding\" parking, that would be great. Students do not dislike off-campus lots because we are lazy, we dislike them because they are unsecure, and the bus system is inconvenient. Also, when UAB reserves the Hoehn parking lot with orange cones for people who are evidently more important than the students who pay administrators' salaries, that's a big kick in the nuts. Online: Student I really hope that UAB will be on the map as a lively, sociable, fun, and highly intelligent school! Everyone knows UAB is perfect for anything in the medical field, but now it is time to market some campus and student life activities for even more appeal. Something that I think a majority of students would love to have on campus is a Chick fil a!!! Expanding ANYTHING on campus makes students very happy. Online: Student to reduse prices on textbooks. Online: Student N\/A Online: Student Plenty of parking available for commuter students near campus, so there isn't a 10-15 minute walk to class. As UAB grows, the need for parking will only increase, and the availability of parking makes a huge impact on student satisfaction at UAB. Ask anyone who drives. Online: Student More security, to avoid any incidents. More than anything, though, UAB needs to provide a vision of modernity and embrace the future. I would like to see more bridges over traffic to avoid any trouble in auto and foot traffic, and more than anything, I think that the Humanities building needs to be completely destroyed and rebuilt. I am aware that this is a large project, but its a safety hazard in cases of heavy weather, it is dated and brings no enjoyment of people who are primarily attending classes inside, and, lastly, it's a frightful eye-sore. The building hasn't aged well and thus looks out of place with all the modern brick buildings. Online: Student Increased leadership in key areas, including public health and medicine. A more global and more inclusive institution. Online: Student As a full time working student with 100% online classes, I would really enjoy seeing more mini semester classes offered. Especially at the senior level. Currently I can only take 1 class per semester, just because I do better focusing on 1 class at a time. If mini semesters were offered, I could double up my classes per semester, but still enjoy focusing on just one at a time. I could graduate almost a year and half earlier, which would benefit almost all working students. Online: Student I hope UAB expands its opportunities for other schools (like the school of business) that are given less attention than other schools, like CAS. I hope UAB can become a more cohesive campus with more school spirit and unity. Online: Student Research and Athletics. More space for research is always needed. It brings in money. Athletics advertises UAB. I would like to see an on-campus stadium for UAB football and soccer. Online: Student Not a vision, but this is a suggestion when considering housing expansion. A few dorm rooms dedicated to distance student housing when we are there to see your advisors, complete exams, committee meetings, and research would be extremely helpful. Current distance students pay $150.00 on up to stay in hotels close to school, if we fly in we do not have cars. Online: Student I invision a university that is very environmentally friendly, offering many vast green spaces and trees for students to take advantage of, as well as beautifully erected parking decks that allow students a vast majority of spaces to choose when it comes to the right space to put their car in. I know that some people think parking decks are not very logical, however none of the things that the planning commission have done in relation to parking has been logical. Destroying the parking lot in front of Bell theater to make a new building makes literally zero sense. Most commercial real estate deal require a specific number of parking spaces in order for the building to be complete. I would imagine that creating a facility that encourages a larger population of business students would warrant more parking opportunities. Online: Student UAB will only be as big as its freshman class. So I think new tech like AC standard WiFi and more room for on-campus housing would help drive growth for the school. But do not forget about the upperclassmen that want to live on campus. New Freshman Residence hall is nice but the removal of single living space dorms like how Denman Hall used to be is a big downside to older upperclassmen who want to live on campus but with the privacy an apartment provides. Online: Student Care more about your students! Provide good parking, reliable bus services, maintenance who actually does there job, and supervisors who will actually fire the workers who don't. The planning team should really look to The University of Alabama for ideas. I was always impressed by the way they handled their student body, whether it was parking, bus services, classroom equipment, etc. Online: Student I hope that UAB becomes a campus that is friendly to bikers and commuters. Online: Student, Alumnus I hope that UAB taps into potential to emerge as a leader in areas other than just biomedicine in 2021. For example, the unique history of Birmingham positions UAB to expand humanities and further focus on civil & human rights, economic and political social sciences, and arts. As Birmingham grows, UAB should connect with the community and engage in making the city a leader by continuing to lead and provide support for sustainable development, equitable employment policies, and thoughtful community engagement. Campus expansion should include bike and pedestrian friendly infrastructure, and overall movement toward sustainable, walkable, safe campus rather than a car-driven design. I also hope to see UAB increase the institution's public and government relations in order to better communicate all the existing and future work of UAB, which are too often kept secret. Particularly concerning scientific research, UAB would have a sizable present at the state, local, and federal policy levels. Online: Student, Alumnus, Community member I hope UAB continues to serve Birmingham area and Alabama students that may have limited access to higher ed. A commitment to providing education and opportunities to underserved must remain a value of UAB. Furthermore, academic training should include effective career and professional development opportunities for undergrad and graduate students, including service-learning, internships, mentorships, and specifically training for non-academic careers in graduate programs. Students' want to find jobs after leaving UAB, and if they are not prepared, they will not feel their education was a good investment. Online: Student, Community member UAB needs ample parking to accommodate the burgeoning student population. As it stands, parking is so hard to come by that people end up parking blocks away from the campus on the street. One of the quickest and easiest ways to better accommodate student life would be to increase parking capacity adjacent to the center campus so that students can better access all of the existing buildings and the exciting new projects underway. Online: Student, Community member I say all that to say, the business school should be able to market itself more than it does. I don't know if that's because we don't want to overshadow the Medical facilities or what, but I have seen first hand how great a group of people the business school offers us. UAB could be 30-40,000 students and still thrive, if things are done correctly. There is no reason UAB cannot be the flagship university for the state of Alabama, because Birmingham is thriving again and hopefully through continued good leadership it will continue to grow. A few things I can think of that are coming or should come is Top Golf, a new 40-50,000 seat football stadium that would be helpful not only to our football program but the city as well. State football championships could return, one day we might could attract a soccer team, the Birmingham bowl would be better then it already is. I would buy season football tickets, if the games weren't in such a rough part of town and in a football stadium operating way past its expiration date. Uptown is already thriving and Lakeview is a destination spot for adults of all ages. Birmingham should be the place people think about when they think about Alabama and ultimately UAB as well. A greater Birmingham creates a better UAB. Online: Student, Community member PARKING! FOOTBALL! PARKING!!!! Online: Student, Community member I envision a UAB of diversity. An academic and medical center of excellence where skill, education, and innovation are appreciated and valued regardless of race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, ancestry, age, veteran status or disability. Online: Student, Faculty, Staff, Alumnus, Parent, Community member UAB should have at least enough parking (close to the center of campus instead of in remote areas that causes students to be afraid to walk back to their cars on their own) for each commuter student. Online: Student, Faculty, Staff, Alumnus, Parent, Community member to be a lot more lenient with its employees. a lot of people LOVE the job, but dislike working here at UAB. Although UAB has a great name in care, do you guys take time out to see if your staff\/ employees are okay? do they even matter? or is it just about the money, and the satisfactory ratings from patients? Online: Student, Faculty, Staff, Parent, Community member More pride in the first impressions of our campus. Staff\/students\/faculty need to be more friendly and helpful to prospective student and more helpful to those students who are already here at UAB. There needs to be more attention to the UAB landscape. For example, when all the attention was going on regarding our football program, especially with Dr. Watts, I started seeing several messages\/posters all over campus stating: \"fire Ray Watts\", etc. While I believe in free speech, this in no way reflects the kind of message we want to send. More importantly, long after the \"football\" issue was resolved, the same messages posted earlier all over campus were still in place. I actually called the Office of the Provost asking if these signs regarding \"fire Ray Watts\" could be removed now that the football issue was resolved. It is unfortunate that it took several months to resolve this issue and in the meantime visitors to our campus had to view such things. Online: Student, Staff To fully support all of our students and be a leader in diversity and inclusion excellence in the state and region without fear of political backlash. Being vocal in what we are doing to advance social justice and not so afraid of owning who we are. Stop trying to be a traditional campus. Online: Student, Staff Visions for UAB is to become one the top hospitals not only in Birmingham but in the nation. Online: Student, Staff A thriving hub of research and education enhanced by the visual beauty of the campus and the surrounding regrowth of Birmingham. A university regarded as one of the best schools in the South. Every other school is considered competing with us for top tier students and researchers, much like the University of Alabama and their continued excellence in college football recruiting classes. Online: Student, Staff I plan to come back and come to grad school by then and I know I speak for everyone who is involved at UAB when I say please please please invest in parking. That is the only single complaint I have about this school and medical district. My impression of UAB would be significantly higher if we could improve on this Online: Student, Staff Underground parking where possible. All NCAA sports play \"on campus\": tennis, six court construction; football in downtown, BJCC? New, clean sidewalks. Zyp Stations all over campus (3x what there is now). Second undergraduate dining hall .A new upperclassmen residence hall Online: Student, Staff UAB needs something like Denny Chimes, something that when the public sees it, says that's UAB. Right now, UAB doesn't have anything that identifies it. Online: Student, Staff UAB Academics and UAB Medicine should be well-known nationally for its scholarly programs, patient care, professional development, and research. In terms of diversity, we need more integration between campus diversity programs, academic research programs in disparities, and with a future office of health equity. There are so many resources that can be integrated to help improve diversity on campus and in the health system. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus More commuter friendly. UAB has alienated its commuters since I started in 2011. There is hardly any parking for commuters. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus That it will become a more competitive employer. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member To be diverse and fair. To provide the highest level of education and quality patient care. To be \"one Uab\" Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member My vision - embrace and invest in collaboration among schools on campus and with other Universities. We can share resources and expertise among schools, so that students have an intensive and living learning experience. Get the English Department to have students write about life experiences they have had while working with Biology Students or Physical Therapy Students. Get Biology Students to share their world with Nutrition Sciences, Music, and Art. There is so much good going on at UAB - we need to share the intensities and BEST of all of our worlds... Keep the standards HIGH! Invest in ways of attracting and keeping superior and interesting students. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member UAB Ambulatory is growing rapidly. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member My vision is that all students, faculty, and staff are truly engaged in fostering an high achieving, top ranking universities in the world. Online: Student, Staff, Community member continue high quality programming, enable more distance learning in higher degrees. Online: Alumnus UAB deserves to have its own school of law. Criminal Justice Majors should not have to receive their law degrees from Samford or the Birmingham School of Law. It is ridiculous that the only public University located in the largest city in the state of Alabama does not have a School of Law. I would like to see see a continued emphasis on new construction, and greenspace creation. I would like to see 14th Street between University and 10th Avenue South turned into green space, and 14th Street between 7th Avenue South University and 7th Avenue turned into greenspace, leaving access to the parking deck. This would link the new student center to Bartow Arena, and provide extra space for tailgating for the basketball games. There is a group of us who enjoy tailgating for the Saturday games. UAB also deserves to be able to offer an Executive MBA Program. There is a billboard at the Red Mountain Expressway exit onto University Boulevard advertising an Executive MBA degree for another University. Again UAB is located in the largest city in the state of Alabama, and the Birmingham Metro area is headquarters to several large corporations. UAB Athletics deserve to be in the American Athletic Conference with Memphis, Tulane, Cincinnati, etc. These are former Conference USA members who drew large crowds to football and basketball games. UAB should have been allowed to leave with Memphis, DePaul, Cincinnati, etc. when they joined the Big East. If UAB had been allowed to move up, UAB may have been able to keep Mike Anderson as head coach of the basketball team. I would like to see the restrooms upgraded in Bartow Arena. There is a huge need for automatic sinks and automatic toilets. Nobody likes the push down sinks, and I believe Bartow Arena is the only place in the United States where those still exist. Also, I would like to see the addition of griddles and frying stations to Bartow to allow the sale of chicken tenders, hamburgers, and fries. This would expand the menu, and I would start eating at the arena before games. UAB must do a better job of promoting athletics. There should be large peel and stick murals of basketball players on the windows of the new student center. Several thousand cars pass that building every day, and they should know when the next home game is. There are many families who would like to take their children out for inexpensive entertainment. Online: Alumnus Football stadium! Online: Alumnus to be a lot more lenient with its employees. a lot of people LOVE the job, but dislike working here at UAB. Although UAB has a great name in care, do you guys take time out to see if your staff\/ employees are okay? do they even matter? or is it just about the money, and the satisfactory ratings from patients? Online: Alumnus No football team. The Mayo Clinic, The Cleveland Clinic are world renowned because they are living their mission. UAB doesn't know what it is. Online: Alumnus I view it as a comprehensive, world-renown university that excels in all areas, especially medicine, business, education, archaeology, technology, and athletics! Online: Alumnus That UAB will have its own seperate Board of Trustees. A seperate Board of Trustees vested in the best interest of UAB and not controlled by alumni from another school with competing interests. Online: Alumnus I would like to see student enrollment to increase. I would like to see more dollars put into Athletics. If you put money to make athletics one of best in conference, then the university will grow and become even better. I would like to see more student parking decks. I want UAB to be the place faculty and students want to come ahead of all other universities. Online: Alumnus An on campus football stadium. More student parking decks. A bell tower in the middle of the campus green. A new president of UAB, preferably someone younger and with more personality. Online: Alumnus, Community member Continued improvement in athletics to try and erase the black eye of the nationally recognized mistakes that have been made in the past. Improving pediatric oncology physicians by recruiting well trained and respected pediatric oncologists. Bring pediatric oncology treatments up to the standard that has been set for adult oncology.Also improve relations with Children's of Alabama to allow certain pediatric surgeries to be performed at UAB where specialized equipment is located. Currently a certain age range is excluded from robotic surgery due to the unwillingness to incorporate pediatric anesthesiologists for surgeries at UAB. Online: Alumnus, Community member I envision UAB a resource for students to create and design both art and marketable products, as well as perform research, and learn professional skills. Online: Community member For UAB to be a leader and innovator in all fields. For the UAB School of Education to compete with the University of Virginia, Vanderbilt, Columbia Teacher's college, Johns Hopkins, etc. For the School of Education to have financial support that is commensurate with other schools. To promote competitive and innovative doctoral programs that increase the status of the School of Education. For instance, it is surprising that UAB doesn't have a doctoral program in Kinesiology given the NORC and the Center for Exercise Medicine. It is also surprising that the School of Education doesn't have a doctoral program in Educational Psychology or Educational Research methodology to support innovative research methods. Moreover, why doesn't the SoE have a doctoral program in Counselor Education when such a program is needed to advance a university's status in the field? The SoE cannot be successful if the school doesn't have access to the most basic resources. Online: None given dissipation of silos; continuum focused and improved pop health focus Online: None given A better preclinic. Online: None given Steady faculty, high boards pass rate Online: None given Better parking. Online: None given Increase diversity Online: None given UAB has A LOT of potential. It is unfortunate that people view UAB as a commuter school, but I think any step away from this identity will make UAB seem a lot more lively and interesting to prospective and even current students. The Commons- The staff is excellent! They are all so kind. I think that instead of focusing on making diverse and different foods each week, the Commons should focus on the quality of a certain amount of meals. The Commons does not provide enough food\/food options for the amount of people who eat there. Online: None given That we have a comprehensive strategic plan for UAB which includes SOM and the Health System Online: None given To be measured by our inner character Online: None given Be big but feel like a community Online: None given Parking. Online: None given An institution that knows what it wants and how to get there. (And it is not just a medical school with a university attached to it.) Online: None given UAB needs more parking and a bigger Sterne library. Online: None given 25,000 full-time undergraduates, all freshmen and sophomores living in UAB dormitories or greek houses, 50% out of state enrollment, a co-flagship status with UAT and reality (similar to Berkeley & UCLA, UNLV & UNR, etc.) Online: None given Being better than we are now. Being strategic about career development, talent management and succession planning. Trusting our own eternal experts instead of contracting out services. Online: None given UAB really cares about attracting freshmen. Online: None given Better training employees - staff and management - in all areas - project management, performance, productivity, increased student population both onsite and online, decreased health insurance, more days off during the Christmas and New Year's holidays, flexible schedules Online: None given Please start solid Computer Science department and offer wide variety of Computer Science courses. Hire top experienced talent from top Universities. Online: Parent, Community member My vision for UAB in 2021 is that the University be lead by someone who is most interested in OUR school, rather than one down the road. If Carol Garrison is unavailable, someone of her caliber would be appreciated. Online: Parent, Community member UAB at a crossroad - shrinking college age population is encouraging administration to look outside to online, out of state and international students. In-person response from listening sessions Move from local to international. In-person response from listening sessions Culturally will be like it is today. In-person response from listening sessions More interaction with medical school. In-person response from listening sessions Leveraging the excellence of the medical school. In-person response from listening sessions \"One School\" \"One University.\" In-person response from listening sessions Interdisciplinary programs - fewer barriers. In-person response from listening sessions Lip service to interdisciplinary programs but many many barriers. In-person response from listening sessions AT a crossroads. If mission has been focused toward a local student population. We're being forced to look outward. We're going to have to rethink and redefine ourselves accordingly. Infrastructure needs. Faculty parking, new classroom buildings, etc. to accommodate a new, larger university. In-person response from listening sessions Do we need to think about ourselves a LOT different? Definitely need infrastructure. UAB the cultural\/feel of it to maintain is to get rid of our older buildings (HB, CB, SOE). How to do that when we need classrooms. [encouraged to look at the campus master plan]. In-person response from listening sessions More interaction between the med and university side. Tenure for example - they have same frustrations as we do. They were very curious about us. How can we leverage the medical school to advantage our undergrads. One school. Great collaborations could happen that way. Little diffusion between the lines of these areas. In-person response from listening sessions Invest in the classroom\/labs to be top-notch. Funding of graduate students has always been a nightmare because it's been..... No guaranteed funding. We haven't been competitive. WE don't have RAs and TAs like UA has. Some departments have them, but not consistent model. Graduate school deans have been unable to make real changes. Top grads go elsewhere. Though our academics are strong - no funding guarantee incites doubt. In-person response from listening sessions Graduate education is a weak area. Most of those peers have pHD pograms outside of the sciences. Need to get our hands around other departments. History\/English\/the arts. In-person response from listening sessions Add Master's students. No sharing across departments to understand potential funding mechanism. In-person response from listening sessions Interdisciplinarity not just in research, but in teaching as well! Publicity can come from this. Hard to construct interdisciplinary programs because of the CHP structure. In-person response from listening sessions Lot of barriers to free faculty to be collaborative between departments. Only increasing in difficulty b\/c CHP. A lot of lip service, but structural barriers exist. In-person response from listening sessions Undergraduate research is difficult. Need more supervision. Students from other departments don't help with CHP. A lot of work. No compensation. Huge time-sink and responsibility. Don't really see much change in 5 years. In-person response from listening sessions Not much bigger growth in 5 years. In 10 years maybe. Definitely have more students. Surprise to have more students. Now stand alone Business school that will attract more students. Engineering will have room to grow. Don't see really drastic change in 5 years. In-person response from listening sessions QUESTION: Do you feel like we need to change? ANSWER: Yes, focus on South America for recruitment of exchange students, but think about how to attract them when they are poor students. Philanthropic movement to help bring those students to here. UAB clinic in Nicaragua, for example. It could grow. I wish we had more scholarship\/financial support for those students to come. How to help students who cannot pay to be able to afford UAB. Could help with marketing\/advertising purposes. In-person response from listening sessions We are interested in local outreach activities. The Research Foundation has involved us in tours for high school students and other groups. It's really exciting to see the lightbulb go off when they can see opportunities in scientific careers. In-person response from listening sessions Difficulty is that there's no return of inner city\/Birmingham areas even after they come to visit our campus. Unless their parents are employees, they rarely come unless they get scholarships. Not really recruiting students from summer camps. We are helping those students with our summer programs, and while that's good, they're not coming back to us. In-person response from listening sessions Rethinking our balance between merit and need-based scholarships. UK, for example is becoming more evenly balanced between merit and need-based scholarships. In-person response from listening sessions Our undergrad student body will continue to grow. Making the UAB experience a \"normal\" experience should continue. I do, however, worry about funding for our researchers because it's so competitive. But not sure what we can do because it's a national level problem - will that decrease over the next 4 years because funding looks to be cut. In-person response from listening sessions We need to be hyper aware of the national picture. Funding at the national levels may change - particularly in certain pockets. Diversification of where the funding comes from at UAB needs to change (NSF, DOEnergy, NASA, etc.) and not necessarily focused on biomedical. Really great faculty that are supported significantly so that a snowball effect happens so that faculty across the nation want to come here. In-person response from listening sessions Should be one great university. In-person response from listening sessions Faculty and staff more engaged in local communities. In-person response from listening sessions Will have better parking. In-person response from listening sessions Coordinated University and community events. In-person response from listening sessions Events on the week-end and students anxious to remain on campus. In-person response from listening sessions More alumni are on campus. In-person response from listening sessions Better parking. - Allen mentioned campus master planning process we are doing a housing and parking and transportation study that will be identifying where our needs are. In-person response from listening sessions QUESTION: Would a more involved student life look like? ANSWER: more people staying on the weekend - more events on campus to draw the students in. a more relaxed atmosphere. Possibly more focus on Friday\/Saturday events. In-person response from listening sessions Nonmedical programs have grown up In-person response from listening sessions Destination university In-person response from listening sessions More activities for graduate students In-person response from listening sessions More on campus living facilities - increased housing infrastructure In-person response from listening sessions 24,000 students In-person response from listening sessions Reduction in bureaucracy In-person response from listening sessions Letting the other programs grow up. It's a multifaceted place. Being known for the large footprint in BHM. Urban area and collaboration there. Progress with the tech we need and see how we can expand outside of BHM. In-person response from listening sessions Alumni engagement has room to grow. Trying to bring them back in. Once we get them back - they're hooked. Looking at Data to do that better. Having more people connected than before. In-person response from listening sessions I'd want prospective students to have UAB as one of their top choices. First choice. Be excited about having UAB as their first choice or I only applied to UAB. Making it exciting to come here? In-person response from listening sessions In-person response from listening sessions QUESTION: Do we need Greeks? Football\/sporting\/social life? ANSWER: maybe eventually, but I don't know about greek housing on campus, but some growth might make it more attractive. Making it a place that's fun socially and quality education. I lived on campus and loved it even though I was only from 25 miles from here. I was in close proximity to things to do. It really enhanced my educational experience. The return of FB will help. By 2021 we will have gained momentum. In-person response from listening sessions A new stadium would increase participation in those events. An on-campus stadium would help. Tailgating on the green, etc. An all-day event. In-person response from listening sessions Hope UAB will keep its uniqueness. Students here are different students. They know theyre driven, they know where they want to go. Not the same as UA or Auburn. Hope we don't move away from that. In-person response from listening sessions Virtually all the MBA studens did their undergrads elsewhere. We couldn't seem to get their allegiance to their undergrad school. Is that still a problem? - Yes, that's not unique to UAB. In-person response from listening sessions I attribute it to the majority of CSOB going online. Those that are on campus have more allegiance. Example of BSN vs MSN students. In-person response from listening sessions I came to classes then left to work then came back. In-person response from listening sessions Difficult to engage graduate students. We have to meet them where they are. MBA has to make it into some kind of networking event. Make connections, etc. approach it more professionally than we can for the undergraduate level. In-person response from listening sessions More walkable campus In-person response from listening sessions Less silos In-person response from listening sessions More of a campus feel In-person response from listening sessions More employee interaction In-person response from listening sessions No UAB \"water cooler\" In-person response from listening sessions More international in character In-person response from listening sessions Maps throughout campus \"You Are Here\" In-person response from listening sessions Better signage In-person response from listening sessions Almost everything takes place at Hill Center - should be throughout campus In-person response from listening sessions More collaboration among school In-person response from listening sessions No one knows what the plan is In-person response from listening sessions Better campus transit In-person response from listening sessions Shouldn't have to pay to park to work here In-person response from listening sessions Hear more about UAB than we do today In-person response from listening sessions People feel less intimidated about the scale and size of UAB In-person response from listening sessions Better community perception In-person response from listening sessions Complex but not complicated In-person response from listening sessions More transparent on how we do business In-person response from listening sessions More true college feel In-person response from listening sessions Tired of playing frogger with cars. Walkable campus! A safe-walkable. In-person response from listening sessions More of a campus feel. Campus green feels that way. Outside of that, don't know if you're in or out of UAB or BHM. In-person response from listening sessions More employee interaction with each other. More actually being involved whether you work for patient or student area. In-person response from listening sessions Several years ago I worked at another medical center. They had strong employee cohesion. Bowling league, etc. camaraderie. Perhaps build upon that. Is there a void there. In-person response from listening sessions I have often heard that there's not a UAB water cooler. I know so many people, but only see certain ones at meetings like this. We don't have a gathering place for staff\/employees. In-person response from listening sessions Physical location is disconnecting. Spending time for lunch break to walk down to HSC is difficult and makes you feel like you're not part of the team. If they just physically relocated the buildings that'd be great. In-person response from listening sessions Cohesive - knowing what the strategic plan is would help. While I understand the process, it's not really articulated to anyone else. WE can't serve as ambassadors unless we're involved in hearing what the common threads are. We should all know parts of the message. What the talking points are. Celebrate who we are at UAB. In-person response from listening sessions We can all say who UAB is to us, but who UAB is to the larger population may need common definition. Share consistently. In-person response from listening sessions Good forum to get feedback - suggestion that it would have been good to have upper management tell us where they would like to see us go. A lot of thought has been given to this - would help to know what our leaders were saying. In-person response from listening sessions Better on-campus transit for people in remote parking. ? by better you mean? - wait time is long (what I've heard from peers) between busses. In-person response from listening sessions Hard selling point to people coming in - BTW, you need to park in remote parking. In-person response from listening sessions Not only where they park, but having to pay to park where you work. Seems wrong in my mind. If you stand on red mountain UAB takes up a huge proportion of BHM, but you don't see a lot of UAB on a daily basis. Why aren't we telling our story more. May be the disconnect between UAB and everyone else. In-person response from listening sessions Transportation issue also affects the disconnect between one side to the other. Changing busses doesn't help. Stops are not efficient. Figure out a way to have a straight-shot shuttle would help bringing in People from remote parking. In-person response from listening sessions In-person response from listening sessions Patients are constantly lost. Random signs of walking trails. Not just emergency signs. Signage should be much better. No clear direction. Might be an issue to our pedestrians. In-person response from listening sessions Maybe create a \"ask a blazer\" station for patients. In-person response from listening sessions Almost every day where I park, I have to tell someone where to go. They look around and look so lost. In-person response from listening sessions Buildings are abbreviated - no real name of the buildings. In-person response from listening sessions Perception thing. For people who don't work at UAB or some of the older generation they think that place is enormous and they tend to avoid it unless forced into a medical situation. WE are user friendly. People are intimidated by the size of UAB. They hear good things, but.....our perception should be that we're part of the big community. Need to make people know that we're accessible. We are caring individuals. In-person response from listening sessions A concierge service (patients\/employees\/students). In-person response from listening sessions Be and act like a mature institution. If part of our identity is who we serve, then we need to be more friendly and welcoming (signage, transportation, concierge), then we should do those things. We should all be invested in those 3-4 things and know what those goals are. In-person response from listening sessions Be held accountable to that vision.. In-person response from listening sessions If staff are patients as well - it should be easy to get that information. Shouldn't take 5+ phone calls. Things are difficult unless you know someone. In-person response from listening sessions Complex but not complicated! In-person response from listening sessions One of the initiatives is trying to attract more international students. Could be one of the go-to universities for being welcoming to international students. In-person response from listening sessions Faculty too. That reinforces the need to signage. Clear means\/training to understand the needs of visitors\/guests. Is there a campus map like in a mall? I think the only one is in the unity park. In-person response from listening sessions Transportation across BHM sucks. You can be on campus and get around, but anything else you need you can't really get there - it's all too far away. City\/UAB partnership. Collaborative efforts across schools - what are our barriers to doing work across schools? Why can't we come together to make that work to push boundaries to do even greater things. Less siloed. Things have improved but we have a long way to go - even within my own school. We're not alone, but we can do better. In-person response from listening sessions First choice institution especially for AL students. In-person response from listening sessions Less waste on landscaping In-person response from listening sessions Accept we will never have only an ok but never a beautiful campus In-person response from listening sessions More nonlocal students - More out of state students In-person response from listening sessions Green initiative In-person response from listening sessions Pioneering in green movement In-person response from listening sessions Buying flowers every three months is wasteful of funds. Buy perennials. In-person response from listening sessions We have an OK looking campus. More sustainable. Bioswales is cool! We have the potential to be a pioneer in the city of sustainability that can save money and be beautiful. In-person response from listening sessions In-person response from listening sessions Recruit from other states. In-person response from listening sessions Fruit bearing trees or a garden blazer bucks with the farmers market. Alternatives to plastic from cafeterias. In-person response from listening sessions Interconnectedness to the city and to former students even after we've left. In-person response from listening sessions Total recycling in Birmingham. How do we get a recycling plant here. Sustainability for all of BHM. In-person response from listening sessions A more unified campus. Senior project (capstone). Something specific on campus to improve the campus. Using that platform to better the university\/city. Helping students make a difference. The students made UAB. Curriculum into practice. In-person response from listening sessions More art on campus. Murals on our buildings. Like the \"It's nice to have you in Birmingham\" sign. In-person response from listening sessions Students seen as change agents and leaders in the future of campus and the city. In-person response from listening sessions Greek housing\/ on campus stadium In-person response from listening sessions Signs on entering campus In-person response from listening sessions More university pride In-person response from listening sessions More pedestrian safety In-person response from listening sessions More self-sufficient campus In-person response from listening sessions More week-end events In-person response from listening sessions Embrace our urbanness In-person response from listening sessions Better marketing and communication to real and potential feeders - local high schools, etc. In-person response from listening sessions More engagement\/involvement of all segments of the University In-person response from listening sessions Cultural corridor - promote it better In-person response from listening sessions Unified marketing In-person response from listening sessions More accessible campus - disability resources - beyond compliance In-person response from listening sessions I think of dreams when I'm thinking of visions. In-person response from listening sessions Stadium and greek housing. In-person response from listening sessions Help the momentum continue with pedestrian safety and road improvements like we're doing on 10th. Change the driving culture of our students. Outdoor opportunities. In-person response from listening sessions Students staying here on the weekends. In-person response from listening sessions I have a daughter graduating from Homewood. She's chosen UAB. Her friends have said there's nothing to do at UAB on the weekends. UAB is \"boring.\" That said, she fell in love with the urban campus. If we could develop things for the kids to do, that would help with keeping them here. She's not a huge sports person, but many of her peers are into sports\/partying\/ etc. In-person response from listening sessions More sharing of what we have to offer. If students feel this way, then we need to communicate better. In-person response from listening sessions UAB loves nerds! In-person response from listening sessions See UAB and downtown as a college student vs. as a high school student. Changing parental perspectives. Breaking that kind of thoughts. In-person response from listening sessions In-person response from listening sessions Marketing and communications across campus. We have things but they don't necessarily know about it. Sharing with high schools\/community colleges. Be proactive. Be forward thinking. In-person response from listening sessions A place where the students curricular and co-curricular activities are joined more. Let's start classes on Wednesday for the first week. That's a true transition orientation and onboarding experience. Transfer students too. Have upperclassmen help plan these things. Collaborations across\/among the classroom and co-curriculars. Faculty are onboarded with hosting opportunities and understand the student\/human development component. Let's provide them with a cohesive transition from outside in. In-person response from listening sessions I want that [previous statement] for everyone. I want that for every member of the UAB community to have high expectations and be fully engaged. Embracing from their first experience throughout their career. In-person response from listening sessions Greek housing and stadium. Continuing cultivation of the arts corridor. ASC, AEIVA, expanding programming opportunities, etc. meld those activities to the interior of the campus into In-person response from listening sessions QUESTION: How to encourage people to attend more events? ANSWER: reduced costs of tickets. Staff discounts\/student discounts. They exist, but need to tell more people about that. In-person response from listening sessions Communications of these events is key! In-person response from listening sessions Unified marketing - erasing conflicting events. We don't communicate\/coordinate across the university. Need an oversight organization. Encouraging the use of a campus-wide calendar. In-person response from listening sessions UAB to be a more accessible campus for employees\/students. Being more intentional across the board. Through Purchasing system\/other systems\/course design. Accessibility is more than just infrastructural investments. Let's go beyond compliance because it's the right thing to do. In-person response from listening sessions Uptown football stadium In-person response from listening sessions 25,000 students by 2021 In-person response from listening sessions Continue to support cultural diversity In-person response from listening sessions Increase in quality ranking In-person response from listening sessions More of a community resource - assisting to keep employers and employees in City In-person response from listening sessions Rated higher in non-health areas In-person response from listening sessions More cooperation among units - e.g. engineering, athletics, medicine with new football helmet In-person response from listening sessions Campus more traditional and sustainable In-person response from listening sessions A destination university In-person response from listening sessions Maybe we should recognize we are an urban university and stop trying so hard to me traditional In-person response from listening sessions Uptown Football Stadium by 2021. Not just so we can play there, but so that other sporting events (world games) to happen there. Having it in Northtown is a good thing since we started there. In-person response from listening sessions In-person response from listening sessions New focus to grow enrollment should continue aggressively. Get to the range of 25K students. More alumni. Raises the profile of the school. I wouldn't want to put an upward limit. Want quality growth - smart growth. Growth in undergraduate and graduate growth. More of a defined campus\/beautification. More people leads In-person response from listening sessions I would like to see the university continue to support the cultural diversity that we have and be a place that welcomes people from all over the world. That's been from the very beginning of UAB. In-person response from listening sessions Revamp a lot of the buildings. Like humanities building. Education Building. In-person response from listening sessions Continue to define its borders. Greenspace. Walkability. More housing. So much energy in so much we do scientific side. Seeing growth in business and other areas is exciting. Help take all disciplines to the next level to impact economic growth. We have a great engine to create those new businesses and keep them here. Keep that front end rate going up. In-person response from listening sessions Exciting to see our rankings increase across the disciplines - not just medical rankings. In-person response from listening sessions Quality of students. Maintain our research grant power. The interdisciplinary\/global scope of UAB to take on these projects is great. In-person response from listening sessions Commitment to the sport side is so good to help Alumni stay engaged year over year. In-person response from listening sessions Sustainability leader in BHM and going farther. 100% solar powered universitye In-person response from listening sessions Number 1 in whatever we do. If the rankings are respectable (quality) then yes rankings are important. It does change the perception. In-person response from listening sessions Do you throw dollars into something that may be \"insignificant\" to move a rankings needle just for perception? Maybe pick certain disciplines to grow incrementally throughout the universities. In-person response from listening sessions Depends on the ranking, the metrics used. In-person response from listening sessions We have an obligation to take care of the state. To bring up the health\/welfare of our entire state. In-person response from listening sessions Being in a certain niche is important. Can't be all things to all people. Engineering, BME, whatever, if we're in those top spaces, then now you're a destination university. In-person response from listening sessions I've continued to be impressed each time I come back - been coming back since 1981. In-person response from listening sessions Consistent message from top down In-person response from listening sessions Need to all line up with what is happening at top In-person response from listening sessions Decentralization is great but how do we balance decentralization with needed centralization In-person response from listening sessions Our units compete with each other In-person response from listening sessions So many of our services are fragmented - need unity of purpose In-person response from listening sessions Need accountability\/responsibility to get things done so we can reduce redundancy In-person response from listening sessions Student centered within health of vision In-person response from listening sessions Trying to be all things to all people In-person response from listening sessions More staff orientation\/employee centered In-person response from listening sessions Strategic planning needs to empower diversity In-person response from listening sessions Take more advantage of international student opportunities In-person response from listening sessions More institutional pride In-person response from listening sessions Serve the mission In-person response from listening sessions Safer. Eliminate cars on campus. In-person response from listening sessions Stop running red lights. In-person response from listening sessions Expedite travel\/safety\/campus safety investments In-person response from listening sessions Students are not reporting accidents - need to change that culture. In-person response from listening sessions Innovation In-person response from listening sessions We have a lot of potential intellectual property that we are not capitalizing on. In-person response from listening sessions Play on the diversity. In-person response from listening sessions Comprehensive university with a complete educational experience. In-person response from listening sessions Good outcomes for jobs and employement for ugrad and grad students. In-person response from listening sessions Better coordinated better marketed not ad hoc effort with the community. UAB's understanding of its impact on the community. People don't know the changes that are happening here. In-person response from listening sessions There;s a lot more to being an educated person than just job preparation. We want to balance economic mobility with a liberal education and having a rich conception of what an education means. In-person response from listening sessions Center of excellence for educational access. i.e. economic inequity, international students. That's where we can shine. In-person response from listening sessions Continue to have thriving on-campus as opposed to online education. In-person response from listening sessions A research 1 university is first and foremost one where sutdnets interact on campus. Invest in the library. Liberal arts education is a key component to even STEM curricula. Focus on the CORE curriculum. In-person response from listening sessions Should be a place where students can be civically engaged in the community. Research happens, but also learning about the liberal arts and how to engage in and impact the community. In-person response from listening sessions Community knowledge sharing and civic engagement - involvement in internationalism\/globalism. Human rights. Bringing in students from around the planet and enhancing study abroad. Global citizenship. More than just AL and one particular nation. Ecology\/economics\/education\/health. Agreed. In-person response from listening sessions Institutional commitment to being members of all of the communities that we talked about but also engaging our students in the educational process. In-person response from listening sessions Shared governance more than just lip service, but basically administration. Independent faculty senate with strong independent voice. In-person response from listening sessions I don't think we'll ever be a small liberal arts college, but if administration viewed ugrad education to be recognized. Ugrad teaching is not a machine. Not something you can treat as mechanistic. In-person response from listening sessions Diliberate and strategic moves re online offers. Not following the herd there. Not trying to be at the head of the market. Rather on educational efficacy. Represents real work and real achievement. In-person response from listening sessions Paperless In-person response from listening sessions Laboratories are more engaging. Labs look like the 1970's In-person response from listening sessions President and Provost need to embellish innovative teaching (HHMI) In-person response from listening sessions Must be more high level support for undergraduate education In-person response from listening sessions More flexible lab space In-person response from listening sessions Greater awareness of UAB nationally In-person response from listening sessions More interaction with City In-person response from listening sessions Students understand and interact more with local industry In-person response from listening sessions Convergence and multidisciplinary In-person response from listening sessions Technology is key In-person response from listening sessions UAB needs to be more of a \"system\" with all parts working together In-person response from listening sessions Must be distinctive -

In-person response from listening sessions How can we be innovative with a lack of technology, a culture of \"no\", everything in triplicate (paperwork)? In-person response from listening sessions UAB grew out of the SOM, UPitt medical school grew out of the university while UCSD's strength is in its cross culture. In-person response from listening sessions It is time to bring additional value to other UAB elements such as theatre and the arts, and not just medicine and research. In-person response from listening sessions The Vision Institute, concern for our urban community, helping with pro bono work, and community engagement were mentioned.

Who are the world class stars at UAB? In-person response from listening sessions We are at a crossroads - initially decentralized everyone did what they wanted. Now we face a hopeless bureaucracy In-person response from listening sessions We have to pick what we are doing and be good at it In-person response from listening sessions Different generations mixing in educational experiences In-person response from listening sessions Need a K-12 University school In-person response from listening sessions Customized curricula In-person response from listening sessions Innovative programs In-person response from listening sessions Better marketing of UAB In-person response from listening sessions Learning from other units In-person response from listening sessions More interdisciplinary In-person response from listening sessions Question 3: In which areas should UAB focus its investments? Answer Affiliation The proposed proton radiation therapy facility at face value seems like a huge monetary investment that will benefit a relatively small number of patients. I believe UAB should focus its investments in retaining current faculty so that they are not recruited away from our great institution. Online: Faculty A lot of attention has been paid to the Regional Campuses, but there is no focus on supporting what we do well: education and promoting Primary Care. Instead, we get asked why we are not pursuing more research (the UAB focus). Our medical students get told \"you are too smart for primary care\" when they are at the main campus. UAB needs to support primary care initiatives with more than just words. Create a Family Medicine department at the Birmingham Campus. Provide more incentives for students to choose primary care. Negotiate with Viva so regional faculty can be UAB Viva providers. These measures will not look good on the books, because education and primary care are not lucrative (unlike research, love those indirects to build more onto the Birmingham campus). But in this era where we are forced to recruit residents from other countries because no one wants to do primary care, and DO schools are popping up like mushrooms after a rain, I would hope UAB would provide what this country really needs...not another dermatologist or a health disparities researcher, but primary care doctors. Online: Faculty Children's Health in particular development of children and social-emotional development. Work with the departments of pediatrics and be able to provide a unified approach with other centers for this children, and increase division of developmental and behavioral pediatrics. Building a center in collaboration with Children's and close to the hospital were children are also cared for will be ideal to provide a safe and excellent for these special needs children Online: Faculty Recruitment of high impact investigators such as NAS members and.or have NIH\/NSF program funding that can replace the massive losses in such program (SPOREs, PPGs, R01s, etc) funding that have occurred over the past 15 years. We are talking probably $200M simply to return to the position we once were amid an environment that is much more competitive. It will take more, because this type of investigator tends to have first impressions of Birmingham as an undesirable place to live (although it's not) after having spent most of their professional life in larger cities. Or we could just decide that this is not our vision anymore be happy with a big clinical operation and a medical school. Online: Faculty UAB needs to focus on it's core areas of strength going forward, and invest in clinical care, clinical education and biomedical research facilities, faculty, and personnel. Online: Faculty Medicine and Health Sciences, including connections to the undergraduate programs and business school. Honors College. Philanthropy. NOT just growth in # of undergraduates - follow the example of USC when Sample took it from C to A Online: Faculty 1. More work in the diversity field. 2. Help in supporting autonomy when it comes to areas of innovation by the different faculty staff and students without being bogged down in lots of red tape and bureaucracy Online: Faculty I am concerned that programs that do not admit doctoral students to perform full-time research will receive EXTREMELY limited funding (if any). As an R1 university, I highly value our commitment to research and believe that research is a fundamental aspect of each and every program's existence on this campus. However, programs outside of STEM\/GBS do not have the same opportunities for federal and intramural grant funding, do not have the same amount of time as their STEM\/GBS counterparts (I have a 3\/3 course load as an assistant professor in the Counselor Education Program in the School of Education), and do not have the administrative support to find, write, and develop grants. This is frustrating for me. Counseling's mission to recruit nationally and internationally will not be fulfilled without a doctoral program. That said, there is no evidence that UAB would ever support us in having a doctoral program given our field of study. I would like UAB to consider other schools and programs when making decisions. Online: Faculty UAB should do a better job of caring for the health of our own students and faculty. With an institution that owns its own health insurance company, health care system, and health policy researchers, we already have in place many of the necessary ingredients to figure out how to create a model health care system within our own community. When students are without care, or when faculty and staff are not receiving the best possible care, I think we are failing in our obligations to one another and the broader region. Police and firefighters look after their own, even my hairdresser does; why don't we strive for this same commitment to purpose? Online: Faculty Healthcare education and research with continued attention to undergraduate studies that complement the larger healthcare mission. Online: Faculty 1) sustainability\/recycling, 2) increased paid parental leave (more than the 4 weeks given now), 3) more lactation rooms on campus, 4) increased salaries to keep good faculty in the health care sciences Online: Faculty Physical structure\/equipment improvement and improved wage and salary status in the community. Online: Faculty I would have said excellence in teaching, in scholarship, and research. Not looking at grants purely as a revenue stream (how much can we suck out of the research dollars for central admin). Not looking at students as a source of revenue (that 30 year contract to bring in foreign students, etc.) But I just work here. Online: Faculty In order to move to the top level in research, UAB needs to identify the funds needed to attract Nobel laureates, Lasker award winners, national academy of science members. More support of the graduate program for smaller schools will help them to be more competitive for federal training awards. Online: Faculty Reduce number of bureaucrats by 60%. Online: Faculty transportation around campus is still a major issue, the buses aren't solving it. There is a lack of transparency with parking and costs. Libraries are underfunded and lack of resources has long-term impacts on education, research, patient care. Online: Faculty Assistant Professor endowments. Right now the funding climate is tough and Assistant Professors need protected time to develop their research agenda without simply \"working for someone else\". We also need more PhD and post-doctoral training grants. Attracting the best and the brightest young people will pay dividends in 10 years as they age and develop a loyalty to UAB. Online: Faculty academics (on ground, blended, and online), shared research infrastructure Online: Faculty New areas: 1. Adherence\/self-management of chronic disease, 2. Electronic health records that incorporate social and environmental data (e.g., via geocoding of residential addresses to link to neighborhood-level data) that can be used as a risk-assessment tool, Current areas of focus as necessary Online: Faculty UAB should focus investments in maintaining high quality faculty and researchers. Specifically, investments should be made in recruiting and retaining tenured\/tenure track faculty. There should be investments in terms of focused hiring of tenured\/tenure track faculty rather than relying on adjunct faculty. The increased reliance on adjunct faculty in place of full time faculty harms the university's reputation and the quality of education provided to our students. Online: Faculty mentoring programs, for those who are not actively engaged in research, ie teaching faculty and staff, as well as students Online: Faculty The School of Education with more higher education degree options; other than elementary education. Online: Faculty Curb cuts, open zone parking with wide spaces, large stall bathrooms Online: Faculty Excellence initiatives. Fast tracking important initiatives of each department. Just like the hospital and ambulatory units have a portion of reimbursement tied to performance, employees should have incentive pay that is tied to performance or reaching some measurable goal or success Online: Faculty High end multidisciplinary research which will include science and engineering. Caliber of research and education goals should include the Vision that they will receive recognition of Nobel and equivalent prices. Money will follow. Online: Faculty Supporting and investing in science and engineering without which medical research cannot be successful. Attracting high-level graduate students to the research with scholarships. Online: Faculty Research growth and development through faculty recruitment and support. Fostering innovative collaborations with business entities and individual entrepreneurs. Online: Faculty, Alumnus What do you mean for this question? Investments in improving the university of investments as in endowment? If you mean endowment, I strongly encourage socially responsible investments (eg, if you want to grow students who care about other and the planet then strong investments in fossil fuels send the wrong message). If you mean in improving the university, I still feel that better child care means better family support for your employees and students. Online: Faculty, Alumnus, Community member The first to years of helping student matriculate. We need to stop the number games of more and more students when we have such a poor graduation rate. If only 42% of the patients survived at UAB hospital would you call that success? No, so why do we think we are such as great university with such poor graduation rates. Online: Faculty, Alumnus, Community member Nurse led clinics for disease management Online: Faculty, Community member Elimination of poverty and education opportunity. Help the city and county public schools and the parents and teachers who live in this city and county. . Online: Faculty, Community member Support for our graduate students is one of the major barriers for many departments. Tuition should be waived so that PIs can use funding to support competitive stipends following two years of support from the graduate school. Online: Faculty, Parent, Community member Facility and cleaning staff. I'm mainly in the volker hall and optometry school (peter's building) and it is not up to other tier 1 universities. The lecture halls have poor control over lighting. The projection screen is too high for the Volker lecture halls. It is considered old and barely functional even compared to the older university that I graduated from. Restrooms are stained and old. Cleaning staff should be on campus until at least 5:00 to remove trash during the day. Trash gets piled up from Friday afternoon that just sits there during the weekend then leading to rodent problems. Online: Faculty, Staff IT- been grossly under invested in over the last decade and seems to be well led now. Facilities - must address deferred building maintenance, Personalized medicine - game changer. Online: Faculty, Staff 1. Construct more parking. 2. Update patient care areas such as Jefferson Tower. 3. Continue to bring in the top research leaders, such as Dr. Tector and Dr. Cooper. I would try to invest in the \"Cancer Moon Shot\" initiative to the fullest extent. Cancer affects us all, and if UAB can be in the forefront of research and treatment, it would be a dream come true.

Online: Staff Patient services. To attract patients with choices and care for those without choices, we need to focus on the needs of both. Online: Staff With regards to our UAB community, invest in our staff and employees with programs such as employee wellness etc. I think those are wonderful. With regards to our community-community outreach to our underserved Alabama residents Online: Staff Greater diversity in upper management. More outreach programs for the surrounding community. Online: Staff Diversity training for staff as well as Providers Online: Staff Retaining their great employees. A 2-3% merit increase is hardly a morale booster. The poor employees are getting a 1 or 2% and the great ones get 3%. It is very discouraging to your excellent people when they are getting 10 cents more for a raise. Online: Staff Leadership must be a focus. On the health system and campus side, many leaders are overwhelmed and not equipped to handle the demands of their job. I am a \"leader\" in the organization. Many of my peers are overwhelmed and live in survivor mode. I have connections with many professors, physicians and healthcare leaders. Many report \"bullying\" from their own leaders. This is a symptom of leaders not be equipped with the right tools and resources. Online: Staff Current resources, structure and capital. UAB is changing, building, and adding a lot of \"the New\", but not maintaining and investing in the current and \"Old\". Whether it be people, processes, and especially buildings. Online: Staff HR processes - from start to finish, IT processes\/seamless systems, ways to reduce incoming email volumes Online: Staff State of the art medical equipment\/infrastructure and top research. Online: Staff 1) Simplify EMR- Look at CERNER and possibly go to their product and not the modified version we have. My staff who travel say that CERNER elsewhere is very good. 2) Have all medical teams round with WOW or Surface Pro and enter orders as they round. 3) Develop algorhythm for each top DRG that outlines LOS for that DRG and milestones to meet to move out of ICU and floor to home. Post that on white board and focus TOC rounds on the ones that fall off the outline. 4) Replace our mattresses to one that prevents skin breakdown. Our current beds are not satisfactory Online: Staff Employee compensation, wellness, and child care. Online: Staff It shouldn't be on one or two things. Employees, students, and patients are all vital and important parts of UAB. Making sure each entity is treated fairly and included. Online: Staff Student recruitment within the individual schools Online: Staff VA, Southern Research, Eye Foundation. These people are our neighbors\/affiliates. We need to treat them as such. Have special events that involve them. Make them feel special. Online: Staff More housing, ensuring maintenance is completed in a timely and appropriate manner, and increased security. Online: Staff employee pay, benefits, parking structures - UAB needs more parking decks. Online: Staff Parking, pedestrian safety, more space for teaching Online: Staff To increase retention, the university needs to invest in different academic support services. The Vulcan Materials Academic Success Center (VMASC) and the University Writing Center provide assistance to thousands of students, but have been unable to grow to their full potential due to a lack of funding. Investment in these two entities would help students persist to graduation. Online: Staff Staff development, Improved communication in every area across campus, Rebuilding Human Resources Online: Staff Follow the existing Strategic Plan until that plan changes. Online: Staff Free rec benefits for employees. Health and fitness are a vital part of working and it would be a huge benefit for employees and save money on insurance and doctor bills. Since we have to pay so much for parking, free work-out opportunities would be welcome. Someone mentioned in the meeting about seeing other college shirts all around campus. I see that as diversity. However, new students and employees could be given a shirt in a welcome package to promote UAB, Online: Staff Beyond a move towards shared governance, I feel that UAB should focus its investments on developing and retaining the staff we have. I truly feel we have a huge talent pool among our staff but encouragement of staff development is not a priority for managers at UAB. I really feel that staff members could benefit from a staff mentorship program. I really feel that if investment is made in the staff and their development, UAB will see the return on that investment. Online: Staff More on infrastructure. If enrollment is going to grow, more funds should be spent on classrooms and labs. More funds should be spent on programs for freshmen students and transfer students. Orientation needs reevaluation and processes need to be more efficient. Online: Staff Invest in developing leaders at all levels. Invest in an HR Infrastructure to support performance management, employee development, career growth, and succession planning across the enterprise. Online: Staff It would be nice for UAB to host free events for staff. This would bring us together and show what the campus has to offer. Adding signs across campus and making the I-65 S entrance more desirable is important for people who are unfamiliar with the area. Online: Staff UAB needs to invest in technology infrastructure and in developing quality online programs. Online: Staff In areas that will grow UAB's brand, retaining ambitious faculty and staff, attracting talented faculty and staff, grow our student population, increase student housing, and increase our efforts with sustainability. We need a more robust engineering program, which likely needs a new facility to attract faculty and students. Larger engineering programs could aid many of UAB's healthcare initiatives, especially with bioengineering. Online: Staff 1) Health Professions and Health Related Degrees, 2) Parking - this can become a very negative stigma for the campus, 3) Retention - Can we graduate the students we are admitting based on class availability and scheduling. 4) UAB needs to continue implementing new policies and systems (IT, admissions systems, student systems) that integrate the colleges and departments across campus. Online: Staff We need to develop a restaurant and bar \"strip\" that can be walked to from campus. Birmingham has good restaurants but they are spread out. Compare our campus to any other large southern university in this respect. It makes a big difference to the atmosphere. We need a dedicated research building that can accommodate clinical human research (parking for participants, etc.). Online: Staff Health and Safey Online: Staff People, community, environment.

Additionally, UAB should strengthened its existing relationships with strategic partners such as the Lakeshore Foundation and Southern Research. In addition, new partnerships could be developed with the area hospitals so as to showcase the Birmingham medical community as one of the best in the South. Perhaps start with St. Vincent's, they're just down the road from us! Online: Staff its people ie workers who might be able to make things better for the patients...we all take them for granted. Online: Staff UAB has done a terrific job of leveraging its core competencies and seeking out innovative ways to build upon those core competencies throughout the institution. UAB should continue to grow as an academic health sciences center and build innovative programs throughout the campus that leverage the quality of UAB Hospital and UAB Medicine. Both are seen as leaders in the state of Alabama. In addition, UAB should embrace that they are an urban campus and take advantage of innovative programs that give unique opportunities to interact with the community that other less urban campuses do not have. This will help to continue to maximize UAB's core competencies. Along with that, UAB should continue to invest in ways to minimize the disadvantages of urban institutions by improving transportation, creating more green spaces, and working closely with the city to continue to improve safety and develop resources for faculty, staff, students and patients close to campus. Online: Staff Simplification of processes, streamlining of processes, standardizing SOPs, policies and procedures. Leaders that can see the big picture and are good and explaining the big picture to everyone else. Invest in faculty\/staff\/students that are currently at the university - make them feel that they are important members of the community. I enjoy working at UAB for the most part but feel that for every step that we try to take forward we are pushed a block backwards. Online: Staff Adding a monorail, and service tunnels, and routing traffic around UAB, smaller dorms spread out over a larger area, even going up red mountain, setting up a serene campus overlooking the valleys, maybe even San Francisco like cable cars. Online: Staff Investments should be based on achieving the elements of the strategic plan...but that plan needs to be shared and known by all. Online: Staff Excellent Teaching Faculty.

Online: Staff, Alumnus Mentoring programs so that faculty, staff, students and postdocs that are already at UAB can learn from those around them. A successful mentoring program that is enterprise wide will give UAB a sense of community that it doesn't currently have. This lack of sense of community is one of the things that holds UAB back. Everyone is out for themselves, if we work together and see ourselves as an important part of the whole we can make UAB truly great. Online: Staff, Alumnus technology and employees Online: Staff, Alumnus, Community member Access to care (especially in off-site locations). Infrastructure (buildings, equipment, walkways, etc. ) Patient Safety and Satisfaction, Employee Satisfaction Online: Staff, Alumnus, Community member I would like to see a larger emphasis placed on the development of additional 100% online bachelors degrees. Troy University has done a great job at this. They have many options available and they do not charge additional fees for online classes. They charge a flat rate per credit hour for online courses. I would like to see many undergraduate degree options for UAB students, both in-person, online, and mixed. There are many students who would like to be UAB students but who can't because there are so few 100% online options. My student is one of them. She is an elite-level athlete who must travel to train and compete. UAB cannot meet her needs at present, though we REALLY wish it could. Online: Staff, Alumnus, Parent Over all undergraduate student experience. Cutting edge research. Quality internal employee support. In an effort to encourage new students, researchers, and employees to want to come and stay at UAB. Online: Staff, Alumnus, Parent, Community member on expanding the honors program and fully supporting the football program, get out of the UA system, and be it's own system, becoming THE university in ALABAMA in every aspect Online: Staff, Parent Black student awareness committee. This is the only program on campus that I know of that consistently brings students together. We have forums, galas, and many events that gather attention throughout the entire state such as the Camille Armstrong stepshow. Due to recent budget cuts the organization may have to cut funding for BSAC which will result in the end of this historical 25 year old step show. Online: Student Parking. Online: Student I believe beautification through greenery and architecture are important. I also think continuing making the campus as walkable and bicycle friendly is important as well. Online: Student I believe that UAB should invest more time, energy, and money into the social sciences. Some of the greatest minds I have ever encountered are serving faithfully in these departments. Also, parking is a nightmare on and around campus. It is the only discouraging thing about this university. From all indications, more buildings are going up that will require even more parking. Furthermore, it appears that some of these buildings (Business, etc) are actually consuming the already limited parking. It is the only downside I have found, but sometimes it is a very big downside for me. Online: Student Renovation of some of the older buildings such as Henry Peters Building and Volker Hall. Online: Student Please improve the parking situation. It's ridiculous. Online: Student PARKING!!!! (rather than taking the parking lots away). Online: Student Parking and infrastructure. Better bus system or more parking. Poor choice in furniture that is ugly and not comfy. Tear down your cinderblock wall on university! Who's idea was that? It's knee high and makes the campus look like the DMZ Online: Student Professional schools Online: Student Parking. Finish the construction. Add a food place to Lister Hill Library. Finish the study rooms. Online: Student Reorganizing curriculum. Ex. Avoid loading multiple heavy courses in one semester. Make better use of first year summer. Etc. Online: Student Parking!!! Also, cheaper options for food in the student center. Online: Student Build parking decks. Online: Student Optometry school pre clinic Online: Student The basic sciences, and development of a stronger graduate program with outside leadership. Online: Student Parking and safety. Online: Student UAB should invest in the city of Birmingham. UAB has it's own transportation system, which is separate from the city of Birmingham itself, in its own way strengthening the segregation that is still prevalent in this city. UAB is the major employer that is bringing people to the city and to the state, and I think that UAB could be doing more to support the city itself. UAB should focus its investments on research and on healthcare. UAB is a medical institution and there are a number of great researchers on campus. However, I think that UAB can do more to integrate its undergraduate and graduate campuses. Many applicants to graduate programs at UAB do not come from UAB undergraduate programs and it seems like a wasted opportunity. Online: Student Parking. More options for dining, especially in the Lister Hill Library. Online: Student In it's classrooms and housing arrangements. These buildings should be remodeled to better fit the day and age the students are learning in. Online: Student Keep going on the path we are on. Continue to expand and continue to improve technology around campus. UAB is already ahead of most schools, make it even better. Make us shine. Make our students and our guests feel as if they are walking into the future as they walk onto campus. Use all possible urban planning techniques to create the most fuctional and automated campus in the nation. Urban planning is a rising field. It is needed to push our cities in the right direction while tackling challenges such as climate change, crime, and poverty. Teach students in civil engineering about urban planning and allow them and their professors to design the best campus in the nation. Online: Student Invest in campus safety, and student amenities. Online: Student Parking Online: Student The updates for all of the buildings. Online: Student Making sure that students feel like they are important, not just a face. Also food. I eat the majority of my food in my room because the food on campus is either mediocre or simply way too expensive. And tapingo is wonderful, but the only convenient way to eat on campus. There are not many places on campus that are good to sit and eat. Online: Student As mentioned above, UAB needs to turn its focus towards building parking decks before any other buildings. The parking situation should be at the top of list as this problem leads many missed classes, parking tickets, missed meetings..etc. Then they need to try and introduce new food options (Taco Bell, Chic-fil-a, Mcdonalds,..etc.) and some decent study areas in the student center. Online: Student 1. PARKING. 2. more upperclassmen dorms (similar to Blount) Online: Student Another parking deck and several more lots. With record sized freshman clases and an ever growing enrollment, parking has already proved an issue and needs to be revised for a long term solution. Online: Student Getting more professors for the biology department and offering more biology class times. The women's bath rooms could use some work. There is no where to put a back pack down and most of the stalls are to small to hang the back pack in comfortably. Also in a lot of the older buildings lots of the stalls do not lock. The newer bath rooms are all automated but it makes them harder to use. Online: Student Parking. Parking. Parking. For the love of God, build a parking deck. For a campus filled with brilliant people, no one has seemed to figure out that adding students and destroying parking lots is a bad idea. Online: Student I believe that UAB should focus its efforts on improving campus and student life. More activities (not only in the first 2 weeks of school...) should be held on the Green. Bringing football back will definitely help with this social aspect. Thank you for asking for students' input! Online: Student they need to have more food places for its students,faculty,and allumii. Because not everyone eats or wants to eat panara bread or full moon all of the time. bring back the food truck that they had at one point. such as burger king,mcdonalds, pizz a hut. Online: Student Invest in a new Urban Studies Research Center. This center capitalizes on UAB's unique urban campus and serves the needs of a growing urban population. Use this research center to bridge the gap between Birmingham city government and the university. We need a better relationship! What problems is Birmingham facing? This center can spear head interdisciplinary solutions and provide students with internships and other service learning opportunities that have a physical impact on the city. Aside from a Director, an Urban Studies Research Center would not require many new resources. Instead, UAB could draw on its many capable professors in the Government, Sociology, Business, and Public Health Departments. Indeed, an ethos of interdisciplinary work on present problems in our own backyard could foster innovation, publicity, and a more unified UAB community. Graduate Research Assistantships are key to recruiting high quality students and providing them with mentor training. These students who achieve academically will improve UAB's reputation in the market. Without these assistantships, UAB will struggle to recruit and graduate high quality students, and thus its reputation in the market will yield a negative feedback cycle. The Social Sciences are part of STEM. Indeed, the Social Sciences are among the best at applying statistics and data analysis to real world problems. To cut Graduate Research Assistantships to the Social Science Departments would hamper UAB's ability to improve its STEM programs. UAB should invest in these assistanships, not cut them! Online: Student Parking. More decks would be amazing. Online: Student The Humanities Building should be top priority. Online: Student 1. Global outreach. To make this university grow bigger and better, the university need to attract good quality students and scholars from abroad. This could be achieved by building partnerships with institutions in developing countries and creating exchange programs with these institutions. 2. The transportation system. Emphasis is often given to parking issues, but transportation of non-motorized students living off-campus is not discussed. Living off campus could be frustrating as public transportation is a nightmare. As a good number of students live in southside Birmingham, I would suggest an extension of the bus routes to this area or scheduled shutters in the morning, the afternoon, and the evening. 3. Family services. I found frustrating that my children were ineligible to attend the UAB child care center. It is very expensive and it is not open to students' children. Addressing this issue will make life easier for students with a family. Online: Student Expanding the classes offered online, both for diploma's and certificates. An area that I've not seen many classes on are for office administration aka secretary, office manager. This could be a certificate program that takes a candidate through basics of computers, increasing typing speed, use of Microsoft office tools. Another focus along these lines are construction office administrators. They'd need the same skills a typical office admin needs, but should be exposed to the acronyms of the industry and CSI codes and where to find the information. Online: Student UAB should focus it's investments on expanding campus restaurants and parking. Additionally, because UAB is a city-centered campus, it would be nice if UAB could invest in safer\/easier routes to popular locations as well as more locations for students to visit\/utilize. Online: Student Parking and infrastructure. Remodel the education building. Make ONE parking pass that everyone can use at a flat rate...not different-priced parking permits. Online: Student I can't advise on this, it is out of my scope of knowledge! Online: Student As previously stated, UAB should greatly focus its investments on the parking infrastructure. If this is not improved, there will be no room to grow and welcome more students. The parking situation has begun to reach dire proportions before destroying entire parking lots. There is no way to expand without fixing this fundamental flaw that someone thought would work itself out. Online: Student Expand the residence halls. Either place one on the green or more preferably, build the current ones higher. On-campus students will help the school since parking is already so limited for commuters. The best option is to expand the residence halls. AC standard WiFi for myresnet would also be nice to bring it to the same standard as UABSECURE.. Online: Student PLEASE focus on making Campbell Hall look nice. This building is not up to par for the research labs it contains. There's no safety shower near my lab, there's a bug problem at least once a semester, the roof leaks occasionally, and the maintenance crew (janitorial and building facilities) doesn't care about what they do. It once took over a month to replace a ceiling tile that had been damaged by the leaking roof. Look at the bathrooms on the second floor by the teaching labs for biology. The doors don't shut, one stall is missing a door. The teaching labs are also deplorable. I would have no pride in the class if I was enrolled. In short: 1. Eliminate staff who don't do their jobs. The building would be in much better condition than it is. 2. Renovate\/rebuild Campbell Hall. It is absolutely pathetic. Look at the Science and Engineering Complex on The University of Alabama's campus. That's how students should be treated who are forking out money to an institution. 3. Fund your graduate students better. The budget for the biology department has been cut every year since I've been here. I can barely afford groceries each month. Thank goodness my parents have the ability to help me out some. Online: Student Parking definitely needs improvement for both students and patients. Students parking at remote lots need to wait maybe 15-30 minutes for a bus to come by to pick them up. Sometimes, it is better to walk for 15 minutes to a building instead of waiting for a bus. Patients, especially in the School of Dentistry, always complain about parking and that they could not find parking around the school. It seems ridiculous that new buildings are being built while parking lots are being sacrificed with so much need for parking on campus. Online: Student, Alumnus Communication and collaborate across the university should be overhauled to reduce duplicating efforts. UAB should better communicate the institution's work to the local public, the broader higher ed community, and policy makers. Key investments should be made for both community relations\/ engagement and local, state, and federal government relations, the system-level office does not seem to represent UAB's interests as well as we could. UAB should also invest in sustainable development programs. Not only in technical areas such as engineering, but in social and political sciences, economic development, public health, etc. Online: Student, Alumnus, Community member Effective professional development throughout university (all schools and colleges, undergraduate and grad\/professional). UAB should develop strong career development programs that prepare grad students & PhDs specifically for non-academic careers, and could be a leader in country as career climate demands this response. UAB should also invest in programs that support underserved students in order to reduce inequality in access and retention. Georgia State has a great model on this. UAB should also invest in smaller schools and colleges such as school of ed and raise quality to meet UAB standards. This could involve creating administrative positions for professional advisors, placement coordinators, etc. whose primary role is to support student success. Online: Student, Community member Expansion of travel infrastructure on campus, focusing on parking capacity. Online: Student, Community member UAB should tear down the humanities building and renovate the BEC once engineering takes it over, because the layout is so archaic. There should be a Chick-Fil-A on campus. UA has 2 and they are all over the city, so why do we we not have one? I would love to spend my required BlazerBucks at Chick-Fil-A on campus. There should be way more here's where you are and here's how you get to where you need to go stations. Campus police should be more visible, especially at night and in the parking decks all the time. UAB baseball should be marketed better whether it's off campus or at Regions Park and the basketball team should play a few big time non-conference games a year at the BJCC. Look at what Avery Johnson is doing at Alabama and that tells you all you need to know about how to market an athletic program. I love UAB and it has helped me a great deal in my career progression up to this point, but there are definitely a lot of areas we can improve in. Online: Student, Community member PARKING!!!!!!!!!!! PARKING x10000000!!! PARKING! Online: Student, Community member 1. Recruitment and retention of more African American males, especially in academia and administration (they exist). 2.

A student should not have to arrive at 7 am in order to get a parking spot that they are not afraid to walk back to after their classes. Online: Student, Faculty, Staff, Alumnus, Parent, Community member on providing a lot more services for its employees. making it mandatory that there should be at least 2 techs over night and during the day. working by yourself ALL the time, is draining and sometimes you need a break. bad thing is, calling out gives you a point. make it so that employees can only call out twice once a month. Online: Student, Faculty, Staff, Parent, Community member n\/a\/ Online: Student, Staff DIVERSITY and inclusion in more than talk but in policy, practice, resources and staff especially for international students, faculty and staff (undocumented as well) and LGBTQ students, faculty and staff, and Muslim or Middle Eastern students Online: Student, Staff Clinical and ER Online: Student, Staff The continued improvement in education and faculty. More importantly, the attention needs to be focused on infrastructure and development of the campus. Satellite lots are a joke and make this place eerily similar to Six Flags or Disney World. Commuters make up a large percentage of the students we are fortunate enough to take tuition and hard earned dollars from. Underground parking decks would allow the beauty to remain while also handling the inefficiencies we currently maintain. The water from rain that manages to travel down could in such a lot could be redispersed to the greenery and trees we are so focused on cultivating. For example look at Belmont University. They are housed within Nashville and maintain a gorgeous campus while still being confined within the city. Online: Student, Staff PARKING PARKING PARKING PARKING Online: Student, Staff Parking. No student should ever \"get\" to campus only to walk 15 mins+ to their class. Invest in underground parking or adding Zyp Stations everywhere with bike paths intertwining campus. Online: Student, Staff See question #2 Online: Student, Staff We need to focus on enhancing our reputation nationally. We also need a health equity office on the medicine side that combines research from SOM and efforts of the DEI office. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus I think UAB should build at least one if not two commuter parking decks. Close to campus. The remote lots are a ridiculous idea. Commuters come and go daily, sometimes multiple times per day. It is ridiculous for residents to be given special parking in the middle of campus, when they rarely move their cars, while commuters are placed far come campus and forced to park in remote lots. It makes NO SENSE. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus Most people do not mind working, however those people should be compensated for their actions. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member Staff development Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member Collaboration among schools on campus. Invest in finding and keeping new faculty who embrace their own investments in collaboration with other schools (like Sarah Parcak). Sustainability in ALL respects: 1) Environmental responsibility, 2) Recycling, 3) Composting of food wastes from the Dining Halls, 4) Bicycling - more and safer!, 5) Green spaces and link one green space to another - Railroad Park, for example. Invest in our students - they are so energetic and intelligent. Find ways to bring them together - art, biology, music, theatre, physics, fraternities and sororities. Each of these student niches has expertise that benefits another group. Real money can be put in to building new buildings, but building communities and cohesiveness will be one of the best investments we can make for progress and successes of UAB. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member Ambulatory areas. Online: Student, Staff, Alumnus, Community member The areas that does not have millions of dollars donations are the ones that I think focus should be in terms of investing. An old adage goes, \"a group\/team is as only as strong as its' weakest link\". The smaller schools and academic departments are serving a very distinctive group of students which adds value to those students. Even if the numbers are small, investing in those areas could help increase enrollment. Online: Student, Staff, Community member Distance Learning in higher degrees. Online: Alumnus Promoting athletics, creating a School of Law, creating an Executive MBA Program. Hiring more employees to answer phones during the first days of each new semester. It is impossible to get through to anyone during the first week of each new semester.

Online: Alumnus Campus design and athletics: excellence in those two will attract top students to UAB! Online: Alumnus UAB needs to focus its investments in improving the schools ability to draw in the best and brightest students and faculty. Improve student housing and campus facilities. Online: Alumnus Athletics and parking. Online: Alumnus An on campus stadium. Fix all the elevators. Save money. Fiscal conservation. Online: Alumnus, Community member Pediatric oncology. Athletics. Business. Engeneering Online: Alumnus, Community member Student led research and design Online: Community member Enhancing academic entities on campus that have been underfunded, poorly supported, and\/or underrepresented in the decision-making process. Reduce the income inequality between faculty and administrators. Reducing procedural barriers. Increase administrative support. Do away with the current budget model which operates a sort of microeconomy. It can be prohibitive for non-STEM fields. For example, faculty receive quotes for services from entities on campus that charge more than outside vendors. Sometimes programs are forced to use the outside vendors because the markup is prohibitively expensive for programs that aren't supported by large grants. This system unfairly favors programs that have access to more research funding or offer a large number of undergraduate courses and\/or majors.

This may mean forgoing a big name recruitment while investing more in the intellectual resources already at the institution.

In-person response from listening sessions Infrastructure. Comparatively we may be weak in Engineering - and I say that cautiously because I'm not in Engineering. In-person response from listening sessions Scholarships for students. Especially for international and out-of-state students. Could out-of state tuition to partially fund in-state scholarships. Most students work and work a bit too much. Full time work and full time students is insane. What is UAB's brand that distinguishes itself from others more than just the climate, etc. In-person response from listening sessions Creation of an endowed chairs on the undergraduate side. It's very lopsided and I understand it's easier for some medically related depts. But very few down on our end [under 5 or under 3]. Often an inducement to get faculty here. Make more concentrated pitches to peple to think about other areas. Supporting undergraduates who are going to be stellar and be the future leaders\/researchers. Very lopsided. In-person response from listening sessions Looik at peer instutions - what do their endowments look like? What funding streams are being used to get those. Lots of universities who don't have medical centers have endowmnets in these non-medical areas. Need to set goals for which departments, how much, etc. Be cautious about matching opportunities. In-person response from listening sessions Match our investments with the anticipated funding streams. If we're relying on undergraduate tuition, then we need to make commensurate investments. It's not about rec centers, etc. it's about teacher\/student ratios. In-person response from listening sessions Family housing? In-person response from listening sessions Where are the funds in the capital campaign going. Need to be more transparent. Where are these things going. Wall of secrecy as to how these funds are being used and what the focus are. In-person response from listening sessions Support our FB by buying season tickets. Student life is improving. In-person response from listening sessions Faculty lounge. Faculty salaries up above SUG average. Long-haul. In-person response from listening sessions Basic building investments to maintain optimal research and teaching In-person response from listening sessions Faculty and staff are same in terms of stresses (finances, structure, inferior buildings). In-person response from listening sessions Inconsistency in paying bills. Accreditation fee and needed a new W9. Crazy things you have to go through. Not efficient. Accounting team seems to be suspicious of faculty. Every year there are new requirements - you think you figure things out, but it changes. Reimbursements don't come easily. Understand there's huge turnover. Doesn't help our stress level. In-person response from listening sessions Benefits office doesn't help easily with retirement benefits answers. I'm not sure why keeps some of these people on staff because they're not friendly or cooperative. Seems that such offices are vital to the university to faculty\/staff\/students. Increasing lack of knowledge that tehey probably should know. Faculty happiness. Very important. In-person response from listening sessions Strange that we think about percentages less than being equal to SUG Averages. In 2008 we lost office personnel and might have gotten used to it. Need local administrative personnel - in our department offices. In-person response from listening sessions Certain classroom control. Reasonably happy with teaching loads - not increased or messed with. People happy with certain local control of things (classroom, equipment, etc.). In-person response from listening sessions Need to concentrate in Latin America. In-person response from listening sessions Bring the other schools up and broaden research portfolio. In-person response from listening sessions Encouraging science education in the k-12 system. Hooks them to come to UAB. CORD program, for example. Would love to see us do more of that. In-person response from listening sessions Public relations to spread the national and international word about UAB. Get our faculty out elsewhere to agencies as rotators. Support faculty fellowships leadership opportunities to do this. In-person response from listening sessions Can we really make the shift from UA to UAB? We can try and there have been good campaigns, but can we really change that. In-person response from listening sessions Sustainability. Be more green in every possible way. Even considering paper as a resource rather than ... There has been a shift, but it can continue. Active composting of food stuff, mouse bedding, Every lightbulb change to LED, Green roofs, solar power. Birmingham as a city could be way more green. State doesn't help, but we can lead the way or succeed in spite of that. In-person response from listening sessions Engineering & Vision Research. But Engineering is still too small. In-person response from listening sessions National name comes from inventions, innovation, renown of faculty. We have a great opportunity to invent and grow R&D. However we have limited collaboration outside of SOM\/BME because limited resources to invest in areas who may not be as financially strong as medical areas. Research leads to inventions\/discovery that returns dividends to UAB that can be reinvested. In-person response from listening sessions When our investigators go out to these meetings, we get our name out. Maybe require our branding on all presentations. Could help the general scientific community to know who we are in separation from other schools. Brand scientific templates for slides\/posters, etc. In-person response from listening sessions Research excellence & growth requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Electronic medical records + Computer science + data analysis, etc. for example. In-person response from listening sessions We're a well-kept secret, but how do we develop a strategy to get more of our distinguished faculty to get into the distinguished clubs. How do we become a player in those clubs? - investing in people who are focused and can make the steps needed to move on - office of faculty development for faculty and student awards. Also think about retention. President's award for X. Researchers luncheon, etc. In-person response from listening sessions In-person response from listening sessions Any push toward OneMedicine, OneHealth? Yes to a degree. Idea of a one-stop health shop (one clinic for Dentistry\/Optometry\/internal med.) In-person response from listening sessions We're really moving in the right direction. Since 1988 we have come so far! So much growth and so many changes. It's been amazing to see the changes. In-person response from listening sessions Free Parking! In-person response from listening sessions Natural preserve like a pond would be nice to bring in more birds\/wildlife. In-person response from listening sessions Pedestrian Safety. Maybe close University Blvd? Divert traffic. Scramble crosswalks. The pedestrian crossing is a good start, but need more. Make ticketing possible for jay walkers and traffic patterns. In-person response from listening sessions Reestablishment of urban studies programs - public administration, economics, sociology, etc. In-person response from listening sessions More investment in sustainable cities. In-person response from listening sessions More resources to mental health. In-person response from listening sessions Continued investment in great student health.

In-person response from listening sessions Service learning courses. In-person response from listening sessions Invest in promotion to local communities like Hoover, Homewood, Vestavia, Mountain Brook. Prospective students in local communities need more information about how good things are at UAB. Many still think UAB is \"how it used to be.\" In-person response from listening sessions the Urban Studies program. Now we have sustainable cities? Could that come back? Might there be a possibility of having an urban program with city government. Getting students more involved in learning about governance and civic engagement. This could be more of a social sciences area and interdisciplinary programs. In-person response from listening sessions Dorms - student housing In-person response from listening sessions Technology In-person response from listening sessions Research infrastructure In-person response from listening sessions QUESTION: Is it always good to build housing to meet enrollment growth? SUGGESTION: Have UAB talk to people around town to give discounts to UAB students\/alumni. Get them closer. Especially when it comes to sporting events\/football. It creates that \"normal\" college experience. In-person response from listening sessions Develop the housing infrastructure to accommodate growing enrollment. In-person response from listening sessions Technology. In-person response from listening sessions Athletics is the hook to alumni. Try to get them to come to the games. Hopefully the stadium will generate that excitement. In-person response from listening sessions Research\/clinics\/hospital? - Seems to me that in some ways, UAB has lost its reputation. Example of the seattle doc recommending UAB as the place to be. In-person response from listening sessions Investment in recruiting world-renowned faculty\/researchers. To have the great facilities and funds (endowments). Retaining. Want to be the best in their area and be supported to do so. Donors to support this. Getting rid of the bureaucracy. In-person response from listening sessions In-person response from listening sessions Diversity in everything. Makes us great now. Could make us greater. In-person response from listening sessions E.g. Metal analogy. Pure metals are not great. When you mix them, they are stronger. In-person response from listening sessions Parking benefits for alumni.

Everyone take more ownership In-person response from listening sessions Support for hospital infrastructure. Seems like campus has a lot of new buildings and areas being created. Hospital has some old buildings. In-person response from listening sessions Focus on employee development. We have the office of OL&D, but making sure that's accessible regardless of what unit they're in (maintenance, etc.). Customer service - internal and external. Going to 6 different places is unacceptable. Better communication between units. Knowing what each unit does. In-person response from listening sessions Buildings, people, infrastructure, restaurants bars college area feel, In-person response from listening sessions Employee development - it's the line managers responsibility to also help develop people. Give them feedback and opportunities to grow. In-person response from listening sessions Cybersecurity - don't run the risk of being compromised and having a black eye in the public. In-person response from listening sessions More cohesive with the city with who maintains the streets and lights. Lights in the mini park are still out. Is this campus or is this city? Passing the buck, but nothing happens in a timely fashion. In-person response from listening sessions Ownership at the institutional and individual levels. All of us take responsibility to make UAB better to be the best place it can be. Model the behaviours we want to see. In-person response from listening sessions Identify who we serve and serve them better. How we're serving our people. In-person response from listening sessions Be more transparent in how we do business on a daily basis. Share those processes with folks. Be on the same team. In-person response from listening sessions Ways to communicate what benefits we get for Employees. Part of Employee orientation. Help us share how good we are. In-person response from listening sessions Share our benefits. In-person response from listening sessions Food scene but is it accessible. In-person response from listening sessions Retention question was asked. In-person response from listening sessions When I graduated high school I didn't know it was UAB.

In-person response from listening sessions Community relationships. In-person response from listening sessions More service learning classes when you're taking your major courses. In-person response from listening sessions Maker space seems untouchable\/unuseable. Needs to be multidisciplinary, cross disciplinary learning. E.g. sustainability students working with Engineering to innovate. Intentionality of creating experiences that are meaningful ways to build skills and put theory into practice. In-person response from listening sessions Technology and innovation and entrepreneurship. In-person response from listening sessions Alumni relations.

In-person response from listening sessions Student life to create an engaging experience that keeps students here and keeps them giving back. In-person response from listening sessions Beautification. More art. Students contributing to the beautification and improvement of campus and the city. In-person response from listening sessions Maybe using artwork as visual evidence of campus culture. In-person response from listening sessions Large trees that provide shade on the green. More than just on the perimeter. In-person response from listening sessions Service work for MLK day didn't include actual work into the city. Focus our efforts into our downtown BHM. In-person response from listening sessions Freshman classes that are required (core). Definite opportunity to integrate civil Rights into our FYE or core curriculum.

In-person response from listening sessions Maybe more of an Athletic presence - maybe not team sports, but have students to have some athletic. In-person response from listening sessions Help with HR and the processing communicating with people we're trying to hire. People who have been fired from the university but then allowed to apply for other areas, but the hiring unit wasn't known about the firing. Not the best processes there - the volume is high, we realize that, but they're swamped. Throughput\/improving the system. In-person response from listening sessions Parking. Employees pay $50\/month- is it worth it? Could there be a tiered level of parking payments? More for closer. It's a lot out of an entry level persons paycheck. In-person response from listening sessions If we continue to grow our student population - need to look at the physical and human infrastructure to know that we can accommodate that growth. We want to be ready to receive them and help them be successful. In-person response from listening sessions Be sure to continue our exceptional services with the growth we're going to have. In-person response from listening sessions Supporting student completion\/graduation\/ retention. In-person response from listening sessions Investment in resources to help our students.

In-person response from listening sessions Apply for a grant to help with professional development for units that are small and unable to financially afford such programming. In-person response from listening sessions Gap funding for students to close the gap between what they need to cover and what they're able to cover. Increasing the opportunity for people to work on campus rather than off campus. Students who are eligible to be here, we invest in them so that finances are not the issue keeping them from being successful. In-person response from listening sessions HR needs to be looked at and be restructured in some way. People don't trust HR when there are issues. Big barriers there.

Producing graduates who are ready to take on the jobs that are needed here and elsewhere. Producing the graduates who will be the leaders in the future. Project those industry sectors 20 years out. Don't invest in areas that may be \"dying.\" Cybersecurity for example. In-person response from listening sessions People don't know all the great things going on. Know this is a great medical university. What other things are we doing well. In-person response from listening sessions Embrace the fact that we are not a \"traditional\" campus and that we are in the city - think about how NYU or Boston are doing it. Marry city and traditional. Embrace the resource that is the city. In-person response from listening sessions How cool would it be for UAB to have its own downtown on campus. In-person response from listening sessions Sever ties with the UA System and be independent self. In-person response from listening sessions Our value within the city and region is being more realized. Good education. Well respected. Driving up university blvd. is impressive. Look at individual schools and see what's on the edge of elite? Which are subpar? Are physical investments going to drive things forward? Or is it the recruitment of new talent - global leaders and then the facilities follow. Improving the \"product\" helps to build on things. In-person response from listening sessions I would love to incorporate traffic lights to be able to turn left along university Blvd. smarter crosswalk signals. Texting apps. In-person response from listening sessions On campus stadium would be ideal. Uptown may be a better option. Needs to be a line in the sand on when to decide to progress with our own plan rather than relying on other things to drive us. In-person response from listening sessions Would be neat to have UAB logos down the street, in intersections, etc. like in 5 points. Does it make sense there any more?

In-person response from listening sessions Space of the School of Dentistry is limited and limiting our growth. In-person response from listening sessions Interprofessional education block collaborative practice model could be a real win for UAB. In-person response from listening sessions Grow the building for Dentistry across 7th Ave. S. In-person response from listening sessions Can't measure dentistry success by CHP alone. Same for all other professional schools, including medicine. In-person response from listening sessions New Art Building.

It's not comparable to other worldwide universities. 2nd. In-person response from listening sessions University should invest more to undergraduate scholarships. In-person response from listening sessions Libraries. 2nd floor INTO move is appalling. We had no say in that move. Generally the libraries should be the heartbeat of the campus. In-person response from listening sessions Don't' realize how good a library is until you don't have one. Combine the libraries physically. Economies of scale. Not sure why there's two libraries. In-person response from listening sessions More open hours for the library during the semesters. In-person response from listening sessions Abandon or greatly modify RCM.
