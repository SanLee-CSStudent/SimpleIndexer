The Krulak institute promotes and supports experiential learning at BSC. Experiential learning invites students to integrate classroom knowledge with real-world experiences. Internships, community service-learning, study abroad, and undergraduate research with a faculty member, for example, all require students to integrate what they know with what they do. Through thoughtful, critical reflection, students involved in experiential learning gain insight into who they are and who they want to be: as future professionals, as lifelong learners, and as engaged citizens.
