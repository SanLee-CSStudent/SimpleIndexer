There are four ways students can take advantage of PLA at CBC: Students may submit a portfolio that demonstrates credit-worthy mastery of a subject and submit to CAEL. Take a subject-specific examination from CLEP, DSST, or through high school Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate programs. Transfer prior earned college credits from accredited colleges for course substitutions at CBC. Apply for non-standard learning credits from the American Council on Education (ACE), an umbrella organization that reviews courses for their educational standards.
