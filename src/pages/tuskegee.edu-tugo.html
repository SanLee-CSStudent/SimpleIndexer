TUGO Tuskegee University Global Office (TUGO) Mission The Tuskegee University Global Office was established to infuse an international dimension throughout Tuskegee University's programs of instruction, research and extension. The goal of Tuskegee University's participation in international development activities is to develop an effective and responsive international program within the context of the university ?s land grant mission.

The impact for global learning is now. Learning about the world, especially as it relates to improving our country 's strategic advantage has become an important national security concern. Committed educators have long known that learning about the world and about the interrelationships among national, international and global issues is indispensable to a high quality education. An Overview Tuskegee University has accumulated a breadth and depth of experiences and skills in international development, based on extensive work in Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean. The University has historically committed faculty and institutional capabilities to working with developing countries, to affect human resource development, economic policy changes, institutional development and technology transfer through the design and implementation of projects. Tuskegee University has amassed a cadre of highly trained scientists and professionals on various fields. Our Purpose The need for administrators, faculty, staff and students to have an understanding of other nations, other cultures, literature, modes of thinking and languages is urgent. By helping our students to comprehend the complexities and subtleties of the environment, the University can make a special contribution to meeting this national need. The Tuskegee University Global Office has a responsibility to internationalize the Tuskegee University campus. International students do a lot to bring cultural diversity to our campus, but we need more. The Global Office is assisting the University in meeting these needs through international development activities. This includes international research and development, technical assistance, international training and study abroad. Tuskegee allows its faculty and staff to provide technical assistance and to collaborate with developing countries and research institutes on research projects in most areas of strength at the University.
