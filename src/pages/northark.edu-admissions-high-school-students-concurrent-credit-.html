Students who are in grades nine through twelve may enroll concurrently for college courses. Northark considers those students who have successfully completed the eighth grade and who have not graduated from high school as eligible students. Concurrently enrolled students must meet these criteria: 1. The student must have completed the eighth grade and be enrolled in a secondary school or home school. 2. The student must complete an application for admission and provide qualifying test scores (ACCUPLACER or ACT). Home-schooled students must also provide a copy of the Notification of Intent to Home School Form, which is on file with the local school district. Only students who are qualified and enrolled in the college course may attend the course; high school students cannot attend a college course to receive only high school credit. North Arkansas College may stipulate additional qualifications for admission to concurrent student status. Northark Concurrent Enrollment Program staff will determine concurrent student placement, score attainment, and eligibility at the time of registration. A concurrently enrolled student will be classified as non-degree seeking. A concurrently enrolled student may not enroll for more than nine semester hours during any semester exclusive of courses taken at the high school campus or secondary center during regular school hours. Exceptions may be made by the high school administration in collaboration with Concurrent Enrollment program staff. Students enrolled concurrently must maintain a cumulative 2.00 GPA each semester of Northark enrollment. Students failing to achieve a 2.00 semester GPA will be placed on academic probation for the following semester if the cumulative GPA falls below 2.00. Students will remain on academic probation as long as their semester GPA is 2.00 or higher and their cumulative GPA is less than 2.00. Students will be placed on academic suspension if, while on academic probation, they fail to achieve a 2.00 semester GPA and the cumulative GPA continues to be less than 2.00 Students may not re-enroll at Northark until classified as degree-seeking, typically following high school graduation or completion of a GED credential. Exceptions will require the approval of the Academic Leadership and Student Success Team. All arrangements of third party payment of tuition and fees are the responsibility of the student.
