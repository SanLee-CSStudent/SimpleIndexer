Ouachita is a nationally ranked liberal arts university, recently named the top private college in Arkansas by Niche.com. Our fully residential campus is located in the quaint town of Arkadelphia, Arkansas. As a leading Christian university, Ouachita combines a solid academic reputation with a close-knit campus community. This provides a setting where students thrive academically, spiritually, and personally. Ouachita currently has 30 countries represented on campus. Each day, flags fly in the International Flag Plaza, celebrating the different nationalities and backgrounds on campus. Our campus is deeply enriched because of the presence of international students and third culture kids. How do you say \"Ouachita?\" Ouachita is pronounced \u201Cwash-i-tah\u201D and is a Native American word referring to one of the tribes that formerly inhabited Arkansas. The beautiful Ouachita River runs right behind our campus, and the Ouachita Mountains and Lake Ouachita are a short hour\u2019s drive away. Where is Arkadelphia, Arkansas? Arkansas is located in the southeastern part of the United States. Nicknamed \u201Cthe Natural State\u201D because of the beautiful landscape. Rivers, lakes, hiking trails and other outdoor adventures abound. The Ouachita River runs behind campus, and crystal clear Lake Degray is a mere 20-minute drive away! Ouachita has a great Outdoor Recreation program that provides students with inexpensive expeditions to local places of natural beauty. Experience warm Southern hospitality in the heartland of the United States here in Arkadelphia. Benefit from being in a place where locals are interested in getting to know about you and your home as they share their lives with you. Is Safety a priority? For parents sending their students to study far away from home, safety is often a concern. Ouachita was ranked one of the top 40 safest college campuses in all of the United States. Ouachita has a full-time security team in place whose focus is on maintaining the safety of our students, faculty and staff at all times. They are professional law enforcement officers who regularly implement trainings for the campus community. Ouachita is a small campus where the distance from the dorms to classrooms is easily walkable. The surrounding community warmly embraces Ouachita students and is happy for the university\u2019s influence in the town. What should I expect with \u201CBaptist\u201D being part of the name of the university? Most private universities in the United States were founded by different Christian denominations, including the majority of the Ivy League institutions. Over time, some of these universities have moved away from their denominational affiliations while others have remained closely connected. Ouachita Baptist University was founded in 1886 in collaboration with the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Since then, Ouachita has remained closely connected with Arkansas Baptist State Convention and upholds a theology considered interdenominational and mainline evangelical in nature. Ouachita remains committed to her roots as a private Christian liberal arts institution and approaches education through a distinctly Christian lens. All students complete two Bible classes as a part of the core curriculum. Students are also required to attend a weekly chapel session, which focuses on spiritual, cultural and community issues. While Ouachita remains distinctly Christian, students from a variety of denominations and other faith traditions \u2013 including no faith background \u2013 are welcome. Ouachita\u2019s department of communications offers unlimited career and community-building. The smaller class sizes and specialized programs create an environment where meaningful instruction and hands-on experience merge, equipping students with the skills needed to thrive in the workplace. During my time there, I was able to pursue my passion for communications in a variety of ways, from writing for the Ouachita News Bureau to working on a social media communications campaign that reached audiences nationwide to serving as a summer intern for a Christian news publication. Most importantly, I was able to participate in and learn from a body of students and faculty who respect, encourage and empower one another.
