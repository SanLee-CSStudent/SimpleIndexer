Choirs from Urdd Gobaith Cymru in Wales and the University of Alabama at Birmingham will finally perform together in person, Monday, April 18, after their travel and festival performance plans were delayed by the pandemic. In May 2020, the UAB Gospel Choir was invited to be the featured choir at the Urdd National Eisteddfod choir competition in Wales; then, the UAB College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 Department of Music was set to host the winning Welsh choir the following year. Due to COVID-19 travel precautions, those plans were canceled. Now C?r yr Urdd \u2014 a national collegiate choir from Wales \u2014 will come to Birmingham to perform with the UAB Gospel Choir for a concert at 7 p.m. Monday, April 18, at UAB\u2019s Alys Stephens Performing Arts Center. Tickets are $10; free for students. For tickets, call 205-975-2787 or visit AlysStephens.org. The C?r yr Urdd will also perform at 16th Street Baptist Church and tour civil rights sites in the city. \u201CThis is one of many things we have recently been able to reclaim from the pandemic, like our all-department PRISM concert and our concerto winners\u2019 concert with the Alabama Symphony Orchestra,\u201D said Department of Music Chair Patrick Evans, D.M. \u201CWe are delighted to be able to host these students, show them the history of Birmingham and join with them in song with an in-person audience.\u201D The UAB Gospel Choir is scheduled to be the featured choir at the festival in Wales in 2023. Through the partnership, Urdd members are learning more about the gospel singing tradition and experience of being part of a real gospel choir. Singing in Welsh for the first time was a challenge for the UAB Gospel Choir members; however, they embraced it and look forward to visiting Wales, Evans says. Wales, known as the land of song, has an unequivocal strong and longstanding history with music. Urdd Gobaith Cymru is a national voluntary youth organization in Wales, United Kingdom, with more than 55,000 members between the ages of 8 and 25 years. Since its establishment in 1922 \u2014 to give children and young people in Wales opportunities to learn and socialize in Welsh \u2014 the Urdd has nurtured more than 4 million young people. back to top More News UAB Experts Featured Video See more from UAB Visual Content Tweets by UABNews Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator University Relations UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | ? 2022 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Opportunity\/Affirmative Action Employer committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and family-friendly environment in which all faculty and staff can excel and achieve work\/life balance irrespective of race, national origin, age, genetic or family medical history, gender, faith, gender identity and expression as well as sexual orientation.
