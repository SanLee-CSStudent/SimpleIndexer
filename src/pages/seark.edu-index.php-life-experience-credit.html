Validated nontraditional education experiences (i.e., work experience, industry training) may be recognized by Southeast Arkansas College if a student enrolls in Portfolio Development and Experience Evaluation (TECH 2011). Military training experience is evaluated for equivalent college credit through the use of a nationally standardized system. Credit is awarded for technical courses only and can be used to fulfill requirements toward an Associate of Applied Science degree, Technical Certificate or Certificate of Proficiency. The SEARK College transcript will record an \u201CS\u201D for credit earned in this manner and is NOT considered transferable. Up to 15 credit hours may be awarded if the portfolio meets the same level of learning that would have occurred had the student taken the same courses at Southeast Arkansas College. Credit is awarded upon approval of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Credit will be applied to the student\u2019s transcript once they have earned fifteen semester credit hours through traditional classes. TECH 2011 Portfolio Development & Experience Evaluation 1 Cr., (1 Lec.)

Students will identify the courses for which they feel qualified to receive credit and develop written portfolios to demonstrate that they have met the course objectives. Students can earn up to 15 credit hours through non-traditional educational sources. Credit will be applied to the student\u2019s transcript once they have earned fifteen semester credit hours through traditional classes.
