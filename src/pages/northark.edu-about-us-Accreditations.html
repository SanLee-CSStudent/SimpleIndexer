Northark moved from a traditional model of accreditation to AQIP, a quality-based continuous improvement model of accreditation through the Higher Learning Commission. The program incorporates a review process designed to deliver clear, concrete and efficient feedback to participating institutions. Northark is dedicated to having three ongoing Action Projects focused on student learning. The college also provides annual updates about the progress of the projects, completes a comprehensive Systems Portfolio every four years and expects a site visit from an AQIP team every seven years.
