As a land-grant institution, Auburn has a special legacy in serving the community beyond campus through Outreach. For more than a century, Auburn University's outreach and engagement mission has been partnering with communities, businesses, schools and government to help people meet their educational goals and to improve quality of life all across our state. Simply put, through Engagement, we Instruct, we Assist, and we Serve: University Outreach engages with communities in partnership and reciprocity for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge that promotes the common good. Engagement promotes greater accessibility to Auburn\u2019s educational resources \u2013 especially to those in underserved areas \u2013 while enriching scholarship, learning and service for our faculty, staff and students working with the community. University Outreach provides educational opportunities for all ages, including summer academic camps and college preparatory programs for youth, professional and job training courses for working adults, and lifelong learning programs for seniors. University Outreach provides technical and strategic assistance to public and private entities, businesses, schools, governments and civic organizations, to solve problems, improve systems, and encourage innovation. Outreach also assists citizens through programs that promote health, well-being and community sustainability. University Outreach promotes public service through an array of activities, events, exhibitions and other offerings that encourage community involvement and enhance quality of life. The Division of University Outreach is led by the Office of the Vice President for University Outreach and is comprised of eight specialized centers, institutes and offices which provide a range of programs and services available to the public. Auburn also actively engages its faculty and students in the Outreach mission through service-learning courses and community-based projects in the university\u2019s academic programs. This website contains a directory of our University Outreach offices as well as a helpful directory of faculty contacts university-wide. Your suggestions, comments, and questions are always welcome at outreach@auburn.edu. Please don't hesitate to contact us. Together, we can make a difference!
