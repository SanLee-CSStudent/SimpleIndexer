Maggie Tucker and Allison Ciamarra are the current VMASC success coaches. How much does success coaching cost? Coaching is FREE and unlimited for all currently enrolled UAB students. How often will I meet with a coach? If a student voluntarily seeks academic coaching, they are not required to meet any specific number of times. However, students who meet three or more times are more likely to experience the best results from the coaching experience. You and your coach will design an individualized plan to determine how often you will meet. A student could meet with their coach biweekly, once a month, three times in a semester, etc. How do I make the most of my coaching appointments? Before your Appointment Check your UAB email for any communication you may have missed from your coach. Consider checking out our coaching staff page to learn more about your coach. List the topics you would like to discuss and any questions you have for your coach. Examples include: Setting S.M.A.R.T. goals and creating an action plan to meet those goals. Creating a time management system that works for you. Identifying learning and studying techniques that are most effective for you. Trying new reading or note-taking strategies During your Appointment Be open and honest with your coach. Take detailed notes. Ask thoughtful questions. Remember that coaching is about what you need. If you feel the conversation is not helpful or going the direction you need, be sure to ask the coach to re-direct the conversation to what is most helpful for you. Schedule a follow up appointment if appropriate. After your Appointment Spend some time reviewing your notes. Work on the action items agreed upon with your coach. Check-in with yourself and ask these questions: What progress have you made? If you feel stuck, what has not gone according to plan and why? Consider other resources you may benefit from besides coaching to support your academic and personal goals (i.e. Tutoring, Supplemental Instruction, Counseling). Always feel free to contact your coach with any follow up questions you may have. Do I have to be failing to receive academic coaching? No. While some students may be required to attend coaching as a result of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), success coaching is open to all UAB students who would like to improve their academic and personal success.
