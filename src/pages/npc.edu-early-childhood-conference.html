BREAKOUT SESSION TWO FEATURING: Kim Avery \u2013 Northland Pioneer College Adjunct Faculty and Kindergarten Teacher The Importance of Outdoor Learning Environments Kim Avery By utilizing outdoor spaces, we give children the chance to explore and interact with the natural world bringing new meaning, relevance, and inspiration to learning. In addition to new opportunities to explore language, math, and science concepts, time outdoors will help develop vital brain functions, increase movement and gross motor skills, and aid in promoting healthy lifestyles. In this session, we will learn why we must get children outside, some basics for setting up meaningful outdoor learning spaces, as well as tips to prepare for all seasons and weather.
