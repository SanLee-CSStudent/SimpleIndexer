Students and visitors will be screened, wear masks, practice social distancing will be practiced, and everyone should clean study and work spaces after use. Governor Hutchison has reduced the mask mandate to a guideline in all public places. However cities, schools, and businesses can still require masks. As part of the University of Arkansas, PCCUA will continue safety protocols outlined in our Covid Plan for the safety of our students and employees. Faculty & student monitoring will continue each day when entering the classroom area. Faculty & student must be free of ANY symptoms related to COVID-19 prior to coming on campus. Social distancing will be practiced at all times. Stay at least 6 feet (about two arms\u2019 length) from other people. This is 3 ft. If all parties are vaccinated. No large gatherings are allowed other than class meetings. All individuals in classrooms (common workplaces, hallways, meeting rooms, classrooms, break-rooms, restrooms, etc.) must wear face masks\/coverings. If more than one person is in a room, a face mask should be worn unless all individuals have been vaccinated. For more information go to the Arkansas Department of Health Coronavirus page. http:\/\/healthy.arkansas.gov\/programs-services\/topics\/novel-coronavirus If you have been fully vaccinated: You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask. You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from one other household (for example, visiting with relatives who all live together) without masks, unless any of those people or anyone they live with has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. If you\u2019ve been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms. However, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms What Has Not Changed For now, if you\u2019ve been fully vaccinated: You should still take steps to protect yourself and others in many situations, like wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces. Take these precautions whenever you are: In public Gathering with unvaccinated people from more than one other household Visiting with an unvaccinated person who is at increased risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 or who lives with a person at increased risk You should still avoid medium or large-sized gatherings. You should still delay domestic and international travel. If you do travel, you\u2019ll still need to follow CDC requirements and recommendations. You should still watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, especially if you\u2019ve been around someone who is sick. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested and stay home and away from others. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/vaccines\/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html 3\/11\/2021 Guidelines from CDC, adopted by the Arkansas Department of Health What is the College doing to disinfect public areas like classrooms and restrooms? The disinfecting of common\/public areas and surfaces is part of PCCUA\u2019s regular routine throughout all campuses. Specifically, classrooms, high traffic touchpoints and bathrooms are disinfected daily. Routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces with a disinfectant is a best practice measure for prevention of viral respiratory illnesses. Is the College preparing contingency plans? PCCUA\u2019s leadership is developing contingency plans to limit the impact to college operations should the need arise. These plans include the College\u2019s readiness to conduct online classes or require additional course work assignments. PCCUA will try to minimize the impact to student learning while ensuring students and employees, who may become ill, can be properly supported as they recover and limit the spread of the virus on our campuses. Is it safe to travel in the U.S.? Please exercise caution and check for the latest information available for your specific destination as the Coronavirus situation in the U.S. is changing rapidly. While the CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to destinations with level 1 travel notices (this currently includes domestic travel in the U.S.) because the risk of transmission is considered low, some areas are reporting increasing levels local transmission. What should I consider when planning personal travel? Consider method of transportation for all travel. Air travel, for example, tends to be crowded with people in close proximity in the plane and the airport. Traveling in a personal vehicle to a destination, would limit exposure to crowds. International Travel We strongly discourage personal international travel, especially to countries with a CDC risk level for Coronavirus of 2 or higher. Please consider the health risk and logistical challenges that may be encountered including that the Arkansas Department of Health may require self-isolation for 14 days after traveling to or through an affected area. Customs agents are reporting international travelers arriving from affected countries to state departments of health for this purpose. Domestic Travel Please exercise caution and check for the latest information available for your specific destination as the coronavirus situation in the U.S. is changing rapidly. While the CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to destinations with level 1 travel notices (this currently includes domestic travel in the U.S.) because the risk of transmission is considered low, some areas are reporting increasing levels of local transmission.
