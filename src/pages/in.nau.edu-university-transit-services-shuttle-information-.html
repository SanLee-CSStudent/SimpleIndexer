During the academic year when classes are in session, we offer two daytime routes, Louie and Jacks; and an evening route, AXELite. Click for a printable shuttle map. Campus shuttles do not operate during university recognized holidays and university closures. Through our partnership with NAIPTA, however, Mountain Link operates during most of these times. During spring, summer and winter breaks, the AXELite is the only route and operates 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Buses depart south campus on the hour and half hour. On Commencement days, regular services are suspended as campus shuttle provides services from P62 and the San Francisco garage to the Skydome. Live GPS tracking of the campus shuttle service is available on the AXExpress Shuttle Tracker or via the NAU mobile app. Transportation Fee The transportation fee covers a portion of the operating costs to provide shuttle services and other transportation related expenses (bike lockers, bike registration, pedestrian\/ bike path signage and improvements). The fee is charged to Flagstaff campus students. Students who purchase a parking permit, after the charge has been posted, will be credited the fee up until mid- term of the semester. Students assigned student teaching, an internship or study abroad, or are online students living more than 50 miles away will be returned the fee if they submit the Transportation Fee Waiver Form to Parking and Shuttle Services by the end of the fifth week each semester, fall or spring.
