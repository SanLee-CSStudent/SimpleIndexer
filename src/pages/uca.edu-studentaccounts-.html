We strive to offer the best possible service consistent with policies and regulations. We provide information, assistance, and education to students and parents so that they can fully understand the cost of attending the University, the dates when these costs are due, and the methods of paying the costs. In addition, we provide documentation and invoice certain third party agencies who have committed to providing cost assistance to students for their education. We also provide information, assistance, and education to campus departments regarding daily deposits for money collected in their areas. Specific information can be accessed via personal contact, myUCA, CashNet, the student handbook, the undergraduate and graduate bulletins, and invoices.
