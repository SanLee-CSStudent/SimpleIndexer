It is a standardized form that is designed to simplify the information that students receive about costs and financial aid. The shopping sheet generates figures that are estimates only and all tuition rates and fees are subject to change without notice. Calhoun Community College\u2019s standard allowance for some expenses may not match your actual costs. Additionally, the shopping sheet does not include any estimates for expenses that may vary greatly based upon personal choices. The shopping sheet does not include some fees that are course-specific (e.g., lab fees, educational materials, art supplies, etc.). All amounts shown on the shopping sheet or in other publications or websites represent tuition and fees as currently approved by the college. However, Calhoun Community College reserves the right to modify tuition rates and fees without prior notice and to make such modifications applicable to students currently enrolled at the college, as well as to incoming students. Students are responsible for all charges billed by the college. The estimates included in the shopping sheet are not binding on the Secretary of Education, Calhoun Community College, the Alabama Community College System or the State of Alabama.
