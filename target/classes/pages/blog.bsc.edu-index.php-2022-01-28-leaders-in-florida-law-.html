And they were right. Donlon and Bates began their roles as chair and chair-elect, respectively, of the Florida Bar Business Law Section in June 2021. Both are amazed that two BSC graduates would end up working together outside of Alabama. Donlon, partner at Johnson, Cassidy, Newlon & DeCort in Tampa, and Bates, shareholder at Clark Partington in Pensacola, are both longtime members of the business law section, a nearly 5,000-member organization that allows Florida attorneys to discuss and change state legislation relating to business. \u201CWe work to advance legislation,\u201D Donlon says. \u201CMembers have been involved in revising the corporation section of the Florida statutes and the LLC statutes, and we have other issues on the table this year that we\u2019ll be working on to get legislation passed. It\u2019s amazing to see the results that our section gets from the hard work of our members.\u201D For more than 20 years, Donlon has practiced law in Tampa, where she first moved after earning her law degree from the Washington and Lee University School of Law. (She and several other BSC alums, including Tamara Dickerson \u201989, Rima Fawal Hartman \u201990, Joelle James Phillps \u201989, and Brant Phillips \u201991, all ended up at Washington and Lee around the same time.) Donlon\u2019s interest in law followed her international undergraduate and post-grad experiences, many of which were supported by her McWane Scholarship from BSC. Contracting her major in international business, Donlon spent all four January interims away and abroad \u2013 she interned in D.C. her first year and later traveled to Australia, New Zealand, China, and Egypt. She also earned a scholarship from the Ensley Rotary Club to study management, economics, and politics at the University of St. Andrews in St. Andrews, Scotland. As a law student, Donlon clerked for District Judge Seybourn Lynne and clerked at Maynard Cooper & Gale, working with attorneys focused on securities litigation and insurance sales practices litigation. This work experience led her to become the securities editor for her program\u2019s law review, and she continues to focus on securities and commercial litigation. Like Donlon, Bates also studied business at BSC, and he says he always uses his business administration degree as an attorney and in the business law section. He earned his law degree from the University of Florida College of Law and has practiced with focus on litigation and insolvency in his hometown of Pensacola for eight years \u2013 only a few blocks down from his father\u2019s law office. \u201CIn the Birmingham-Southern baseball media guide in 2000, I said that I wanted to follow my dad\u2019s footsteps and be a lawyer,\u201D Bates says. \u201CAs someone who took BA 499 during my interim, I now get a chance to take the law and apply it to business to marry up my degrees.\u201D Though they live in different parts of the state, Donlon and Bates got to know each other through their active involvement in the business law section. \u201CThe section gives you assets and friends all over the state,\u201D Donlon says, \u201Cfrom Doug in Pensacola to attorneys in Jacksonville, Orlando, Miami, and Naples. When you need help or need to refer a client, it\u2019s nice to know you have somebody.\u201D As president of the organization, Donlon plans organization-wide meetings, which have currently returned to in-person events after two years of virtual meetings. All standing committees, substantive committees, and task forces meet during these events, and members hear updates on committee work. Donlon is also in charge of the destination and planning of the section\u2019s spring retreat, which will be held in Ireland this year. She is looking forward to traveling with other members again and bringing back the social aspects of the organization that were missing with virtual meetings. \u201CKacy is a wonderful leader,\u201D Bates says. \u201CI\u2019m thrilled to work in this supportive role with her.\u201D Bates, in his position as chair-elect, supports Donlon\u2019s work and initiatives until he takes on the position in summer 2022 at the end of the bar year. In his time with the section, he has taught classes and worked on legislation related to financial literacy, something he will continue to emphasize. \u201CFinancial literacy in the state of Florida \u2013 both at the educational level and in other forms \u2013 is something the business law section has focused on extensively for many years,\u201D Bates says. \u201CWe have put many programs in place in Florida schools and have passed legislation relating to financial literacy curriculum.\u201D When they first joined the section, Bates was still in law school \u2013 his father was an active member and served as the section\u2019s chair 25 years ago \u2013 and Donlon was new to Tampa and early in her practice. Their interests in business and hard work in their committees soon grew to multiple leadership positions throughout their membership. \u201CThere are always opportunities in bar work to get involved and raise your hand,\u201D Donlon says. \u201CAs a young associate, I went to different committee meetings and, within a couple years, I was chair of a committee. If you do good work, you keep moving up to different slots.\u201D Both Donlon and Bates appreciate their time on the Hilltop and often see the ways it impacts their work as they continue to grow their practices and step up as leaders in their state. \u201CIt\u2019s outside of the state of Alabama, too, that BSC graduates are making things happen,\u201D Donlon says.
