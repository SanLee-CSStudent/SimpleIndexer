Please note, Birmingham-Southern College values the educational and developmental environment created for students when they not only learn together in our classrooms, but also live together in our residential areas. Independence, relationship maturity, strengthened social skills, and appreciation for others with whom they share community areas are only a few of the positive outcomes from living with their peers. To promote this essential experience for all BSC students, all first-year students enrolling in the Fall 2022 and beyond will be required to live on campus as a residential student for at least three years. Admitted students may request to commute through submitting a Request to Commute Form. Requests will be reviewed by a committee and responded to on an ongoing basis. It is important to note that financial aid packages are generated based on being a residential student. Should a student be approved to have commuter status, financial aid may be impacted with reduced funding. Requests to be classified as a commuter student will be reviewed by the Commuter Request Committee based on the following criteria: Distance from campus Financial hardship Family circumstances Students who enroll and are already 21 years of age Other relevant factors Future Students Current Students Alumni Parents & Family Faculty & Staff Give to BSC Degrees & Programs Directory Campus Map Careers at BSC Calendar Emergency Information Privacy Policy Non-Discrimination Policy Need Help?
