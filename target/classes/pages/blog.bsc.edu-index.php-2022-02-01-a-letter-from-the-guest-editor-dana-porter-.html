The course reflected a \u201Clearning by doing\u201D approach and was an introduction to the craft of acting, with focus on clarity and creativity in communication and performance skills, and the development of character analysis skills. Students learned basic acting principles, presented scene work with partners, and journaled progress throughout the semester. At the end of the course, we were given an assignment to write a final paper, titled: \u201CMy Growth as an Actor.\u201D As most new, na?ve students do, I waited until the last minute and joined the other procrastinators in the computer lab to put my thoughts together in hopes that my professor would see past a last-minute, hammered-out composition and praise my efforts with a moderate score that would satisfy both my ego and my professor\u2019s lesson plans. When my work was returned to me, there was a clear message from my professor written across the top of my paper: \u201CNice attempt at an essay.\u201D I don\u2019t remember the letter grade I made on that disastrous essay. But to this day, I can still see the handwritten words written across the top of my three-page paper. At the time I was embarrassed, and a bit shocked that he even cared enough to call me out on my lackluster efforts. What I didn\u2019t know at the time is that he was sending me a message as I began my journey at BSC. A message about rising to the challenge, doing better. Two years later, I found myself back in Beginning Acting class \u2013 this time as his Teaching Assistant. Little did I know, Theatre 120 wasn\u2019t finite. This course didn\u2019t particularly have a start and an end for me. It was just one lesson in a long series of lessons, and ultimately nudged and pushed me into a trajectory that I\u2019m still growing into today. Over the past twenty years, I\u2019ve had a successful career teaching theatre to young actors locally, all while honing my skills as a performer on stages from Carnegie Hall to Hong Kong. And you know what? That professor has been there for me the whole time. Because what started as a student\/teacher relationship, evolved into a mentorship. And not only has this professor helped me grow as actor; more importantly, he has guided my growth as a person. Which appears to be a regular theme on the Hilltop. Two months ago, I started a new role as a staff member at Birmingham-Southern. And in my first few weeks I sat down in the cafeteria and enjoyed coffee and conversation with my friend and colleague \u2013 my former professor \u2013 Alan Litsey. We talked about theatre. We talked about work. We talked about life. I wanted to follow him to the classroom and soak up discussion about Theatre as Human Rights Activism with his current students. But instead, I returned to my office. Where I find myself once again reflecting on my growth. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Dana Porter \u201903 (MPPM \u201911) returned to the Hilltop in June 2021 as the assistant director of alumni engagement, following her years working in the Office of Admission from 2007 to 2012. Porter has taught and performed nationally and internationally with her biggest theatre accomplishment being cast in \u201CThe Sound of Music\u201D Asia Tour. She has also performed and taught with numerous Birmingham-based groups, including Alabama Symphony Orchestra, Birmingham Children\u2019s Theatre, and the Virginia Samford Theatre.
