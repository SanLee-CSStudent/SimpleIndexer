Schedule a vaccination appointment View the vaccination allocation guidelines Federal court halts vaccine mandate for federal contractors nationwide When Auburn University announced its compliance with the federal contractor vaccine mandate in October, we noted that the mandate may be challenged in court and that we would monitor and communicate any developments. On December 7, 2021, a federal judge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction halting enforcement of the federal contractor and subcontractor vaccine mandate requirements issued by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force in response to President Biden\u2019s Executive Order 14042, Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors. The mandate requires covered contractor employees to be fully vaccinated by January 18, 2022. On November 30, a federal judge in Kentucky blocked enforcement of the mandate in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. Given this development, Auburn is pausing enforcement of its vaccine policy. We will continue to monitor legal challenges to the most recent court order and communicate any further modifications in response to legal developments. Vaccination Program Phases Auburn is currently in Phase 3 of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan, expanding inoculations to Auburn University retirees as well as the family members and dependents of university employees.

Frequently Asked Questions Auburn's Vaccine Plan What type of leave is available for employees that experience adverse effects after receiving the vaccine? Employees who experience adverse effects after receiving vaccine should use their personal leave (sick or vacation). Emergency Covid-19 Administrative Leave (ECAL) is not available for this situation. Can I use leave to get the vaccine? The Covid-19 Vaccine Policy allows employees who are eligible to have up to one hour of paid leave for each vaccine dose. Employees will need to coordinate times with their supervisors. Employees who are travelling from other parts of the state to Auburn in order to receive the vaccine will be required to use their personal leave (sick or vacation) minus the one hour of paid leave. Employees traveling to Auburn in order to receive the vaccine are not eligible for work related travel expense reimbursement. How can someone who is not an Auburn employee or student get the Covid-19 vaccine? Vaccinations are now available to members of the campus community as well as the local community. Anyone wanting to schedule a vaccine can go to the vaccine scheduling website and click on \u201CAuburn Community Portal. The available clinics will be listed. Is Auburn using its allotment of vaccine only for its campus community, specifically current employees and students? Auburn was approved to receive vaccine allotments by the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) on a mandate of first providing inoculations to its faculty, staff and students before opening any subsequent doses to the community at large. Currently, the university has adequate supplies of vaccine available. The university is currently in Phase 3 of its distribution plan with vaccines available to all. Who is eligible to receive a vaccine?

We will continue to monitor legal challenges to the most recent court order and communicate any further modifications in response to legal developments. Are there other locations where I can get vaccinated? Yes. COVID-19 vaccines are widely available at this time and there are additional options available for receiving the vaccine. Individuals who wish to be vaccinated for COVID-19 are encouraged to take any opportunities to register or receive the vaccine that may be available to them, such as through health care providers or public health programs, in addition to registering through Auburn. To find a COVID-19 vaccine clinic near you, text your zip code to 438829 or visit vaccines.gov or visit the ADPH COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Dashboard. Additional Vaccine Distributors How much will this vaccine cost? Auburn is providing the vaccine at no cost to employees, students and family members. However, vaccination providers in the community may charge an administration fee for giving the shot. About the Vaccine Why should I get the COVID-19 vaccination? A COVID-19 vaccine might: Prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from becoming seriously ill or dying of COVID-19. Prevent you from spreading the COVID-19 virus to others. Add to the number of people in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19. Prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading and replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more resistant to vaccines.

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use the same technology but contain slightly different mRNAs and different ingredients used to protect the mRNA, maintain the pH and stabilize the solution. They are essentially equally effective and have similar side effects. Where can I find out more information about Covid-19 vaccine development? Click here to review information about development of Covid-19 vaccines in the United States, including information about rate of development. Are any Covid-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA? On Aug. 23, 2021, the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and on Jan. 31, 2022, the agency granted full approval to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer is fully approved for the prevention of COVID-19 in people 16 years of age and older, and Moderna is fully approved for people 18 years of age and older. Each vaccine will continue to be available under its EUAs for: Teens who are between 12 to 15 years of age (Pfizer), younger children between 5 to 11 years of age (Pfizer), and certain people as a third dose or booster shot (Pfizer and Moderna). Additionally, the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine will still be offered under its EUAs. What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)? The FDA can issue an EUA during a public health emergency to allow the special use of a medical product not yet approved by the FDA. For the FDA to issue an EUA, safety and efficacy must be demonstrated, and certain criteria must be met, including that there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives. What does the FDA review for the EUA process? Similar to an approval evaluation, the FDA reviews clinical trial data, looking specifically for safety data and efficacy data to make their decision. Career scientists at the FDA are tasked with ensuring that this vaccine is safe and it works, just as they do for all other vaccines we use in the United States. Can I get the vaccine if I\u2019ve had Covid-19 or think I may have had Covid-19 in the past? According to CDC, vaccination should be offered regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data from phase 2\/3 clinical trials suggest vaccination is safe and likely efficacious in these people. Current evidence suggests that people who have had Covid-19 may be protected for up to 90 days after their initial infection, so they may decide to wait until after this period, if desired. How do the vaccines work? Each vaccine uses a slightly different approach with the same goal: to induce an immune response in the body against SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna are both mRNA vaccines. This type of vaccine operates somewhat differently than other types, like the seasonal flu vaccine. mRNA vaccines contain a message from the virus that causes Covid-19 and gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build immune cells that will remember how to fight the virus that causes Covid-19 if we are infected in the future. Most of the vaccines will require two shots, with the second shot received 21 to 28 days after the first, depending on the vaccine. Can I choose which vaccine I want? Yes, by way of the date you select after entering the scheduler website. When scheduling your appointment, the date in the scheduler will indicate which product is being administered that day Which vaccine should I get? All currently authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and reduce your risk of severe illness. The CDC does not recommend one vaccine over another. Pfizer is available for people 5 and older; requires 2 shots; and the second dose is 21 days after the first. Moderna is for people 18 and older; requires 2 shots; and the second dose is 28 days after the first. Johnson & Johnson is for people 18 and older; requires 1 shot. Boosters are recommended for Pfizer and Moderna at least 5 months after the final dose of the primary series and at least 2 months after the first dose of Johnson & Johnson. There is a warning for women aged 18-49. Reports of adverse events following the use of the J&J vaccine suggest a very low but increased risk of a rare adverse event call thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). Nearly all reports of this serious condition, which involves blood clots with low platelets, have been in adult women younger than 50 years old. Women younger than 50 years old should be aware of the rare but increased risk of this adverse event and that there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen. How many doses of the vaccine will I receive? Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses to be effective. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine is administered three weeks after the first dose while the second dose of the Moderna vaccine is administered four weeks after the first. Boosters are recommended for Pfizer and Moderna at least 5 months after the final dose of the primary series and at least 2 months after the first dose of Johnson & Johnson. How did a vaccine get developed and approved so quickly? Was the process rushed? Producing a vaccine against Covid-19 has been the top priority of scientists and governments around the world to help bring an end to the pandemic. With the coordinated and enormous investment of resources, development of these vaccines has been accelerated, all while maintaining standards for safety and efficacy. Rather than eliminating steps from traditional vaccine development timelines, steps are proceeding simultaneously, such as scaling up manufacturing while safety and efficacy data are collected. Are the vaccines safe and what are the side effects? Before receiving approval for emergency use, pharmaceutical companies must provide evidence that their vaccines are safe. A team of experts from the FDA, CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and other agencies reviewed all available data on safety and efficacy before recommending them for use. It is important to note that the Pfizer and Moderna trials did not include individuals younger than 18 years old, pregnant or nursing women, or immunocompromised individuals and therefore, whether these vaccines work or are safe in these groups cannot been determined at this time. No serious side effects have been reported with either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines to date. Any side effects from Covid-19 vaccination are normal and indicate that you are building protection. Most of the side effects go away quickly. Learn more about what side effects to expect and what to do about them if you experience them. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and short-lived. Noted adverse effects were injection site redness, pain and swelling, fatigue, fever, chills, headache, nausea, muscle pain and joint pain. According to the FDA the most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1, or go to the nearest hospital. Call the vaccination provider or your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away. For more information, visit the CDC\u2019s Safety of Covid-19 vaccines and CDC\u2019s Covid-19 Vaccine FAQ\u2019s. Am I protected if I only get one vaccine dose? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccine studies found that two doses were needed to optimize the immune response and provide the best protection from COVID-19. Therefore, the 2-dose regimen is strongly recommended and will be necessary for documentation of full vaccination. Boosters are recommended for Pfizer and Moderna at least 5 months after the final dose of the primary series and at least 2 months after the first dose of Johnson & Johnson. Will vaccines protect against different variants of the coronavirus that have been identified? Yes, health officials believe that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will offer protection against the different variants of the coronavirus. Research is ongoing to further study this issue. Can I get the first dose of one vaccine and the second dose of another? No. This was not evaluated and there is no evidence that the vaccines are interchangeable. If you get a first dose of one vaccine, you should get a second dose of the same vaccine. Individuals administering the vaccine will be tracking this issue. What if I miss the second vaccine dose? According to CDC guidance, second doses administered within a grace period of ¡Â 4 days from the recommended date for the second dose are considered valid; however, doses administered earlier do not need to be repeated. The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second dose for either vaccine. How soon after receiving the vaccine am I protected? It typically takes a few weeks after the final dose of a vaccine for the body to build up immunity to the disease. However, it is not necessary for one to quarantine between each dose. Individuals are recommended to continue with their daily lives while following Covid-19 public health recommendations. How long do the vaccines protect against infection? Health care professionals and researchers are still learning about Covid-19 and new information is discovered nearly every day that is helpful in the fight against this disease. Because Covid-19 is still a relatively new virus, it is difficult to know exactly how the virus affects the body long-term and how long immunity from natural infection lasts. Therefore, it is also difficult to predict how long a vaccine will provide protection against the virus. As the vaccines are administered and new information is gathered, additional data about how long it will protect against the virus will be made available. How effective is the Covid-19 vaccination? Although phase 3 trial results are not available, experimental vaccine interim data indicate 90% efficacy after two doses. Efficacy is the measure of effectiveness obtained from a randomized controlled clinical trial. Further details regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, such as how long the vaccination offers protection, are not yet available. Learn more about how well vaccines work in clinical trials, and how the nation\u2019s vaccine experts will continue to study effectiveness in the real world here. Can an individual receive the influenza vaccine and Covid-19 vaccine at the same time? Getting the influenza vaccine is still very important as one can be infected with both influenza and the coronavirus. Influenza vaccination will also prevent a surge of influenza cases in hospitals that may be overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. Getting both the influenza and Covid-19 vaccine around the same time is considered safe, though experts recommend spacing of the vaccinations by a few days to weeks apart. Can children get the Covid-19 vaccine? Although fewer children have been infected with COVID-19 compared to adults, children can: Be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 Get sick from COVID-19 Spread COVID-19 to others The CDC recommends everyone 5 years and older should get a COVID-19 vaccination to help protect against COVID-19. Widespread vaccination is a critical tool to help stop the pandemic. People who are fully vaccinated can resume activities that they did prior to the pandemic. Children 5 years and older are able to get the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. More information on the COVID-19 Vaccines for Children and Teens Which vaccines will be available at Auburn? The university has all three vaccinations at this time: Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson. How are the Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines different? The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use the same technology but contain slightly different mRNAs and different ingredients used to protect the mRNA, maintain the pH and stabilize the solution. They are essentially equally effective and have similar side effects. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a \u201Cviral vector vaccine\u201D that uses a harmless virus (called a viral vector) to deliver a message to your cells with instructions for making the coronavirus spike protein. After your cells produce the spike protein, your immune system creates antibodies toward the spike protein, protecting you from infection. Visit the CDC website for more information on the Different COVID-19 Vaccines. Where can I find out more information about COVID-19 vaccine development? Click here to review information about development of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, including information about rate of development. Why should I get vaccinated if COVID-19 infection is mild in most people and I am at low risk of complications? Vaccinations will protect you. COVID-19 can cause severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The risk of these bad outcomes increases with some medical conditions and with age, particularly above age 50. It is true that in the majority of younger, healthy people COVID-19 usually causes mild symptoms, though severe infections can occur. Even in those who develop mild illness, the impact can be significant \u2014 missing up to 10 days of work or school due to mandatory isolation, reduced quality of life related to loss of taste or smell, and for approximately one in four people, symptoms may last for two or more months. Receiving the vaccine will protect others. When you protect yourself with the vaccine, you are much less likely to become infected and pass it on to somebody else, such as loved ones or coworkers who might be at higher risk of more severe illness. Also, by vaccinating a large percentage of the population, we slow virus transmission and reduce its ability to mutate into new and potentially more dangerous variants. Why are some people hesitant about getting a COVID vaccine? It\u2019s natural to want to make an informed decision about the COVID-19 vaccine. Fortunately, the safety of the vaccine seen in the clinical trials has been verified by the real-world results. In August 2021, the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccine for use in people ages 16 years and older. The transition from emergency use authorization (EUA) status to full licensure was based on additional data and longer follow-up showing that the vaccine met certain safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality standards. The speed with which the COVID-19 vaccines were developed was incredibly fast. But the science and technology to make it happen came after decades of research. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are new, but scientists have been studying mRNA for many years. They cannot change your DNA. The mRNA sends a message to the body\u2019s cells to make only a specific protein, not a virus, that stimulates the immune system to give you protection. Experts predict that most vaccines in the future will use mRNA technology. Why is their vaccine hesitancy among racial and ethnic minority groups? COVID-19 has decimated communities of color, which are overrepresented in front-line, essential jobs, and vulnerable to risk factors that can make COVID-19 worse. There are many social, geographic, political, economic, and environmental factors that create challenges to vaccination access and acceptance, and that often affect racial and ethnic minority groups. Some communities, particularly communities of color, may have historical reasons to doubt the health care system. But these communities have also been among the hardest hit by this pandemic, and like all of us, have a lot to gain from vaccination. Data consistently show health disparities among racial and ethnic minority groups relative to White populations, including most adult vaccination coverage. These disparities persist even when controlling for other demographic and socioeconomic factors. Both historical and current experiences of racism and discrimination contribute to mistrust of the medical system among racial and ethnic minority groups. This mistrust extends to vaccines, vaccination providers, and the institutions that make recommendations for the use of vaccines. This skepticism, and lack of access, also extends to the COVID-19 vaccines. The university is committed to helping build vaccine confidence across campus, including with racial and ethnic minority groups. This means sharing clear and accurate information to educate about COVID-19, raising awareness about the benefits of vaccinations, and addressing common questions and concerns. For more information, please review the links below from the CDC: Health Equity Considerations and Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups Social Determinants to Health Risk of Exposure to COVID-19 - Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities COVID-19 Vaccine Equity for Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups Race and Ethnicity Data on COVID-19 Vaccination What is in a COVID-19 Vaccine? All COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are safe. Nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are ingredients found in many foods \u2013 fats, sugars, and salts. All COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured with as few ingredients as possible and with very small amounts of each ingredient. Each ingredient in the vaccine serves a specific purpose as seen in the table below. Neither the Pfizer nor Moderna vaccines contain preservatives, antibiotics, medicines\/therapeutics, tissues, food proteins, metals or latex. Click here for a chart from the Alabama Department of Public Health on ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine also both contain a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). The COVID-19 mRNA teaches cells in the body how to create an immune response to the virus that causes COVID-19. This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After, the body produces an immune response, it discards all of the vaccine ingredients, just as it would discard any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine also contains a piece of a modified virus that is not the virus that causes COVID-19. This modified virus is called the vector virus. The vector virus cannot reproduce itself, so it is harmless. This vector virus gives instructions to cells in the body to create an immune response. This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all of the vaccine ingredients just as it would discard any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. Can the COVID-19 vaccine give me COVID-19? No. The COVID-19 vaccines don't use the live virus that causes COVID-19. As a result, the COVID-19 vaccines can't cause you to become sick with COVID-19 or shed any vaccine components. It does take a few weeks for your body to build immunity after getting a COVID-19 vaccination. As a result, it's possible that you could become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or after being vaccinated. How well do the COVID-19 vaccines work? Fully vaccinated people are much less likely to get COVID-19 of any severity. The Pfizer and Moderna reduce the risk of symptomatic infection by more than 90% and appear to reduce the risk of asymptomatic infection by about 80%. Importantly, all three authorized vaccines provide near complete protection against developing severe infection that could lead to hospitalization or death. The rising rates of vaccination across the country are thought to be an important reason why most regions are seeing large reductions in transmission. This has allowed more businesses and schools to fully open up and for the relaxation of masking, distancing and gathering limit requirements. At this time, the large majority of new COVID-19 cases are occurring in unvaccinated individuals. Learn more about vaccine effectiveness from the CDC. What steps are taken to make sure the COVID-19 vaccines are safe? All vaccines go through clinical trials to test safety and effectiveness. For the COVID-19 vaccine, the FDA sets high safety standards for vaccine developers to meet. This infographic from the National Institutes of Health shows the four phases a vaccine goes through before it is released to the public. If a vaccine or medicine is needed to address an emergency situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, once it is shown to be safe and effective, the FDA can grant it an emergency use authorization, or EUA. An EUA allows a vaccine, treatment or medication to be used before the formal FDA approval. Once a vaccine gets an EUA and is being given to people, the FDA and the CDC continue to watch carefully to make sure no problems arise. Data on the vaccine\u2019s safety record accumulates over time when more and more people who receive it report on their experience and any side effects they experience. You can learn more from the CDC about COVID-19 Vaccine safety at the links below: Ensuring COVID-19 Vaccination Safety in the US Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Overview and Safety Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Overview and Safety Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Overview and Safety Are there any side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine? Before receiving approval for emergency use, pharmaceutical companies must provide evidence that their vaccines are safe. A team of experts from the FDA, CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and other agencies reviewed all available data on safety and efficacy before recommending them for use. No serious side effects have been reported with any of the COVID-19 vaccines to date. Some people notice side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, such as pain or swelling where they got the vaccine. Other noted adverse effects were injection site redness, pain and swelling, fatigue, fever, chills, headache, nausea, muscle pain and joint pain. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. COVID-19 vaccine side effects may last about a day or two, and do not signify illness. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and short-lived. These are signs that your immune system is responding and preparing to fight the coronavirus if you catch it. If symptoms persist, you should call your doctor. If you experience a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1, or go to the nearest hospital. Call the vaccination provider or your healthcare provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away. If symptoms persist, you should call your doctor.

Since April 2021, there have been more than a thousand reports of cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) happening after receiving the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines in the US according to the CDC. Considering the hundreds of millions of vaccines doses that have been administered, these reports are very rare. The problem occurs more often in adolescents (teens) and young adults, and in males. The myocarditis or pericarditis in most cases is mild and resolves quickly. Additional information can be found here. You should seek medical attention right away if, within a few days of receiving the second injection of Pfizer or Moderna, you or your child experiences chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heartbeat. Does the COVID-19 vaccine cause blood clots? Use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine might increase the risk of a rare and serious blood clotting disorder. Nearly all of those affected have been women ages 18 to 49, with the disorder happening at a rate of 7 for every 1 million vaccinated women in this age group. For women age 50 and older and men of all ages, the disorder is even more rare. The FDA and the CDC have recommended that use of the vaccine in the U.S. can continue because the benefits outweigh the risks. Evidence of these blood clots haven\u2019t been reported in the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Serious side effects of the Janssen\/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine can occur within three weeks of vaccination and require emergency care. Possible symptoms include: Shortness of breath Persistent stomach pain Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision Chest pain Leg swelling Easy bruising or tiny red spots on the skin beyond the injection site Mild to moderate headaches and muscle aches are common in the first three days after vaccination and don't require emergency care. If I am pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, can I get the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people 12 years and older, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future. You might want to have a conversation with your healthcare provider about COVID-19 vaccination. While such a conversation might be helpful, it is not required before vaccination. Learn more about vaccination considerations for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Should I be worried about vaccine safety? Over the past months, millions of people in the U.S. have been safely vaccinated. The FDA has fully approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and may fully approve other coronavirus vaccines in the future. The FDA and CDC continue to carefully monitor each of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines for safety concerns. Learn more about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Am I protected if I only get one vaccine dose? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccine studies found that two doses were needed to optimize the immune response and provide the best protection from COVID-19. Therefore, the 2-dose regimen is strongly recommended and will be necessary for documentation of full vaccination. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires 1 dose. Booster shots are recommended for Pfizer and Moderna 5 months after getting their second shot and at least 2 months after receiving the first dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Will vaccines protect against different variants of the coronavirus that have been identified? Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified two variants of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as variants of concern: Delta (B.1.617.2). This variant is nearly twice as contagious as earlier variants and might cause more severe illness. The greatest risk of transmission is among unvaccinated people. People who are fully vaccinated can get vaccine breakthrough infections and spread the virus to others. However, it appears that fully vaccinated people spread COVID-19 for a shorter period than do unvaccinated people. While research suggests that COVID-19 vaccines are slightly less effective against the delta variant, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen\/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines still appear to provide protection against severe COVID-19. Omicron (B.1.1.529). This variant spreads more easily than the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the delta variant. However, omicron appears to cause less severe disease. People who are fully vaccinated can get breakthrough infections and spread the virus to others. However, the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness. This variant also reduces the effectiveness of some monoclonal antibody treatments. When can I get a booster shot? If you received the Pfizer vaccine and are 12 years or older you may receive a booster shot at least 5 months after completing your primary COVID-19 vaccination series. Pfizer or Moderna are preferred in most situations; however, teens 12\u201317 years old may only get a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster. If you received the Moderna vaccine and are 18 years or older you may receive a booster shot at least 5 months after completing your primary COVID-19 vaccination series. Pfizer or Moderna are preferred in most situations. If you received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and are 18 years or older you may receive a booster at least 2 months after receiving your initial single COVID-19 vaccination. Pfizer or Moderna are preferred in most situations although the Johnson &J Johnson COVID-19 vaccine may be considered in some situations.

The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are available for patients 18 and older. There are ongoing trials in younger children at this time. Where can I go for more information on the COVID-19 vaccine? There are several resources, including the CDC\u2019s Frequently Asked Questions about COVID -19 Vaccination. Also, please see: CDC - COVID-19 Vaccines FDA - COVID-19 Vaccines HHS \u2013 Fact Sheet: Explaining Operation Warp Speed Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet Moderna EUA Fact Sheet Getting the Vaccine Are any contractors that work on campus allowed to receive the vaccine from Auburn? Certain contractors that work on campus daily to provide critical services to the university and have direct contact with students or employees have been identified. Supervisors for those contractors have been contacted to schedule vaccines. This process is ongoing as additional vaccine becomes available and vaccinations can be scheduled. What should I do during my vaccine visit? Wear your mask into the vaccine clinic and during your vaccination. Bring your AU ID and one other form of identification (must be 18 years of age or older). Bring a pen to sign paperwork. Complete and print vaccine paper work and bring to your appointment. Wear loose-fitting clothing so upper arms can be easily accessed for injection. Review the COVID Moderna EAU Fact Sheet. Review the Covid-19 V-Safe Handout. Review your calendar to ensure you will be able to return for the second vaccine in 28 days (appointment date for the second dose will be scheduled based on vaccine availability). Who should get the vaccine? Everyone who is able to get the vaccine should get it as soon as possible. The more people who get vaccinated, the better we'll be able to stop the spread of the virus. Who should not get the Covid-19 vaccine? Anyone with a severe allergy to a vaccine component (i.e., one that causes anaphylaxis or requires medical intervention); Individuals with a history of severe allergy to any vaccine or injectable medication Those younger than 12 years of age; People currently isolating or experiencing symptoms of Covid-19; these people can get vaccinated once they are finished isolation and their primary symptoms have resolved. Who may need to consult with their healthcare provider regarding the risks and benefits of the vaccine prior to receiving it? Pregnant women People with certain immune-compromising conditions Breastfeeding women People on anticoagulants If I have an autoimmune or immune-compromising condition, can I be vaccinated? People with immune-compromising conditions may get the Covid-19 vaccine as long as they are not in one of the following categories: Severe allergy to a vaccine component (i.e., one that causes anaphylaxis or requires medical intervention) History of severe allergy to any vaccine or injectable medication However, it is recommended that individuals with compromised immune systems discuss their personal risks and benefits with a healthcare provider to determine whether to receive the vaccine. Data about how well the vaccine works and its safety in immune-compromised individuals are not currently available, so it is possible that these individuals could have a lower immune response to vaccination. On the other hand, persons with these conditions may also be at higher risk of severe disease due to Covid-19. Therefore, the CDC recommended that people who are immune-compromised or taking immunosuppressive medications could receive the vaccine if they wanted as long as they do not have other contraindications. With this said, knowing the potential for a lower immune response, if someone with an immune-compromising condition decides to get vaccinated, it will be important to get both doses and practice other public health measures until more is known about their protection against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Post-licensure monitoring systems, like the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), will be used to allow for real-time monitoring of these sub-groups. What other special procedures should be followed? Someone with a history of severe allergy (requiring medical intervention) to anything other than a vaccine or injectable medication can get the vaccine, but they should remain at the vaccination location for medical observation for 30 minutes after receipt of the vaccine. Pregnant women who develop a fever after vaccination should take acetaminophen. People who recently had Covid-19 and were treated with antibody-based therapies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma) should wait until 90 days after treatment to be vaccinated. People with a known Covid-19 exposure should wait until their quarantine is over before getting vaccinated (unless they live in a group setting, such as a nursing home, correctional facility, or homeless shelter, in which case they can be vaccinated during the quarantine period). People who got another vaccine (non-Covid-19 vaccine) should wait at least 14 days before getting Covid-19 vaccine. Likewise, if a person got the Covid-19 vaccine, they should wait at least 14 days before getting any other vaccines (non-Covid-19 vaccines). Should I get the vaccine if I already had confirmed Covid-19 or have a positive antibody test? Yes, as per CDC recommendations, vaccinations should be offered to persons regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic coronavirus infection, including a positive antibody test. People who had COVID-19 are recommended to get the vaccine after they have recovered. The vaccine trials included people who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the vaccine was found to be safe. Because we do not know how long antibodies last after infection and a small number of people have had more severe second bouts of infection, the vaccine can be beneficial in boosting a person\u2019s existing immunity from infection. For persons who experience lingering symptoms for weeks and months after diagnosis (i.e., \u201CCOVID-19 long-haulers\u201D), vaccination is similarly considered safe and likely efficacious. For persons with current Covid-19, vaccination should be deferred until recovery from acute illness and can be deferred up until 90 days after the current episode. Should people with a history or allergic reactions receive the vaccine? Per CDC and FDA recommendations, those who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccines should not be vaccinated. For those who have had a severe allergic reaction to another vaccine or injectable treatment (intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous) the vaccine can still be administered; however, it is recommended that the risks be discussed with a healthcare provider and that the recipient be monitored for 30 minutes post-vaccination. For those with any other allergy (e.g. food, pollen, pets), vaccination should be offered. All individuals who received vaccines should be observed for about 15 minutes after vaccination. Will the vaccine be safe for pregnant women and women trying to conceive? Pregnant women and women trying to conceive were not included in the first round of clinical trials for the Covid-19 vaccines, so no safety data is currently available for these groups. However, CDC recommends that pregnant women consider their personal risk of contracting Covid-19 by occupation or other activities, risk of Covid-19 to her and her pregnancy, efficacy of the vaccine, and known side effects of the vaccine when deciding whether to be vaccinated. Pregnant women and women trying to conceive should have a discussion with their healthcare provider about risks and benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine. Can I get the Covid-19 vaccine if I am breastfeeding? Yes. Although women who are breastfeeding were not included in the clinical trials, current data suggest that Covid-19 is not transmitted through breast milk, so it is not expected that vaccination would cause a concern either. On the other hand, some women who are breastfeeding will be at higher risk for exposure, so they could benefit from receiving the vaccine. In addition, women do not need to delay breastfeeding for any period of time after they have been vaccinated. When will children under the age of 16 people to receive the Covid-19 vaccine? Currently, the Pfizer vaccine is available to individuals age 5 and up, and the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are both available to individuals 18 years of age and older. What if I am scheduled to receive a vaccine and I discover that I had a close contact exposure just prior to their appointment? Cancel your scheduled appointment, self-quarantine for 10 days, get tested at any point if you become symptomatic, consider getting tested 5 to 8 days after the last known date of exposure and if all tests are negative reschedule your vaccination date. If any of their tests are positive, begin your 10-day isolation period, inform your close contacts to quarantine and get tested, and reschedule to receive your first vaccination 90 days after completion of their isolation period. What if I received the 1st dose of the vaccine and then discover that I had a close contact exposure prior to receiving the 2nd dose? If it is within 10 days of their scheduled appointment for their 2nd dose, cancel their appointment. Self-quarantine for 10 days, get tested at any point if they become symptomatic, consider getting tested 5 to 8 days after the last known date of exposure and if all tests are negative reschedule their vaccination date. If any of their tests are positive, begin their 10-day isolation period, inform close contacts to quarantine and get tested and plan to receive their first vaccination shot 90 days after completion of their isolation period. Inform the CDC of their positive test result. What if I have received the 1st dose of the vaccine and then test positive for COVID prior to receiving the 2nd dose? Begin isolation for 10 days, inform close contacts to quarantine and get tested, cancel their scheduled appointment for the 2nd dose and reschedule for a minimum of 90 days after their isolation period is over. Inform the CDC of their positive test. What if I have received BOTH doses of the vaccine and then discover that I had a close contact exposure or test positive? If they were exposed, they should self-quarantine for 10 days, get tested at any point if they become symptomatic, consider getting tested 5 to 8 days after the last known date of exposure. If their tests are negative, they can stop their quarantine. If their tests are positive, begin their 10-day isolation period, inform close contacts to quarantine and get tested and report to the CDC their positive test result. After Receiving the Vaccine Can I use over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc.) in conjunction with my Covid-19 vaccine? As recommended by the CDC, do not premedicate with aspirin, acetaminophen , ibuprofen, etc. unless these are medications you take regularly as part of your usual and customary health practices. However, these pain relievers may be used, as needed, after your vaccine for intolerable symptoms such as fever, arm soreness, headache, etc. You may view information from the CDC regarding this issue. If I have a medical concern after receiving the vaccine, such as an unexpected reaction, what should I do? Contact your health care provider or the AU Medical Clinic. How long before the vaccine takes effect? The mRNA vaccines require two doses. While people will have some immunity after the first dose, protection will be most likely about one week after receipt of the second dose. Will the vaccine be given annually or is it only for this year? This is not known at this time. Scientists are continuing to collect data about long-term immunity to SARS-CoV2. If you get the vaccine and become immune, then are exposed to it, can you pass the virus on to others from your exposure? Based on experience with other vaccines and early data from the Covid-19 vaccines, it is likely that people who are vaccinated will have enough immunity where they will not pass the virus to others if exposed, but this is not 100 percent certain. Once I have been vaccinated am I exempt from all safety precautions or lockdowns? No. While experts learn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least 6 feet away from others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC\u2019s recommendations for how to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. Everyone will still need to practice recommended public health measures for a while because it will take some time to slow or stop the spread of the virus. Two factors are important for understanding why: \u2022 While the vaccines appear to be highly effective at preventing disease, it might not prevent asymptomatic infection, meaning vaccine recipients might still be able to get infected, but not have symptoms and, therefore, unwittingly spread the virus. The companies will be doing additional studies to better understand whether this is the case. \u2022 Scientists estimate that to control COVID-19, about 7 or 8 of every 10 people will need to be immune. Given that the U.S. population is more than 330 million people, this means that almost 250 million of them will need to be immune to reach this goal. Between March and November 2020, almost 12 million people in the U.S. were found to be infected, although estimates from antibody studies suggest that the number might be 3-7 times greater. Despite this the virus rages on, demonstrating just how many more people need to become immune before we can expect to control the spread of COVID-19. This also shows how important vaccines are in controlling the spread because more than 250,000 people died as a result of COVID-19 infections between March and November 2020. If we had to rely on infections alone to stop the spread of COVID-19, between 1 million and 5.4 million people would die on the way to 250 million people becoming immune. For these reasons, there will still be some period of time during which other measures, such as masks, physical distancing, and other public health measures, will be required to slow or stop the spread of the virus. And, because we won\u2019t know who might still be able to be infected after vaccination or previous illness, everyone will be asked to comply. There is still more to learn about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before deciding to change recommendations on steps everyone should take to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision.
