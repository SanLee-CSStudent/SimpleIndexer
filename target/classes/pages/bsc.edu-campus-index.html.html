They also want to educate you on how to stay safe when you are off campus. Below are a few helpful hints for you to remember. Always be aware of your surroundings. Stay away from deserted or poorly lit areas. Travel in groups if possible. Do not accept rides from strangers or people who make you feel uneasy. Always be careful when strangers approach you. This rule is true no matter where you are. Always be prepared with a fully charged cell phone and carry a small amount of emergency change in case you need to use a pay phone. If you need emergency transportation, call your BSC Campus Police at 205\/226-4700. Most importantly, if you are suspicious of a location, leave! Always trust your instincts in matters of personal safety!
