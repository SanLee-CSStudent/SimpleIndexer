The Quality Checkup Visit is an important part of the regular AQIP cycle that occurs prior to reaffirmation of accreditation. Components of the AQIP Quality Checkup Visit are: 1. Systems Portfolio Clarification and Verification 2. Systems Appraisal Follow-Up 3. Accreditation Issues Follow-Up 4. Federal Compliance Review 5. Organizational Quality Commitment CAC\u2019s AQIP Quality Checkup Visit was conducted by two trained and experienced AQIP Reviewers \u2014 Gloria Dohman, Ph.D., Accreditation Liaison Officer, North Dakota State College of Science and Donna Wood, Ph.D., Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs, Tulsa Community College.

Quality Checkup Visit Report Quality Council QUALITY COUNCIL Historically, the purpose of the Central Arizona College Quality Council (formerly the North Central Association Steering Committee) has been driven by accreditation. With the emphasis of district-wide quality, a need existed for an entity to coordinate, monitor, and provide leadership in the development and implementation of quality initiatives. Therefore, the Quality Council is responsible for coordinating college quality initiatives with accreditation requirements.The Quality Council also provides leadership and training in the development and implementation of quality initiatives and serves as a resource to the college for quality improvement. This will include serving on quality initiative teams as a quality liaison and coordinating college initiatives with accreditation activities (Action Projects, Systems Portfolio, Systems Appraisal, Strategy Forum, Check-Up Visit, and Reaffirmation). To facilitate the continuous quality improvement process, the President appoints representatives, deemed experts in their area, from each college constituency group across the district. The council works closely with the college\u2019s academic and support operations to ensure efforts that the best practices for improvement initiatives are employed. Units within the college use appropriate results to identify opportunities for improvement. These results include the CAC Systems Portfolio and Appraisal, Academic Program Review, and other institutional assessments and data. Appropriate units tackle smaller improvement initiatives on their own and are encouraged to complete CAC\u2019s Quality Improvement Record. Broader institutional initiatives typically employ the support of the Office of Institutional Effectiveness and Advancement through the Quality Initiatives Proposal process. The Quality Council owns this process with the intention of quality initiative proposals moving forward to the President and Cabinet for consideration. Quality initiatives can emerge from a variety of sources. Based on results from an evaluative tool (survey, needs assessment or formal program review), a unit or employee may propose a quality initiative. A quality initiative may result from an Academic Quality Improvement Program (AQIP) activity such as the Systems Portfolio, Systems Appraisal or Strategy Forum. The Quality Council, as a representation of each constituent group, moves the proposal forward with the the vice president of the area that is most impacted by the proposal as the process owner. These vice presidents share the Cabinet\u2019s decision and any related recommendations with the Quality Council. Content on this page is provided by Accreditation & Quality Initiatives. System Portfolio SYSTEMS PORTFOLIO PROCESS One of the Academic Quality Improvement Program\u2019s (AQIP) core processes, the systems Portfolio \u201Cdescribes key systems and processes the organization uses to achieve its goals and the performance results it obtains from them. During the first four years of participation, an organization assembles a Systems Portfolio with broad faculty and staff involvement. This document is essential for the systems Appraisal that AQIP conducts three years after the organization is accepted to partcipate in AQIP. The systems Portfolio consists of an Organizational Overview and explicates each of the major systems employed to accomplish an organization\u2019s mission and objectives. The organization answers specific questions for each of the nine AQIP Categories. For each system, the questions deal with, processes, results, and improvement. The Organizational Overview presents a capsule picture that helps readers understand the organization\u2019s key strengths and ambitions, as well as the challenges and conflicts it faces.\u201D The Systems Portfolio is a record of CAC\u2019s activities with regard to the nine key processes of AQIP and acts as a high-quality, actionable feedback on CAC\u2019s strengths & opportunities from a team of quality improvement experts and educators, body of evidence to show the Higher Learning Commission that CAC is meeting its Criteria for Accreditation, common reference point that lets everyone at CAC share an understanding of how we are organized, what are our key processes, what kind of performance those processes produce, and how we improve, planning tool that helps us share the institution\u2019s future agenda and concentrates everyone\u2019s attention on those areas that should be the focus for scrutiny for improvement, body of evidence, over time, that AQIP is working to CAC\u2019s advantage, and that our continued participation in the program makes sense, public information and relations tool that lets all of our stakeholders understand clearly and persuasively what we are accomplishing with our resources Content on this page is provided by Accreditation & Quality Initiatives.

In March 1993, NCA extended full accreditation to the District for ten years (the maximum period allowable). In November 2000, Central Arizona College was accepted as a participant in the Academic Quality Improvement Program (AQIP), by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), a Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. AQIP provides CAC with a structure to increasingly transform into an institution focusing on continuous improvement. Action Projects (institutional quality initiatives), the Systems Portfolio (self-study), and Systems Appraisal (feedback) assist in CAC\u2019s improvement. CAC has an infrastructure in place to support institutional improvements consisting of the CAC Quality Council, the Director of Accreditation and Quality Initiatives, the Office of Institutional Planning and Research, and the Office of Resource Development. 1.
