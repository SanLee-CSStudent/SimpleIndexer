Good people wake up at 4:30, and great people wake up at 4:25. I\u2019m not great just yet, but I\u2019ll try to get somewhere in the middle.\u201D As a producer and radio host at WJOX 94.5 in Birmingham, Mitchell begins the day by lining up commercials and reviewing game-day cuts and press conferences for his 6 a.m. radio shows \u2013 Jox Morning every weekday, and Jox Game Day every Saturday. To Mitchell, the early mornings never feel like work because he\u2019s talking about the sports news on air that he\u2019s always watched, discussed, and argued over with friends. Mitchell joined the station in 2019, focusing on production. He soon gained his first on-air opportunity in 20-second traffic updates for the Birmingham area, which led to bigger roles in front of the microphone. Mitchell is involved in almost every aspect of several WJOX shows \u2013 collecting daily scores and stats, managing sound, and starring as the on-air personality. Every day, he combines his degree in media and film studies with his love for sports and his past as a BSC football player \u2013 and he brings BSC into the Jox Morning conversation whenever possible. \u201CI got the chance to put my personality out there,\u201D he says. \u201CPeople often want my perspective because I\u2019m the youngest person in the building, and I have playing experience.\u201D Just as he did as a football player, he analyzes his performance, listening to each show after it airs to study what he did right and how he can improve. \u201CYou can\u2019t focus on just one thing in radio, and I want to be the most prepared person in the room,\u201D Mitchell says. \u201CI look at every show I do as a game. I want to get better with every show.\u201D He follows advice from Head Football Coach Tony Joe White \u2013 to balance seeking perfection and knowing that you can\u2019t be perfect \u2013 and from Associate Lecturer of English Melinda Rainey Thompson \u2013 to find a clear and genuine voice with his own humor and personality at the core. \u201CI always knew I wanted to stick around the game, and sports radio has given me that chance,\u201D Mitchell says. \u201CIt\u2019s just me speaking my mind because I know what these guys are going through. I\u2019m living my dream \u2013 I\u2019m getting paid to talk about sports.\u201D This story was published in the Fall\/Winter 2021 issue of \u2019Southern, BSC\u2019s alumni magazine.
