The student activities program at Calhoun Community College is the responsibility of the students through the Student Government Association (SGA). Be sure to browse through our gallery to view photos from many of our events. The SGA is intended to provide for active student self-government; to encourage mutual respect among students, faculty, and administrators; to promote the involvement of students in community programs and projects; to provide social and recreational outlets for all students; to function as an organized and realistic laboratory through which students may acquire and \u201Ctry out\u201D those skills necessary for living in and improving their communities. Calhoun Community College encourages student participation in institutional decision-making. The SGA represents student views to the college administration through representation on the College Council, and Discipline Committee, as well as other special appointments. All students should take an active part in the SGA by (1) voting in every election; (2) taking the initiative to run for offices; and (3) conveying ideas and\/or requests to elected student representatives. The office of the SGA is located in MSA 120 on the Decatur Campus, with regular hours maintained by the student government officials. All students are urged to meet with their representatives and to take an active part in the affairs of the student government.
