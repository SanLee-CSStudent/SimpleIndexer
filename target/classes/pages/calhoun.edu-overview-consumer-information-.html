Calhoun Community College supports every effort to affirm the American Democratic process. Each year on September 17th, the college participates in the annual observance of American Constitution and Citizenship Day. On this day, special time is set aside to educate students on the importance of the constitution, the role it still plays in their everyday lives, and being responsible citizens. Some of the activities include classroom viewing of constitution day video, American flags on display, copies of the constitution made available and voter registration forms are distributed.
