Watson Child Development Learning Lab, in coordination with the parents of enrolled children, offers children the opportunity to develop physically, cognitively, socially and emotionally within a prepared conducive to active learning. AWC CDLL has an open door policy. Parents are welcome to observe or participate at any time. The overall program goal is to encourage each child to be a responsible self-directed individual with a positive self-concept. The AWC Child Development Learning Laboratory has several purposes. The laboratory setting is where AWC Early Childhood Education students observe and learn to work with young children as part of their college program. Each AWC student will become a knowledgeable and experienced child care professional with an understanding of child development and observation, appropriate practices, and the planning and preparation necessary to create a quality environment for young children. The lab also provides a safe, healthy environment where young children learn through play with developmentally appropriate activities, alone and with other children their age, and are supervised by qualified educare personnel. Each child will become a responsible self-directed individual with a positive self-concept. Experiences in the CDLL will allow each child to make a successful transition from home to school, develop social skills, interest and joy in learning, feelings of success and security, responsibility and self-control, creativity, self-expression, and critical thinking skills. The lab also benefits the AWC\/NAU faculty, staff, and students. The lab is a high quality place to leave their children while attending classes or working on campus. Enrolling your Child in Our Center In order to enroll your child in the CDLL you must be a Faculty, Staff, or student at AWC, NAU Yuma, U of A Yuma, ASU Yuma or be employed by the Yuma Elementary District 1 or the Yuma Union High School District.
