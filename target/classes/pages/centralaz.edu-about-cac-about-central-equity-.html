The Equity Plan will address areas of concern to bring vivid exposure and focus on diversity, equity and inclusion in student success initiatives, college policies, employee recruitment and retention, hiring protocols and Guided Pathways curricula. Through a reexamination of the Civility Statement and CAC\u2019s college goals, the Equity Plan will \u2018Shine a L.I.G.H.T.\u2019 on diversity and equity for our campus and community. The plan includes 5 Spotlight Areas including Completion, Access, Retention, Equitable Representation and Stewardship and will include a review of student success data, college policies and procedures and curriculum and pedagogy in each academic division.

Civility Statement Civility Statement The Equity Council has revised CAC\u2019s Civility Statement with the goal of being clear and concise, student-centered, action-oriented and inclusive of all CAC community members. The updated statement is aligned with CAC\u2019s vision, mission, and goals. CAC encourages and promotes an environment of civility and mutual respect among its diverse students, employees and community members. As a community we are committed to building positive relationships, promoting well-being and safety. As an institution of higher learning, it is essential that we continuously evaluate our strengths and weaknesses to demonstrate where we can and will do better. We commit to making CAC a place where everyone finds the respect, dignity, and support they deserve not only as human beings, but as a member of our diverse CAC community. Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Central Arizona College is proudly designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) by the U.S. Department of Education. What is an HSI? As designated by the U.S. Department of Education, an HSI is an institution that enrolls a minimum of 25% full-time Hispanic students. As of Fall 2020, CAC has achieved enrollment of 39% full-time Hispanic students making the college eligible for grants to expand educational opportunities for Hispanic students. These grants enable HSI campuses to expand educational opportunities, academic offerings, and strengthen student services that increase retention and graduation. In addition to federal resources, HSI status helps us create a more welcoming and inclusive campus culture for Hispanic students.
