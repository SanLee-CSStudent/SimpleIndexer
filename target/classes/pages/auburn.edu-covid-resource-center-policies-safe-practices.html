Symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, fever, new loss of taste or smell, chills, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea. Face Coverings Effective February 23, 2022, face coverings will be optional for all individuals on Auburn University\u2019s campus. Faculty members may require face coverings in their classroom if the faculty member has a face coverings requirement in the course syllabus. Auburn no longer requires masks to be worn on Tiger Transit buses, campus shuttles or at campus transportation hubs and stops. On Monday, April 18, a federal judge in Florida struck down the federal mask requirement on airplanes, taxis, trains, buses and other public transportation. The decision includes airports, train stations and other transportation hubs. Because of the ruling, the masking order is no longer in effect and the Transportation Security Administration is no longer enforcing it. At this time, it is uncertain whether the decision will be appealed. The CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings. Face coverings must be worn by everyone in the following areas: Healthcare settings, such as the Auburn University Pharmaceutical Care Center, the Auburn University employee and student pharmacies, the College of Veterinary Medicine hospitals and clinic and the Auburn University Medical Clinic. Other areas marked by official university signage or otherwise clearly communicated by the university. The complete policy can be found here. Safe Hygiene To ensure the campus community remains healthy, everyone is encouraged to follow these guidelines: Get vaccinated for Covid-19 through Auburn or elsewhere in the community. Covid-19 vaccines are effective at preventing you from getting sick. Covid-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. Getting vaccinated is the best way to slow the spread of Covid-19. Self-monitor for symptoms of Covid-19. Do not come to campus if you have symptoms or feel ill. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of Covid-19. Take your temperature if symptoms develop. Don\u2019t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen. Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Monitoring symptoms is especially important if you are running errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet Wear a face covering when around others if you have not been fully vaccinated. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, 70% alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used. Hand sanitizer stations can be found throughout all campus facilities. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. Self-Reporting The university requires all current students and employees who test positive for Covid-19, regardless of testing location, to complete a confidential Self-Report Form. Self-reported data includes those reports submitted by students, faculty, staff and third-party contractors working on campus who have tested positive for Covid-19. Students and employees are required to self-report positive Covid-19 test results, regardless of where they choose to be tested. There are no negative consequences for reporting a positive Covid-19 test result. The Self-Report Form is how an individual notifies Auburn University, through the Covid-19 Resource Center, about their test result. Contact Tracing Given the high Covid-19 transmission rates, contact tracing is not pragmatic or effective at this time, and as such, effective May 6, 2022 the university will suspend contact tracing programs. Rapid spread has exceeded capacity to track contacts in a timely manner that would provide any actionable information to help mitigate spread or make decisions. Students, faculty, and staff who test positive for Covid-19 should still self-report their positive test result but will be responsible for notifying close contacts on their own. They should encourage close contacts who have been exposed to monitor symptoms and test 5 days after exposure. Employees who have tested positive for Covid-19 must notify the Human Resources Liaison for their department. Campus Cleaning Measures Based on the most current CDC guidance, Facilities Management has transitioned away from the modified cleaning services that were introduced at the beginning of the pandemic back to traditional cleaning services. At this time, disinfection cleaning chemicals are still being used in lieu of traditional cleaning solvents. Enhanced disinfection services are still available in instances of positive cases of Covid-19 being reported - simply notify Facilities Management of any known contaminations either via work order submission, email at clean@auburn.edu, or by calling 844-HELP (4357). Facilities will also continue to provide disposable sanitizing wipe stations in classrooms, and hand sanitizer stands throughout campus buildings. Additionally, Facilities continues to take multiple actions in campus buildings related to air quality and ventilation including: ensuring ventilation systems are operating properly, upgraded air filters are installed, and outdoor air circulation is increased.

Quarantine and Isolation Housing Effective date May 6, 2022 (end of Spring Semester), quarantine and isolation housing will no longer be offered. Students should use the following guidance for quarantine and isolation: Isolation - The CDC has provided updated isolation recommendations. If a student living in on-campus housing receives a positive Covid-19 test, regardless of vaccination status, they should do the following: Stay at an isolation location for 5 days. We encourage on-campus students return home to complete their isolation period. Students may also choose to isolate in their residence hall or University apartment and should only leave to receive medical care or for meals. The university is not providing separate housing or meal delivery to those who need isolation. If you decide to remain on-campus during your isolation period, you may not eat or drink in the campus dining locations but can use contactless delivery services to obtain meals. If you have no symptoms or your symptoms are resolving after 5 days, you can leave isolation. If you have a fever, continue to stay in isolation until at least 24 hours after your fever resolves. Continue to wear a mask around others for 5 additional days. Quarantine - The CDC has provided updated quarantine recommendations. If you believe you have come in contact with a Covid-19 positive person (including your room\/suitemate), please follow the directions outlined below based on your vaccination status: If you have been boosted OR completed the primary series of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine within the last 5 months OR completed the primary series of J&J vaccine within the last 2 months, you should wear a mask around others for 10 days. If you develop symptoms, seek testing and self-quarantine until you know the result. If you have completed the primary series of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine over 5 months ago and are not boosted; or you completed the primary series of J&J over 2 months ago and are not boosted; or you are unvaccinated, you should do the following: Stay in a self-quarantine location of your choosing for 5 days. After 5 days, continue to wear a mask around others for 5 additional days. If you can\u2019t self-quarantine, you must wear a mask for 10 days. If you develop symptoms, seek testing and self-quarantine until you know the result.
