Successful gap year experiences start with a well-developed plan and include personal goals. We encourage students considering BSC for their undergraduate educations to apply and gain admission before requesting an enrollment deferral to participate in a gap year experience. We will ask students to submit their request in writing and will to discuss gap year plans with you before granting a request. BSC will consider enrollment deferral requests for the following reasons: Military service Religious engagement International students in the process of gaining a Visa (one year only) Research, work, and internship opportunities related to educational or financial goals Health reasons If you are granted your enrollment deferral, you will need to pay your enrollment deposit and alert the Admissions Office no later than June 1st. You cannot enroll in a degree-seeking program at another institution, and cannot apply to other colleges during your deferral. You will need to submit financial aid forms (FAFSA) again for the following year, but unless your family\u2019s financial circumstances change significantly, we strive to keep your financial aid package similar to what was originally offered. In April of your deferment year, we ask you to reactivate your application by calling our office at (205) 226-4696. Non-Degree Seeking Students To all non-degree seeking students who wish to take a class at Birmingham-Southern, please contact Marilyn Gillespie at (205)226-4680 or [email protected] for more information and the appropriate forms.
