The collection and processing of this information is necessary for the administration of our business and the provision of our services, which is necessary for the legitimate interests of our business. This Privacy Policy also explains your rights as well as the choices you can make to limit how your personal information is shared by CBC. Within this Privacy Policy, we describe the following as it relates to your personal information: TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW IT IS COLLECTED HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES USE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS CHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY OUR DATA SECURITY PROCEDURES CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY HOW TO CONTACT US TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW IT IS COLLECTED We may collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you use the CBC website (including cbc.edu), set-up or change your account information on, subscribe to notifications, make requests, or communicate with us while using our website. Our website and mobile application provide convenient ways for you to access the Service and learn about important CBC opportunities and events. We collect information about our online visitors both directly and indirectly from other companies that provide data to us. We use this information to communicate with our supporters and clients and process their transactions. We do not sell it to other organizations. When you use our website or mobile application to make a donation, we may ask you for your name, address, phone number(s), and other information relevant to the transaction. We will ask for standard credit card information when you make a financial donation or purchase. We and our authorized subcontractors may automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use our Service (\u201CUsage Information\u201D). Usage Information may include your IP address, device identifier, Ad ID, browser type, operating system characteristics, data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device), and information about your use of our Service, such as the time and duration of your visit and how you arrived at our Service. Except to the extent required by applicable law, CBC does not consider Usage Information to be Personal Information. However, Usage Information may be combined with your Personal Information. To the extent that we combine Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include: Log Information: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring\/exiting pages, operating system, date\/time stamps, and related data, which may be stored in log files or otherwise. Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Cookies, web beacons (also known as \u201Ctracking pixels\u201D), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (\u201CTracking Technologies\u201D) may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service or emails, including information about your browsing and activity behavior. Cookies: A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user\u2019s device which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain longer and help in understanding how you use the Service and enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period. If you use your browser\u2019s method of blocking or removing cookies, some, but not all types of cookies may be deleted and\/or blocked and as a result, some features and functionalities of the Service may not work. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file that may be placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies and HTML5 cookies are locally stored on your device other than in the browser, and browser settings won\u2019t control them. To identify certain types of locally shared objects on your computer, visit your settings and make adjustments. The Service may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your devices. Web Beacons (\u201CTracking Pixels\u201D): Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as \u201CInternet tags\u201D or \u201Cclear gifs,\u201D embedded in web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to our Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Embedded Scripts: An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server, or from a third party with which we work, and is active only while you are connected to the Service and deleted or deactivated thereafter. Location-identifying Technologies: GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location. If you use our Services from your mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location. Fingerprinting: Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, are for purposes of identification and\/or tracking (note that we do NOT collect any fingerprints or other biometric data from you). Device Recognition Technologies: Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household). In-app Tracking Methods: There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or other identifiers such as \u201CAd IDs\u201D to associate app user activity to a particular app. We are giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them explained in the \u201CAnalytics Services, Advertising, and Online Tracking\u201D and \u201CYour Choices\u201D sections below, so that your consent to encountering them is meaningfully informed and to track user activity across apps. We may also obtain information about you from other sources and combine that with information we collect about you. To the extent we combine such third party-sourced information with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or third-party practices. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION We may use information about you for any purposes not inconsistent with our statements under this Privacy Policy or prohibited by applicable law, including to: Create and service your account; Fulfill, confirm, and communicate with you regarding your transactions; Respond to your comments, questions, and requests, and provide support; Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, information regarding changes to our policies, and support and administrative messages; Prevent and address fraud, breach of policies or terms, and threats or harm; Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities; Improve our Service or other CBC digital properties, mobile applications, marketing efforts, products and services; and Send you recommendations and communicate with you regarding our and third-party offerings, programs, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events we think you may be interested in (for information about how to manage these communications, see \u201CYour Choices\u201D below). YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES Accessing and Changing Information You may access, review, correct, and update certain account information you have submitted to us by contacting us here. We will make a good faith effort to make the changes in CBC then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it may not be possible to completely change your information. We reserve the right to retain data as required by applicable law; and for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained as permitted by applicable law (e.g., business records). Tracking Technologies Generally Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe\u2019s website here. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service, your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a \u201CDo Not Track\u201D signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what \u201CDo Not Track\u201D means in this context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a \u201CDo Not Track\u201D signal from a visitor\u2019s browser. To find out more about \u201CDo Not Track,\u201D you can visit here, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser, which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the websites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies. CBC is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third-party choice notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section. Analytics Services and Advertising Tracking Technologies You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going here or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may choose whether to receive Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and subcontractors that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s (\u201CDAA\u201D) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit here, and here for information on the DAA\u2019s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\u201CNAI\u201D). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see here. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and\/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). CBC is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties\u2019 opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. However, we support the ad industry\u2019s Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and expect that ad networks we directly engage to serve you Interest-based Ads will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. Additional Limits on Use of Your Google User Data Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, if you provide the Service access to the following types of your Google data, the Service's use of that data will be subject to these additional restrictions: We will only use access to read, write, modify, or control Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide a web email client that allows users to compose, send, read, and process emails and will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. We will not use this Gmail data for serving advertisements. We will not allow humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with applicable law, or for the Service\u2019s internal operations and even then only when the data have been aggregated and anonymized. Retention of Data We will keep hold of your data for no longer than necessary. The length of time we retain it will depend on any legal obligations we have (such as tax recording purposes), the nature of any contracts we have in place with you, the existence of your consent or our legitimate interests as a business. Communications You can opt out of receiving certain promotional email communications from us at any time by following the instructions provided in emails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging into your account. Please note that your opt-out is limited to the email address and will not affect subsequent requests or accounts you set-up. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other communications may continue. Even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or our ongoing business relations. Our Mobile Applications With respect to our mobile apps (\u201CApp(s)\u201D), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of the App by uninstalling the App. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based or other services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device or in App settings. However, other means of establishing or estimating location in connection with Service use (e.g., IP address, connecting to or proximity to wi-fi, Bluetooth, beacons, or networks, etc.) may persist.
