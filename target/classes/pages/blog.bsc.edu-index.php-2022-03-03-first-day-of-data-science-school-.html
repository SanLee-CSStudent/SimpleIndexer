Returning to the other side of the classroom \u2013 and making time to formally study outside of his research expertise \u2013 is something VanZandt has been wanting to do for a long time, and BSC\u2019s Accelerated Data Science Program presented the perfect opportunity to do so. \u201CAs faculty, we all love the process of learning more,\u201D VanZandt says. \u201CIf we have the time, I know that lots of us would like to take more classes. This was one of the most humbling, difficult experiences I\u2019ve ever had, but, if it wasn\u2019t that difficult, I would not have valued it as I do.\u201D Last summer, VanZandt was part of the very first data science cohort through the College\u2019s collaborative program with Flatiron School. He adds his time in the program to the list of strenuous, and at times grueling, challenges that have become some of his proudest achievements, like earning his doctorate degree, finishing several ultramarathons, and biking for 24 hours straight. \u201CI\u2019ve always believed that computing should be a part of every major,\u201D he says. \u201CThere\u2019s not a discipline, department, or aspect of our lives that\u2019s not touched by data. I saw this program as an opportunity to increase my skills and better understand the possible connections between computing and what our students can do and what I can teach.\u201D After completing pre-work assignments, and bringing his 25 years in statistics and some experience in programming languages, VanZandt joined undergraduate students, recent graduates, and professionals to learn a completely new skillset at a rapid pace. He consistently found ways to apply the knowledge to his work as a faculty member and administrator. VanZandt\u2019s two final projects focused on moths, his research expertise, and on BSC graduation predictors. \u201CI never would have known how to apply these different and novel data science approaches if I hadn\u2019t taken this class,\u201D Van Zandt says. \u201CAs chair of the biology department, I\u2019m interested in how students progress through their first-year sequence. I have the tools now to do an analysis on what factors are leading students to be successful through those first four courses.\u201D Though many students in the data science program are looking to change their career or break into Birmingham\u2019s growing data science companies, VanZandt brought a different but nonetheless important goal \u2013 to gain a new expertise on data science that he will find numerous ways to bring into his current position. \u201CAnd having a student\u2019s perspective again is something that\u2019s going to make my teaching better.\u201D This story was published in the Fall\/Winter 2021 issue of \u2019Southern, BSC\u2019s alumni magazine. If you have ideas for our next issue of \u2019Southern, please email [email protected] We always welcome stories about outstanding people from the BSC community. VanZandt is currently listening to Lord Huron. \u201CWhen the classrooms were loud and I needed to focus, I would listen to a lot of Lord Huron. They\u2019re kind of mellow and folksy, but also have a Texas swing sound.\u201D Categories \u2019Southern Admission Alumni Engagement Athletics Business and Economics Campus Culture Class Notes Education Event Spotlight Faculty Excellence Fine and Performing Arts Giving to BSC Health Professions Humanities Law Math and Applied Computer Science Modern Foreign Languages Natural Sciences Notes From Munger Religious Studies and Ministry Service Learning Social Sciences Student Life Study Abroad Welcome Blog Meta Log in Entries feed Comments feed WordPress.org ? 2022 THE BSC BLOG.
