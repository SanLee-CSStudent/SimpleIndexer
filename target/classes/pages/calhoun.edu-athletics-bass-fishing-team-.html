Last year, the team participated in several national tournament series and gave Calhoun Community College some great publicity. Comprised of 25 active members, they participated in the FLW, BASS and BOAT US college fishing series. Even had one new member transfer here from Arizona to participate on the team. Calhoun had top ten finishes in the following tournaments: Boat US Fall Trail at Logan Martin \u2013 Blake Burtram and Dakota Guzman finished 9th place B.A.S.S. Alabama State Tournament at Lake Eufaula \u2013 Jacob Schrimsher and Austen Willard 5th FLW College Series at Lake Guntersville \u2013 Chris Lupo and Austen Willard 8th place (we also had boats finish in 18th and 24th place out of a total of 277 boats). Three boats qualified for the 2019 FLW National Championship at that tournament. FLW College Series at Lake Chickamauga \u2013 Zane Loveday and Dakota Guzman finished 5th place. Boat US National Championship at Pickwick \u2013 Landon Smith and Jordan Thompson 5th place. Support The team You can be a part of supporting the award-winning Calhoun Bass Fishing Team!
