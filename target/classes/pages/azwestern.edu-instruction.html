A Student Experience One professor who made a difference for me was Professor Angel Luna. I am blessed to have had him as my Studio Art and Sculpture professor. He encouraged me to follow my passion, and although I didn't formally pursue art beyond AWC, that first degree was the foundation for my higher education. Learning ceramic art under his instruction taught me skills that went far beyond sculpture. I learned discipline, timing, dedication, persistence, how to be supportive of peers, humility, and, of course, how to translate abstract creative concepts into something tangible. I apply those skills in everything I do. He pushes his students forward as much as he builds them up. As students, we start as clay. But I was solid when I left AWC, in no small part thanks to Mr. Luna.
