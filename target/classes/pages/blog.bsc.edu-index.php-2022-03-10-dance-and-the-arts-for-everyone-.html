The organization has provided the perfect fit to a career she has prepared for since high school. \u201CI love all the arts, but my calling is to help further them in a management and leadership position,\u201D Litsey says. \u201CI was looking for a position that would help me better understand and be a better advocate for arts education.\u201D Litsey and her husband, Professor of Theatre Dr. Alan Litsey, moved to Birmingham in 1991, the same year The Dance Foundation, based in Homewood, was looking for its first executive director. Prior to the move, Litsey worked for art councils and art museums and produced music and arts festivals in both Michigan and California. While she dabbles in various art forms and does love to sing, she does not call herself an artist \u2013 she does, however, seek to grow arts education and make the arts accessible to everyone. Since 1975, The Dance Foundation (first called The Children\u2019s Dance Foundation) has been a trailblazer in \u201Cthe mission and vision that dance and all the arts are for everyone.\u201D The organization equips teachers and musicians to go into schools around the community, offer classes on site, and partner with other Birmingham-area programs. \u201CThe organization has grown a good bit and expanded its programs, but we\u2019ve stayed true to the mission,\u201D Litsey says. \u201CThe arts are an essential part of everyone\u2019s education, particularly starting with young children. I\u2019m really proud that we\u2019ve fostered that idea \u2013 that anyone can be a dancer, and that growth in a creative capacity is to be celebrated.\u201D The Dance Foundation focuses on three main areas of programming: studio classes, community partnerships, and facility rentals. Under these three umbrellas, the foundation encourages every child to be a dancer and facilitates growth through the arts. The organization\u2019s facility rentals also allow local artists and performers to use the space for practices and performances for short-term or long-term periods. Several BSC alumni have connections to the space, including Whitney Mayfield Renfroe \u201909 and Nell Heflin Goza \u201909, the directors of Formations Dance Company, as well as Cynthia Duggan Mwenja \u201988, Carolyn Patton Rabbani \u201989, Meryem Tunagur \u201917, Liz Leiby \u201911, Megan Pecot \u201918, Rebecca Kornegay Yeager \u201906, Jill Balch Coon \u201992, and Katie Holmes \u201905, to name a few across arts organizations, nonprofits, and other connections in the area. \u201CIt\u2019s exciting to have individuals and organizations call The Dance Foundation Home,\u201D Litsey says. \u201CIt\u2019s important to us that they feel it\u2019s a welcoming, affordable, and convenient place where they can do their creative work and feel supported.\u201D In 2008, Litsey decided to continue her education and earn her master\u2019s degree at Birmingham-Southern. The Master of Public and Private Management Program, which had its last class in 2011, offered more than what she saw in other degree programs. \u201CI felt that having new conversations with folks from different types of businesses and organizations would be really helpful for me, that hearing their stories, learning with them, and learning from faculty would be inspiring at that point in time,\u201D she says. The program added to her experience and previous education \u2013 Litsey earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in arts management \u2013 through a combination of marketing, finance, and organizational development courses, plus enriching conversations in and out of the classroom. It helped her confirm patterns and truths she saw throughout her career and answered the questions she had throughout her work. \u201CThere\u2019s a lot of intuitive decisions we all make, and the MPPM program helped me consider different approaches,\u201D she says. In Litsey\u2019s years at The Dance Foundation, one of the largest areas of growth she has seen is in its space. The foundation moved into a larger space in Homewood in 2003 that has allowed it to increase its reach and collaborations and offer a space for groups of all kinds. The foundation continues to increase partnerships with local dancers, child development centers, schools, and other organizations, striving for equity and inclusion through the arts. \u201CWe want to be a place \u2013 whether in that building or out in the community \u2013 that is open and welcoming and exploring partnership,\u201D Litsey says. \u201CThat\u2019s how I started my career, with genuine and passionate mentors who helped me see that thinking broadly and generously was the path to good things happening.\u201D This story was included in a special fine and performing edition of From the Hilltop, Birmingham-Southern\u2019s alumni email newsletter.
