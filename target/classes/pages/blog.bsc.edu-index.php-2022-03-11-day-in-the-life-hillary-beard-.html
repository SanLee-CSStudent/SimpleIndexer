Hillary Beard \u201912 is approaching year 10 in U.S. Rep. Terri A. Sewell\u2019s (D-AL) office. Before becoming Sewell\u2019s chief of staff in December 2020, Beard joined the team as an intern right after graduating from BSC and rose through the ranks in different press and legislative roles over the years. At this point in her career, she sees the District 7 Congresswoman as one of her most valued guides. \u201CEvery day, I learn new things about her, our district, and our government,\u201D Beard says. \u201CI\u2019ve learned a lot about her way of thinking, her voice, and how she will respond to various issues and scenarios.\u201D As chief of staff, Beard manages a team of about 25 individuals \u2013 including fellow BSC alumni Robyn Gulley \u201920, legislative correspondent, and Trammell McCullough \u201921, congressional intern \u2013 with a diverse range of skills and backgrounds. She also keeps up with the Congresswoman\u2019s relationships with the White House and Cabinet, other members of Congress, and outside stakeholders. We asked her to break down a day in her life on Capitol Hill. 8 a.m.: Beard gets into her office in the Rayburn House Office Building, one of the Congressional buildings on the southern side of the Capitol. First, she has a call with Sewell\u2019s team, and then she prepares for committee and stakeholder meetings. The Congresswoman is assigned to the House Committee on Ways and Means, which will influence many of Beard\u2019s activities and discussions throughout the day. 9 a.m.: Mornings call for meetings, all of which build and maintain the relationships that are crucial to Sewell\u2019s goals and how the team serves her constituents. \u201COn the policy front, we\u2019re always looking at and drafting legislation and working with other congressional offices, committees, federal agencies, and stakeholders,\u201D Beard says. \u201CYou need input from all of those entities, and your relationships can make or break your ability to get a bill or policy change across the finish line.\u201D Beard meets with the other chiefs of staff from the Ways and Means Committee, then with the chiefs of staff from the Democratic Caucus and New Democratic Coalition, a faction of moderate democrats. 11 a.m.: Beard joins Sewell for other meetings with committee and caucus members. They both go to a meeting on voting rights legislation with House leadership, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the House Judiciary Committee, and voting rights stakeholders, like representatives from the Brennan Center for Justice. In the room, Beard sits on the periphery and takes notes as she listens to the conversation. 12 p.m.: They walk to their next meeting \u2013 they take the Capitol\u2019s underground tunnels, excluding when meetings took place on Zoom during the pandemic \u2013 with the Ways and Means Committee Chair U.S. Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) and other members to discuss health care and tax policies. 1:30 p.m.: Once she returns to her office, Beard gets a chance to sit down and answer emails \u2013 emails are always filling up her inbox. She reconnects with other members of Sewell\u2019s staff and answers their questions. Then, she touches base with District Director Melinda Williams or Deputy District Director Ollie Davison, who are both based in Alabama, to hear about what\u2019s going on in the district. 3 p.m.: Beard and the rest of the team spend the afternoon meeting with stakeholders to talk about their concerns and the Congresswoman\u2019s insight on legislation. She hears from various companies and organizations, ranging from Alabama Power to UAB to Alabama Arise, about how upcoming legislation will impact them and the district. 5 p.m.: Sometimes, Beard will head to an evening event, like a dinner, fundraiser, or reception, often with organizations who are visiting from Alabama. If she doesn\u2019t have an event, she stays in the office and works until she feels like her day\u2019s work is complete. Prior to the last two years, she would often work late into the evening, but the pandemic has taught her that there is only so much we can accomplish in one day and that personal time is precious. She\u2019ll take a bus, catch a ride with a friend, or walk since she lives close, and she wraps up another day on the Hill.
