AWS Established Maintenance Window (Friday, June 7, 2019) Blackboard utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host their Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) clients on the cloud. As one of these Blackboard SaaS clients, we are subject to AWS's maintenance schedules and they have recently announced an established maintenance window that occurs weekly on Tuesday mornings at 3:00 - 3:30 AM CST. They say this about the maintenance window... \"The standard maintenance window is a maximum of 30 minutes. Work may or may not happen during this window. Typically work performed during this window takes less than 30 minutes (while our highly available components failover across avail zones). During the maintenance window, AWS performs work on clusters and instances in batches and our processes failover active clusters and instance to a different availability zone.\u202FFor example, RDS and or Infrastructure changes may occur and take 30 seconds to complete, and batch one starts at minute one and batch two starts at minute two. For the security and stability of your environment, maintenance can cause instances to be briefly unavailable.\" Please be aware of this maintenance window and schedule your activities on BbLearn accordingly. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact the Campus Support Center at 479-968-0646 or email them at campussupport@atu.edu.
