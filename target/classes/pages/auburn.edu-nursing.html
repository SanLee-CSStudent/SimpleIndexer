Private contributions provide the Dean with the ability to strategically plan for efforts and activities that will underpin and enrich the education of each nursing student. Gifts from alumni, friends, parents, grandparents, businesses, corporations, foundations, and clinical partners are critically important to support the school\u2019s strategic initiatives, and to help sustain the school\u2019s distinction for preparing excellent nurses, nurse educators, and nurse practitioners. In the past decade, student enrollment has increased from 75 new students accepted each year to more than 215 in the BSN program. With increased students and with increased academic offerings, the faculty and staff have also grown to keep pace to continue to provide a heightened level of responsiveness to students, as they learn and progress through the nursing curriculum. The College of Nursing recognizes and is thankful for each and every gift invested in future Auburn Nurses. To explore how you may contribute to nursing education, please call (334) 844-6753.
