BSC Alumni, auxiliary staff members (United Methodist headquarters, food services, etc.), and Consolidated Pipe employees may use the facility, but do not have family or guest privileges. Also, members of the College Hills Neighborhood Association and their immediate family may use the facility, provided the CHNA membership card is current for that year and has the correct color stripe at the bottom. Each current student, faculty member, and staff member may utilize the facility during the posted hours of operation. Due to safety and liability concerns, no one will be allowed to utilize any aspect of the facility during non-scheduled hours, unless details are presented and prior permission is obtained from the Director. A current BSC ID will be required of everyone who enters the Striplin Center. If any equipment is checked out, the ID card will remain with the Facility Supervisor until the equipment is returned in good condition. The pro-rated replacement cost of any checked-out item that is returned damaged or broken will be charged to the account of the person who checked the equipment out. Scheduled activities (fitness\/wellness programs, intramural sports, varsity sport practices, academic classes, etc.) shall have priority over free-time use of the Striplin Center. Reservations for all areas of the facility can be made, but the availability of the area requested may be limited. Reservations may be requested by calling the Facility Supervisor at 226-4937. Due to safety and liability concerns, no one under the age of 18 years old will be allowed in the Striplin Center unless accompanied by a current BSC student, faculty member, or staff member. No one will be allowed in the swimming pool area unless a certified, department-approved lifeguard is on duty. The pool hours of operation will be posted at the start of each term.

Intramural Sports Safety Eligibility Rosters Captain's Responsibilities Sportsmanship Protests Forfeits Rescheduled Games\/Matches Overtime Play & Mercy Rules Divisions Championship Determination All-Sports Trophy Sportsman And Sportswoman Of The Year Sport Rules Safety There are inherent risks involved in all recreational sports activities. Participation in the BSC Intramural Sports program is purely voluntary and with the understanding that some injuries may occur regardless of the precautions taken. Every effort will be made to make sure that the playing areas and equipment used are safe for the sport\/activity to take place. It is with this in mind that participation in the program requires everyone to sign his or her name to the Intramural Sports Roster\/Waiver form at the start of each sport season. By signing this form, the individual is acknowledging the possibility of injury and will take all needed precautions. Back to Top Eligibility Birmingham-Southern College students who are currently enrolled in at least one class are eligible to participate in the Intramural Sports program, unless otherwise specified. All BSC faculty members (full-time and adjunct) and staff members (full-time and part-time) are also eligible to participate and encouraged to do so whenever schedules permit. Operations, Grounds and Food Service staff members are also eligible to participate in the IM Sports program as are any interested spouses. Alumni, friends, and dependents are not eligible to participate. All faculty and staff members must play on the faculty\/staff team. If there is not a faculty\/staff team entered in a sport, then faculty and staff members may play on a non-Greek student team. Students may play on the faculty\/staff team only if there is no other option available to them (e.g. no non-Greek student team entered in a sport.). A student who participates in an intercollegiate sport (at BSC or any prior institution) or is carried on the roster during the season, is not eligible to participate in that intramural sport (or it\u2019s like) until one academic year has passed from the start of that season. This includes anyone on a varsity athletic roster at the time of the first regular-season intercollegiate contest. Students who hold professional status (at any level) in a sport are ineligible to participate in the same sport (or it\u2019s like). All Greek organizations must field teams made up of their membership and any social affiliates that they may have. Independent students may not play for any Greek organization. Individuals are limited to playing on one team in each IM sport. The only exception to this rule is if there is a co-ed league offered in the sport, then a student may play in both the co-ed league and one of the other leagues formed. Once the season has started, an individual may not change rosters. Additions may be made to rosters up until the time the playoffs start. Individuals who are ineligible for participation in the intramural sports program, and still participate, are subject to suspension, and their team will forfeit all games that the ineligible person played in. Individuals and teams are subject to any and\/or all of the following for violation of eligibility rules: Forfeiture of games Team being dropped from the league Suspension or probation The Director of the Physical Fitness and Recreation Department will have the final decision on all eligibility rulings. Current BSC varsity athletes are not allowed to participate in intramural sports without the expressed consent of the head coach in which he\/she is a participant. Teams that allow a varsity athlete to participate without the consent of the head coach will forfeit all games that the varsity athlete has played. The Physical Fitness and Recreation Department does not assume responsibility for the eligibility of any participant, but will investigate any protested case. Back to Top Rosters All rosters must be filled out completely and submitted no later than 12:00 p.m. on the date the entries close. Late rosters will not be accepted unless prior arrangements are made. All participants must be on the roster before participation in a game\/match. Rosters that are not filled out completely or correctly will not be accepted. Back to Top Captain's Responsibilities The Captain must submit the team entry and roster\/waiver in the desired sport on or before the announced deadline. The roster\/waiver must contain the signature of each participant. The Captain must know, and indicate, all regular and special dates that the team is unavailable to play on the roster\/waiver. The Captain is responsible for notifying all teammates regarding place, date, and time of all contests, as well as furnish score keepers and\/or officials when required. The Captain must be familiar with eligibility, game rules, and make sure his\/her team is aware of the same. The Captain must lead by example. Because of the Captain's interest in sports and leadership, he or she should participate in a sportsmanlike manner and encourage teammates to do likewise. The Captain must complete all arrangements for rescheduled games. Team Captains are responsible for the actions of their teams, bench area, and conduct of their spectators. Back to Top Sportsmanship The development of a sportsman-like attitude is a primary goal of the Intramural Sports program. All individuals and organizations participating in the Intramural Sports program shall be expected to comply with the spirit, as well as the letter, of the rules. Therefore, unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated in any form. Any individual or team that is ejected from a game\/match will not be allowed to return to further competition until they have met with the Director of Physical Fitness & Recreation. Grounds for ejection include, but are not limited to: Disrespect toward officials or staff members Taunting, shoving, or striking an opponent, official, or staff member Fighting Profanity and\/or obscene gestures If a game\/match must be stopped due to the unsportsmanlike conduct of one team, the contest will be recorded as a forfeit for that team and a win for the opposing team. If a game must be stopped due to the unsportsmanlike conduct of both teams, the contest will be recorded as a forfeit for both teams. The Director of the Physical Fitness and Recreation Department will have the final ruling on all suspensions and probations. Back to Top Protests Judgement calls cannot be protested. Protest involving the interpretation of rules must be made prior to the next pitch, scrimmage play, or inbounds play and will be settled by the officials and team captains. A time-out may be given back to a team if it is determined that their interpretation was correct. Protests on eligibility must be made to the referee\/umpire during the game. At this time, the player in question will have the option of continuing play or removing him\/herself from the game without penalty to the team. If the player continues to participate and then is found to be ineligible, then that player and the team must accept the consequences as outlined in the Eligibility section. Back to Top Forfeits Game time is forfeit time. All games will begin at the officially scheduled starting time. A forfeit will be declared if a team or individual is not ready to play at the scheduled time. \u201CReady to play\u201D means a team must be in the playing area with at least the minimum number of required players. The minimum number of players for each sport are as follows: Flag Football 5 players Soccer 5 players Volleyball 4 players Innertube Water Polo 4 players Basketball 4 players Dodgeball 4 players Kickball 8 players Softball 8 players Ultimate 5 players Forfeits are disruptive to the Intramural Sports program and are an irritation to everyone involved. Prior planning and notification will alleviate forfeits and will help increase the quality of the Intramural Sports program. If an individual\/team forfeits two games\/matches during a sport season, then that individual\/team will be banned from further participation in that sport from the time of the second forfeit during that season. The members of that team may not be picked up by other teams to be added to their rosters. All forfeits count as a loss and a half in league standings. Example: Team A wins 3 games, loses a game and forfeits a game. Team A\u2019s record is 3-2.5 Back to Top Rescheduled Games\/Matches Game\/match reschedule requests will be granted if possible. Everything will be done to accomplish the request, but with the many variables that are involved, some game\/match reschedule requests may not be feasible. Rescheduling games\/matches is an option, but one that should be used only when absolutely necessary. Inclement weather and academic functions are considered causes for rescheduling. No games\/matches will be rescheduled due to the absence of team members or coaches. Social functions are not grounds for rescheduling. Back to Top Overtime Play & Mercy Rules Overtime Play is necessary when teams are tied at the end of regulation play. While it is important to give both teams equal opportunities to win in overtime, consideration for time and other factors must be taken into consideration. Mercy rules are incorporated into the various games\/matches for sportsmanship and temperament reasons. The following overtime play and mercy rules will be in effect for the BSC Intramural Sports program: Flag Football Overtime \u2013 Ball will be placed on the 20-yard line and each team will have 4 downs to score a touchdown. PAT's will be: First two OT scores \u2013 3-yard line (one point) Third and subsequent OT scores \u2013 10-yard line (two-points) Mercy Rule \u2013 Thirty (30) point advantage at any time. Soccer Overtime \u2013 No timed overtime. Best of five goal kicks will determine the winner. Mercy Rule \u2013 Seven (7) points at any time during the match. Inner Tube Water Polo Overtime \u2013 Three-minute OT period will be played. Mercy Rule \u2013 Seven (7) points at any time during the match. Basketball Overtime \u2013 Three-minute OT period will be played. Each team will acquire an additional 30-second time-out per OT played. Mercy Rule \u2013 Thirty (30) point advantage at any time. Softball & Kickball Overtime \u2013 One inning at a time will be played until a winner is determined. Mercy Rule \u2013 Fifteen (15) runs after the fourth inning of play and ten (10) runs after the fifth inning. Ultimate Overtime \u2013 Three-minute OT period will be played. Mercy Rule \u2013 Seven (7) points at any time during the match. Back to Top Divisions In some team sports, the number of teams will require that play be separated into two leagues - the \u201CPanther\u201D and \u201CSouthern\u201D leagues. If further divisions are needed, \u201CBlack\u201D and \u201CGold\u201D divisions will be used. If interest in a Co-ed league in a sport exists, then participants will be allowed to compete in both the Co-ed division and either the Women's\/Men's leagues. Back to Top Championship Determination A single elimination tournament will be held to decide the champion in each league. The team with the best \u201Cregular season\u201D record will claim the #1 seed and will play the #4 seed (4th-best regular season record). The #2 seed will compete against the #3 seed. The winners of each game will compete against each other for the championship. The two losing teams will be awarded the points for third and fourth places. Back to Top All-Sports Trophy The Intramural Sports point system has been devised to determine the winner of the BSC All-Sports Championship Trophy in men's and women's competitions. Points are awarded for participation and order of finish in the post-season tournaments. The men's and women's teams accumulating the highest point total for the fall and spring semesters will be awarded the All-Sports Trophy. The All-Sports Trophy points are awarded as follows per sport: First place 100 points Second place 75 points Third\/Fourth places 40 points Participation 10 points In case of a tie for All-Sports the following tie-breaker will be used: Most First Place finishes Most Second Place finishes Most Third Place finishes Most Fourth Place finishes Highest finish in Softball\/Kickball Back to Top Sportsman And Sportswoman Of The Year At the conclusion of the intramural sports year, each organization will have the opportunity to vote on the Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year. Each organization will vote for one person from their organization and one person from another organization. The votes will be tabulated and the persons receiving the most votes will be named Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year. Back to Top Sport Rules Rules for the various intramural sports are available below. Fall: Flag football 7v7 Soccer Volleyball Inner-tube water polo Interim: 3 on 3 Basketball Spring: Basketball Dodgeball Kickball Softball Ultimate Frisbee Back to Top Fitness Activities Through the generosity of the BSC Student Government Association, the department schedules and promotes several fitness and wellness activities during the academic year. Classes in aerobics, martial arts, and yoga all meet several days a week in the Aerobics\/Martial Arts room in the Striplin Center. There is no cost for participating in any of the programs and everyone is invited to take part. Southern Outdoor Recreation Southern Outdoor Recreation (SOR) is an organization created to give students an avenue in which to pursue various outdoor activities while at the College. Several activities are planned during each term of the school year. Occasionally, trips are combined with other institutions in order to make the most of resources and participation. Activities include, but are not limited to, white water rafting, rock climbing, kayak lessons, SCUBA lessons, hiking and camping, caving, snow skiing, and mountain biking. Suggestions for new activities are always welcome and should be submitted to the Director for consideration. Please see the on-line Striplin Center Calendar or call 205-226-4936 for the latest SOR trip offerings.
