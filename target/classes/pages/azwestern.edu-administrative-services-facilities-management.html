All efforts of the department are service based and satisfactory customer service is an essential component and goal of all departmental undertakings. Work Order Procedures Custodial Setup Procedures Work Order Request Form Custodial Setup Request Form Occupant Comfort Zone Because of high energy costs, AWC has established temperature comfort zones for heating and cooling. In the winter, the set point for heating is 70 degrees. In the summer, the set point for cooling is 75 degrees. For those buildings on the Central Plant system, the occupants have the latitude to adjust the temperature + or - two degrees by moving the lever on the bottom of the thermostat between cool and heat. Special requests for exceptions to these standards should be forwarded with justification to this department after approval by the Vice President. Power Outage AWC has emergency backup power only for the NAU phone system and the computer maintenance room. In case of a complete campus power outage, APS must be contacted to re-energize the incoming power off campus to restore power for the campus. That call will be made either by Campus Police or Facilities personnel.
