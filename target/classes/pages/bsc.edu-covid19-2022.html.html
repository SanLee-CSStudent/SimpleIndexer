Campus Protocols MASKING (This policy was updated Monday, March 14, 2022) Beginning Tuesday, March 15, Birmingham-Southern will move to \u201Cmask optional\u201D for all classrooms unless required by the faculty member teaching the class. While masks will be optional, please practice \u201Cmask etiquette.\u201D Offer to wear masks when you are around people who are clearly uncomfortable in confined environments. If you have a cold or congestion, consider wearing a mask to protect those around you. This is a common practice in Japan. (If you have a fever or other serious symptoms, please stay in.) TESTING & ISOLATION\/QUARANTINE Anyone who is symptomatic should continue to report symptoms to HealthCheck or visit Health Services. Health Services will administer rapid and PCR tests as appropriate for individuals\u2019 circumstances. Students will continue to quarantine until the results are received. The protocols for isolation will remain the same with one exception: Starting tomorrow, we will allow students to quarantine\/isolate in their dorm rooms. Hanson Hall will no longer serve as our COVID infirmary. ATHLETICS In-season athletes will still follow the protocols set by the NCAA and agreed to by the presidents of the Southern Athletic Conference. In-season athletes will continue to test according to the guidelines agreed to by the SAA. CONTACT TRACING We will no longer administer contact tracing. Students who test positive are asked to inform peers when appropriate. GUESTS We will allow overnight guests. All guests will continue to register via the form on Ginkgo Go. We will continue to take the driver\u2019s licenses of guests to hold until they leave campus. VACCINATION AND BOOSTER SHOTS More than 86% of students and more than 90% of our campus community is fully vaccinated. We encourage everyone to become vaccinated and boosted. The likelihood of a variant of the virus returning at some point is high, and the best way to protect our community is to be fully vaccinated. Updated as of Feb. 16, 2022 HealthCheck As in the fall term, we continue to use BSC HealthCheck to record individuals\u2019 COVID-related issues. If you have symptoms, do not assume they are due to allergies, the weather, or other causes. Immediately report your symptoms, a positive test, or exposure by: 1. Clicking on MyBSC on the BSC home page 2. Clicking on BSC HealthCheck at the bottom of the dropdown list 3. Submitting all relevant information. In-Person, Hybrid, or Online Classes From time to time, faculty will be exposed to or infected with COVID-19 and will need to teach online. We may have a situation where most of a class is infected or exposed, and the entire class will need to go online. We are asking faculty to use their best judgment when deciding to go hybrid or online. Our clear preference is to maintain physical presence in the classrooms. Similarly, many of our students may need to be quarantined or isolated for periods of time. We ask faculty to be as flexible as possible with these students, in many instances effectively creating a hybrid class for a few sessions. Vaccination We encourage all students to be vaccinated. We encourage those who have been vaccinated and whose second dose was at least six months ago to receive the booster shot. We will continue to define \u201Cvaccinated\u201D as an initial course without a booster. We will not require disclosure of vaccination status. Those who disclose will have slightly more lenient protocols. Booster shots are available on campus at Health Services. Campus Data More than 86% of students and more than 90% of our campus community is fully vaccinated, as of Feb. 16, 2022. The week of Feb. 14, 2022, we tested more than 700 students and 200 faculty and staff members, for a positivity rate of 0.33%. (Approximately 25% of students and employees were exempt due to positive cases in the past 90 days.) Testing details: 2 positives out of 738 total student tests 1 positive out of 197 employee tests 3 positives out of 935 total tests, for a 0.32 rate Since November 2021, BSC has recored 235 reported student positives, and 51 reported employee positives. If you recently received initial vaccinations or have not yet reported any vaccination, please do so through our COVID-19 Vaccination Report Form. Students, faculty and staff, report positive COVID tests or symptoms through BSC HealthCheck. If you have not previously done so, report a positive COVID test through the COVID-19 Positive Report Form. If you have received a booster, report it through our COVID-19 Booster Report Form. As a reminder, you are still considered fully vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of Johnson & Johnson. We are tracking booster doses to understand the impact of the recent surge in COVID-19 within our BSC community. Testing TESTING & ISOLATION\/QUARANTINE Anyone who is symptomatic should continue to report symptoms to HealthCheck or visit Health Services. Health Services will administer rapid and PCR tests as appropriate for individuals\u2019 circumstances. Students will continue to quarantine until the results are received. The protocols for isolation will remain the same with one exception: Starting tomorrow, we will allow students to quarantine\/isolate in their dorm rooms. Hanson Hall will no longer serve as our COVID infirmary. Symptomatic\/Exposed Testing All individuals who report symptoms or exposure must test following our protocols. Symptomatic individuals must test as soon as possible after they are guided toward testing by a BSC staff member who follows up on their BSC HealthCheck submission. Tests are available in Health Services at our Cahaba Medical Care Clinic, or you may obtain testing off-campus. Initial rapid tests are sufficient if positive results occur, but if the first test result is negative, a PCR test will be required to confirm the negative result. The symptomatic individual will be required to avoid contact with others until the PCR results return. The contact-tracing team will support them with contact with faculty members and other essential needs during their period of removal. (Note: The information below was updated on Jan. 18, 2022) Process When Positive All positive individuals will receive guidance on isolation from the contact tracing team. They will be expected to isolate in Hanson Hall if they share a residential space with others who are not positive, on their own in an apartment or suite if they live alone or all residents are positive, or away from campus. In all instances, the contact tracing team will support them with contact with faculty members and other essential needs during their isolation period. Isolation 5 days from initial antigen test. After 5 days and 24 hours without fever and other symptoms improving, individual may leave isolation but must wear a mask in all circumstances around other people for another 5 days. Process When Exposed All exposed individuals will receive guidance from the BSC contact tracing team regarding testing. Individuals who are fully vaccinated and in close contact with an infected person will be tested with a rapid antigen process on approximately the fifth day from exposure, unless symptoms emerge sooner. If they have updated their vaccination with a booster, they will only need to test if symptoms emerge. They will not be quarantined unless the exposed person tests positive. Vaccinated = no quarantine + test on day 5 + wear mask around other people for 10 days Boosted = no quarantine or test + wear mask around other people for 10 days Exposed individuals who are not vaccinated may need to test daily if circumstances indicate that is best. In most instances, we will NOT need to test an exposed individual daily. If after five days, they remain asymptomatic, we will expect them to test with a rapid test on their own or through our on-campus clinic before we officially clear them from our monitoring list. A PCR test may also be required if the contact tracing team deems it helpful. Unvaccinated=5-day quarantine+ negative antigen test + 5 day mask If symptomatic at any time = antigen test, if positive, isolate = antigen test, if negative, PCR test (if positive isolate; if negative back to quarantine protocols) The contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation process will determine the appropriate timeline for testing based on each situation. For anyone exposed who begins to show symptoms, they will be expected to test immediately and isolate until results are returned. Generally, individuals who are exposed but have no symptoms will be able to engage in regular activities while closely watching their symptoms.
