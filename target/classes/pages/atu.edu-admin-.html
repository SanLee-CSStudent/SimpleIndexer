The audit identified 30 different energy conservations options. The projects were prioritized and in October 2018, ATU contracted with Performance Services Inc. to implement Phase I of an energy savings project. This first phase includes LED lighting retrofit of all interior and exterior lighting, building automation integration, new lab fume hood and kitchen hood retrofit plus safety projects, and a new energy leadership program. Phase I is underway and should be completed by May 2019. https:\/\/www.arkansastechnews.com\/university\/atu-implements-energy-saving-measures\/ MASTER PLANNING Arkansas Tech University embarked on an exciting new chapter in its history with the adoption of its strategic plan in 2016. The master planning process was started shortly after the completion of the strategic plan and was influenced significantly by that and other recent planning efforts. The intention of this campus master plan was clear: to take stock of the institution and chart a path forward. The outcome is a visionary 20-year master plan with phased priorities in the near term and a catalog of long term potential projects that form a strong framework but also allow for flexible implementation based on predicted enrollment. The focus for the master plan was to prioritize near term needs that directly align with the academic mission, and mission support (which is critical to recruitment and retention), while identifying opportunities for longer term facilities that leave the university in a state of financial, facility, and environmental health.
