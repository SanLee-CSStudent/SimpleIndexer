Welcome to Campus Police Department. The AWC Campus Police Department is an accredited state police agency, having been recognized as a government entity and receiving all rights and powers by authority of the State of Arizona. As such, the department maintains rights and authority to enforce all campus rules, city ordinances, and state and federal criminal statutes. Our Mission The mission of the AWC Police Department is to provide a safe working, learning, and living environment for the faculty, staff, and students at AWC. We are committed to providing high-quality, community-oriented police service. We believe that by practicing the principles of community-oriented policing, we will best achieve a feeling of security in our campus community. We believe that the strength of our department lies in our employees, and we encourage and seek diversity in our workforce. The mission will be achieved through leadership, education, and quality improvements with constant performance monitoring. Message From Our Chief of Police Hello and welcome to Arizona Western College! Also, on behalf of the AWC Campus Police Department family, I\u2019d like to welcome you to our web site. The AWC Police Department is a full-service public law enforcement agency comprised of sworn peace officers, civilian security personnel, and our dispatch center. The sworn officers are fully certified by the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board and have the same authority and responsibility as any other police officer. Our primary jurisdiction is the Yuma main campus and outlying college properties, including the Redondo, San Luis, and Parker sites. However, we have agreements established with other local law enforcement agencies where we assist in proactive patrolling and enforcement of criminal and traffic laws in those areas adjacent to our jurisdiction. Our web page has several resources to assist you when you are on any of the campus properties. As you browse, we hope you will learn about programs that encourage citizen participation in a community policing environment. The police department cares deeply for the different communities we serve in both Yuma and La Paz Counties. We are committed to ensuring all students, staff members, and visitors to AWC are able to focus on conducting their business in an environment that is safe and welcoming. I am proud to say that the men and women of the AWC Police Department are dedicated to providing that safe and secure environment for all who live at, work at, and visit our institution. We look forward to your questions, comments, and suggestions. Thank you for visiting the AWC Police Department web page. Sincerely, Stephen D.
