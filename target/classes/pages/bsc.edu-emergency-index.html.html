Birmingham-Southern has a number of ways to keep students, faculty, staff, and parents informed of weather alerts, school closures, and other emergency situations on or near campus: BSC Text Alerts\u2014Cell phone numbers entered into TheSIS will be automatically put into our emergency text alert system. Texts will come from \u201CBSC Alert.\u201D Go to the IT helpdesk for directions to enter your number into TheSIS (open the \"How do I get Emergency Text Messages?\" accordion). Parents, please urge your students to check their information. Campus Alerts Verification - submit and update emergency alert contact information. Our campus hotline, (205)226-3000, will have the college\u2019s most up-to-date emergency information and operational status. It may be more current than the web site in the case of widespread power outages or server failures. The college\u2019s Facebook page and Twitter account will also carry updated information in case of weather or other closures or delays. For more information, read the college\u2019s entire Emergency Response Manual, which outlines our approach to any situation. Tornado directions are posted in each building on campus. Members of the BSC community should use their discretion in judging the safety of traveling to campus during dangerous weather. Details on the inclement weather response plan can be found here. The Office of Communications will also notify local media outlets regarding closings and delays.
