She is a Hilltop living legend \u2013 and our longtime campus queen \u2013 whose compassion has been unmatched during her 43 years at the College. To most people on campus, Hawkins says, her life outside of campus coffee shop Panther Perk is no surprise. \u201CYou know I love to talk,\u201D she says, \u201Cand I lay it all out. It\u2019s just conversations all day long.\u201D Those who know Hawkins know one of her favorite places is New Hope Baptist Church in the West End, where quite a few students have gone to church with her over the years. They know that when Hawkins isn\u2019t on campus, she loves to walk, and looks closely at all the flowers and plants along her regular walking trails. They know she likes things that are happy and funny, like her favorite TV shows and movies, including \u201CThe Andie Griffith Show,\u201D \u201CLeave it to Beaver,\u201D and anything Tyler Perry. And she\u2019s always laughing, whether it\u2019s with her family around the kitchen table or with students, faculty, and staff on campus. For Hawkins, the BSC community has the same impact on her personal life that it has on her workday. Family is important to Hawkins, and BSC students become a part of her family, exchanging cards and replacing April Fools\u2019 Day with celebrations for Hawkins\u2019 birthday on April 1. \u201CI have the chance to meet parents, grandmas, nanas, the whole nine yards,\u201D she says. \u201CI get to see them graduate and then have children, and their children come here.\u201D Ever since Hawkins was a child, friends and family have always confided in her. She is one of nine children in her family \u2013 the oldest girl with five brothers and three sisters \u2013 and always knows how to make them laugh. She was the peacemaker between her friends during her school days in Greenville, Alabama, and she can always turn to someone with her wisdom. She\u2019s been the same welcoming, comforting, and joyful presence in her different roles at BSC \u2013 she began working in the cafeteria in 1979, spent 14 or so years in residential quad dining, and now handcrafts caramel macchiatos as the Panther Perk barista. And her positivity extends far outside of class and past graduation. \u201CThey come in and call me their sunshine,\u201D Hawkins says. \u201CPeople say, \u2018Do you always have a good day?\u2019 And I say I try to have a good day no matter what. It doesn\u2019t take much to make me happy \u2014 if somebody\u2019s having a bad day, and I can say one sentence to that person that changes their day, then I\u2019m happy.\u201D This story was published in the Fall\/Winter 2021 issue of \u2019Southern, BSC\u2019s alumni magazine.
