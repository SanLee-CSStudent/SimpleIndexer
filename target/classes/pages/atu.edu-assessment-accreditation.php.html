HLC is recognized by both the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and the United States Department of Education (USDE). Arkansas Tech has maintained continuous accreditation since 1930. Our last reaffirmation visit occurred during the 2020-2021 academic year and was successful. Our next reaffirmation visit will occur during the 2030-2031 academic year. Maintaining accreditation also requires additional points of interaction with HLC and the university will undergo an Assurance Review in 2024-25 as well as conducing a three-year Quality Initiative Project starting in 2025.
