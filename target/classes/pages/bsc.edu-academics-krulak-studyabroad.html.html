An expanded worldview translates to better performance in courses, better preparation for future jobs, and increased ability to collaborate effectively with others. At BSC, there are three ways to study abroad: course-based travel projects; term or year study abroad programs; and independent study abroad experiences. Contact Krulak Institute staff to find out more. Why study abroad? Experience the world. Going abroad prompts comparisons between cultures and groups, expanding your capacity to connect with others. Explore your values. Studying abroad stimulates reflection on why you value what you value and how you have been shaped by your social environment. Test your resilience. Studying abroad stretches your capacity for decision-making and responsibility, providing new insight into skills and abilities. Practice humility. Studying abroad requires reliance on others, highlighting the necessity of interdependence and cooperation among individuals, institutions, and nations. How do I go abroad? Course-Based Study-Travel Experience Participate in faculty-led, short-term travel projects during the regular term or Exploration Term, with some projects lasting three weeks or more. Travel projects for the upcoming year are announced each spring and published in the annual travel bulletin; students register during the registration period. Learn More Term or Year Study Abroad Experience Spend the term or year taking courses at an international partner institution or complete a virtual international experience. Identify where you want to study abroad the year prior to going abroad; students will enroll in a study abroad course the term prior to travel. Learn More Contracted Study Abroad Experience Contract an individualized study abroad experience where you conduct research, complete an internship, or enroll in an individualized program. Collaborate with faculty and Krulak Institute staff to develop a learning contract; completed contracts are due at registration for the upcoming term. Learn More Dive Deeper: Course-Based Study-Travel Experience Course-based study-travel projects integrate travel with course readings, reflections, and lectures. Travel can last anywhere from one to three weeks. Most course-based study travel projects are offered during Exploration Term. However, some projects are offered during the regular term and in the summer session, with students travelling near the end or halfway through the course. Students in any major and at any class standing may participate in course-based study travel projects. Travel expenses range from $2,500-$5,500, which includes airfare, lodging, and most (if not all) meals. Exploration Term travel projects will be promoted in the spring prior to the scheduled Exploration Term. Students can begin securing spots in these projects in the spring, but projects will remain open until full or until late September, whichever comes first. Students secure a spot by placing a deposit and completing a travel agreement form. Additional information about Exploration Term travel projects can be found here. If you have questions, reach out to Krulak Institute staff. Regular and summer-term travel projects will be indicated in Self-Service, announced in Monday Morning, and promoted through other campus message boards. To enroll in a regular term or summer term project, students register for the course during the regular registration process and then complete a travel agreement form. Reach out the instructor of the course or to the Krulak Institute as soon as possible if you are interested in completing a regular or summer term travel project. Term or Year Study Abroad Experience Studying abroad means that students enroll at colleges or universities outside of the United States for a single term or a full year. Courses completed transfer back to BSC. Credits earned can be used to fulfill BSC graduation requirements and, with prior approval, may be used to fulfill major, minor, distinction, and general education requirements. Students can study abroad during the fall, spring, or summer terms, or they may consider a full academic year from the fall through the spring. Students have two different program options for studying abroad: exchange and direct enrollment. Exchange : In an exchange program, students pay tuition to Birmingham-Southern at the same rate as if the student were enrolled on campus. Room and board expenses are not typically incorporated into the exchange. However, when students participate in an exchange program, federal loans or scholarships students receive through BSC will apply to the tuition and fees. BSC maintains exchange agreements with several institutions located within the UK, Western Europe, and east Asia. Direct Enrollment : In direct enrollment, students enroll directly with the international institution or one of our partnership programs. Students pay fees directly to the institution or program. Prices range from $4,000-$16,000, depending on destination and length of study. Need-based financial aid may be applied in some cases; merit-based scholarships do not apply. Students can select from a wide range of programs worldwide. How do I study abroad for a term or year? Deciding when and how long to study abroad can be a big decision, but with the support of your academic advisor and Krulak Institute staff, your decision will be easier. The sooner you start planning for your study abroad experience, the better. The main steps to studying abroad include: meeting with faculty and staff to get advice; reviewing the exchange and program options; completing the study-abroad application, organizing your finances and travel needs; and enrolling in IS 101 Study Abroad. Seek advice from faculty or staff.Plan early by making an appointment with your academic advisor and Krulak Institute staff. With your academic advisor, review your degree requirements to discuss how studying abroad can help you fulfill expectations. Review program options. On your own and in conjunction with Krulak Institute staff, review the different program options. Consider the institution or program's location, cost, academic programs and majors, and campus life. A list of our program options and institutions can be found here Complete the Study Abroad Application.Once you have clarified your plans, complete the BSC application for study abroad available on ENGAGE. This application gathers the necessary information for application to your specific program, as well as initiates your application for scholarships and aid. Make a financial plan.Once you have applied, review the costs associated with your selected program and how you plan to pay for expenses. Contact Krulak Institute staff for specific tools to assist in your financial planning. Travel scholarships are available to all BSC students. The deadline for the scholarship application coincides with the application for study abroad. More information about paying for study abroad experiences can be found here. Fulfill visa or passport requirements. Every country has a different set of visa or passport requirements. Review these requirements early in your process. Getting your first passport can take 10-12 weeks; applying for a visa can be quicker, but you will want to apply well in advance of your program departure. A passport fund is available to defray costs. Contact the Krulak Institute staff for information. Enroll in IS 101 Study Abroad. To support the study abroad experience, students enroll in IS 101 Study Abroad the term prior to their departure. IS 101 begins in the second half of a regular term and continues until students return from their studies abroad. Register for IS 101 as part of the regular registration process in Self-Service. Contracted Study Abroad Experience Students can initiate a contracted, independent study experience abroad for any academic term. Students might choose this option if they have a specific project or destination in mind, but the existing program options do not fit their needs. Recent projects have included an internship at a hospital in Colombia and working at a rhino sanctuary in South Africa. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors in any major may contract a travel experience for academic credit. How do I complete an individualized study-abroad contract? Contact a staff member in the Krulak Institute for assistance in writing a study abroad proposal, identifying funding opportunities, and finding the right destination and itinerary to suit your needs. Contracts are due during registration for a given term. Most students contract a study-abroad experience for the Exploration Term or summer. During the regular terms, students might contract a virtual international internship. Tuition for study during Exploration Term, fall, and spring is covered in standard tuition. Summer tuition (if applicable) as well as the cost of flights, lodging, and meals would be determined by the student. Students contracting an experience have access to scholarship and other aid through the regular application process.
