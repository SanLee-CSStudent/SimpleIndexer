The value of crops, livestock, fruits and vegetables produced on Yuma County farms and ranches is an estimated $2.5 billion a year (2013 University of Arizona study). Military bases contribute substantially to the local economy with the Marine Corps Air Station and Yuma Proving Grounds located in the county. Tourism to Yuma County generates an estimated gross revenue of over $380 million per year. New and exciting light industry increases Yuma's diversification. The Mexican freeport of San Luis Rio Colorado is located 23 miles southwest of Yuma. For an industry interested in off shore manufacturing, or twin-plant operation, San Luis offers all facilities necessary for a modern manufacturing operation.

Year round records show that Yuma receives an average of 93% of the possible 4,400 hours of sunshine yearly. This amounts to 4,133 hours of the sun's golden rays in an average year (not to mention the 11 extra hours on Leap Year). Yuma's climate is spectacular. The sun shines nearly every day. The air is clean and the vistas, sunrises and sunsets are majestic.
