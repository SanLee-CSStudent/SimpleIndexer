The Honors Day Convocation was held at 10 a.m. and recognized campus-wide honors that are presented each year. Throughout the rest of the day, departments and programs host their own award ceremonies, presentations, and celebrations to honor students within each discipline. Dr. Sima Lal Gupta \u201999 presented the 2022 Honors Day Convocation speech. President Daniel B. Coleman opened the morning convocation, followed by an invocation from Chaplain Julie Holly \u201903 and a salute to seniors from SGA President Laura Alice Hillhouse. Dr. Sima Lal Gupta \u201999, health services director of Aletheia House in Birmingham, served as the convocation speaker, a role that a graduate of the College assumes every year on Honors Day to present a message to the next class of alumni. Gupta explained how she was living vicariously through this year\u2019s seniors \u2013 she missed her own Honors Day in 1999 while she was abroad in Spain on a Rotary Scholarship, where she instead \u201Ctoasted to her years on the Hilltop on the Mediterranean.\u201D She also spoke about her lifelong focus on service \u2013 something BSC amplified in her own personal and professional life \u2013 and how it is a common thread throughout her education and dedication to public health. \u201CWe are each capable of doing something amazing,\u201D Gupta said to the senior class. \u201CNever doubt your potential, and never accept mediocrity. You have worked much too hard for that.\u201D Read Gupta\u2019s full speech here. Provost Tim Smith and student leaders presented several awards, and President Coleman announced the President\u2019s Service Awards, which honor faculty, staff, and students who have demonstrated commitment, character, service, and leadership in many areas of campus life. With each honoree, Coleman noted the many ways the recipients have impacted the BSC community. Jennifer Waters \u201986, director of alumni engagement, with President Coleman.
