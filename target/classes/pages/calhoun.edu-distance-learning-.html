Distance Learning courses at Calhoun are offered in two different formats, Hybrid and Web. A Hybrid course is one in which a majority of instruction is delivered online via the Internet but students do have to come to campus for one or more class sessions. Calhoun identifies Hybrid sections with an \u201CH\u201D in the course schedule. A Web course is one in which instruction is delivered entirely online through Blackboard, a learning management system. Students do not have to come to campus for any online classes but they may be required to take proctored exams at Calhoun\u2019s testing center or a pre-approved location. Calhoun identifies Web sections with a \u201CW\u201D in the course schedule. Both Hybrid and Web courses require that students have a reliable computer and high-speed Internet access. For further technical details, see Technical Requirements. Additionally, Distance Learning courses require computer literacy and excellent reading comprehension skills, as well as self-discipline and motivation.
