The Experiment Station contributes to Auburn University\u2019s land-grant mission of instruction, research and extension by seeking innovations and scientific discoveries that improve and protect the health and well-being of the citizens of Alabama, the nation and the world. AAES studies and the development and application of new technologies support and enhance Alabama agriculture, forestry and related business and industries and promote the environmentally and socially responsible development of Alabama\u2019s food and energy supplies, natural resources, communities and economies, while also addressing the most pressing health and social issues of the day. Research Focus Areas & Teams Solving the grand challenges of food and water security, health and the environment will require collaborations and teamwork. Research conducted by our faculty can be categorized into four broadly defined research systems (or focus areas) and 13 interdisciplinary teams. To learn more, click on the focus areas below. Food Animal Systems Research of Food Animal Systems including: animal breeding, reproduction and genetics; efficient and sustainable animal production systems and technologies; animal nutrition, immunity and health; and safe use of animal waste. Integrated Food & Human Health Systems Research of Integrated Food and Human Health Systems including: food safety and quality; rural, economic and community development; and human nutrition, health and obesity. Plant Production & Management Systems Research including plant production-cropping systems; plant protection and biosecurity; genetics and genomics for improved crop cultivars; soil fertility; plant-soil-microbial interactions; agricultural technologies, innovations and data-driven decision systems; and impact of agricultural systems on the ecosystem. Sustainable Ecosystems & Renewable Resource Management Research including biodiversity and landscapes; ecosystem services and preservation; alternative crops; bioproducts and renewable resources; water and aquatic resources; novel approaches to create value-added products; natural resource conservation and management; and climate change. Research & Extension Centers Total Number of Research Trials: COA & AAES Increase Interdisciplinary Research Collaborations The College of Agriculture and Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station have implemented a systems approach to facilitate interdisciplinary research between departments, research stations and institutes identifying four broad areas of exploration. Twelve interdisciplinary teams of collaborating researchers have been assembled to research the areas with the goal of accelerating scientific discoveries and innovations to complex problems.
