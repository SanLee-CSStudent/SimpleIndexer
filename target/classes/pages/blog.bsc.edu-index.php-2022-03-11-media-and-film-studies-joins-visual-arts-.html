This merger marks a time of growth for MFS faculty and students and the continuation of interdisciplinary learning in film and art. Dr. Teddy Champion, assistant professor of media and film studies and director of the program, has built strong relationships with fine and performing arts faculty since he arrived at BSC in 2016. Many art, theatre, and music faculty were involved in creating the MFS major and have been longtime supporters of the program. \u201CWhen I formed the MFS Advisory Committee, we wanted to raise the level of ambition for our course offerings and student projects, and I definitely wanted representatives from fine and performing arts faculty to give me a sense of what is possible,\u201D Champion says. Almost two years ago, Dr. Kathleen Spies, professor of art history and former department chair, approached Champion and Robert Corna, assistant professor of media and film studies, about MFS merging with art and art history. At that point, MFS was a program with two faculty members, and having a place in an existing department presented the opportunity for more growth. MFS graduate Damian Mitchell \u201918 forged a path in sports media and now works as a producer and radio host at WJOX 94.5. \u201CWe liked the idea of maintaining the MFS program, with me remaining as program director, but being part of a department that could benefit from all the programs and artistic areas involved, including photography, painting, 2D and 3D design, and architecture,\u201D Champion says. Now, students in the Department of Art and Art History can choose to major or minor in studio art, art history, media and film studies, or architecture studies \u2013 another new addition to the department with its first graduate in 2020. Together, the majors will become part of the Department of Visual Arts as MFS completes its transition. \u201CFor me, the intangible benefit will be regular interaction with faculty working in an array of artistic media,\u201D Champion says. \u201CMFS has always been an interdisciplinary program, and I want to constantly learn and reinforce our ability to work across various forms of expression.\u201D Champion and Corna regularly work with fine arts faculty as well as theatre and music faculty, the disciplines often overlapping in focuses on sound, acting, design, and composition. MFS students already take photography courses with Pamela Venz, professor of art, and MFS 341: Acting and Directing for the Camera is co-taught by Corna and Dr. Alan Litsey, professor of theatre. Collaborations will continue to grow through the department and extend to music, theatre, and musical theatre. \u201CI believe there are similarities in the creative processes and theory of the two disciplines,\u201D says Kevin Shook, professor of art and current department chair. \u201CA singular department that contains all of the programs allows us to think about these similarities and develop a more interdisciplinary future.\u201D MFS graduate Hope Martin \u201921 interviewed Alabama Governor Kay Ivey for her senior capstone project, a documentary on female politicians. Since 2010, MFS has successfully introduced students to the film industry while they are college students, preparing them for the wide range of careers in media and film. The program founded the annual Hilltop Film Festival of Diversity and Inclusion in 2020, screening films from around the world, and has seen students produce award-winning work and earn incredible real-world film experience. One recent success story is senior MFS major Natalie Justus, who won the George Lindsey UNA Film Festival\u2019s feature screenplay award for her screenplay, \u201CDeath of a Bachelor,\u201D in March. Last summer, Justus also had the opportunity to work and attend the Cannes Film Festival through an internship with The American Pavilion, the hospitality and communications hub for the thousands of Americans attending the festival. Justus is just one example of how MFS students and graduates find success in the classroom to take into their careers. Hope Martin \u201921, now on the editorial and videography team for Bake From Scratch Magazine, directed and filmed a documentary on female politicians in Alabama for her senior capstone project, interviewing Alabama Governor Kay Ivey and other influential political figures. Another recent MFS graduate Damian Mitchell \u201918 was featured in \u2019Southern Magazine for his work in radio. As a football player and MFS major during his time at BSC, Mitchell forged a path in sports media through the program and now works as a producer and radio host at WJOX 94.5. Champion hopes to see current and future MFS majors benefit from closer proximity to the arts and the study of all kinds of media. \u201CEveryone was supportive of our ideas and wants the best for our students,\u201D Champion says.
