I received a certificate in the mail, but have not finished my degree. Why did I receive this? In an effort to make sure students receive every credential they earn while at Calhoun, you may be auto-awarded certain certificates as you complete your requirements towards your degree. When is the graduation ceremony? The graduation ceremony is held once a year in May. My GPA is below a 2.0. Can I graduate? An overall grade point average of 2.0 is required to earn your degree. We recommend you see an advisor or Admissions staff member to discuss eligibility for course forgiveness or academic bankruptcy to help raise your GPA. Note: You may not bankrupt a course that is applying towards your degree. In addition, you are eligible to participate in the ceremony and complete your requirements the following term. I did not pass a class needed for graduation. Am I allowed to participate in the ceremony? Yes. Grades will be verified after the ceremony and any needed courses may be taken the following term to earn your degree. How will honors be determined? You must complete at least 24 hours at Calhoun to be eligible for honors. Only grades from courses required for the degree are considered when determining graduation honors (Degrees: Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, and Summa Cum Laude; Certificates: With Distinction). Grades from courses that are not counted towards your degree are omitted in this calculation. I have been awarded multiple degrees and\/or certificates. How will I be recognized during the ceremony? Students who have earned multiple awards (degrees and\/or certificates) will only have the highest earned acknowledged during the ceremony. (ex: If a student has earned both an Associate degree and a certificate, the Associate degree will be announced at the ceremony.) Students will receive diplomas for each degree and\/or certificate earned via mail.
