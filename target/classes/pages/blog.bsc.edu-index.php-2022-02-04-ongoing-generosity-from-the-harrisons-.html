The program received a significant gift from Dr. Donald C. Harrison \u201954 that will provide continual support to honors students and their academic goals. Harrison\u2019s gift adds to his 14-year commitment to the honors program and 35 years of unwavering support to his alma mater. This academic year has been a particularly good one for the Harrison Honors Program with an excellent start from Dr. Will Hustwit, Associate Professor of History and Honors Program Director, who began overseeing the program in fall 2021. Dr. Will Hustwit in his honors class. \u201CThe Harrison Honors Program adds breadth, depth, and complexity to the student\u2019s education at BSC,\u201D Hustwit says. \u201CThe ideal honors student is intellectually curious, knows how to make distinctions and ask thoughtful questions, enjoys reading, recognizes weak or sloppy arguments, including his or her own, and loves learning.\u201D Students in the program enroll in honors-specific curriculum designed to promote discussion in and out of the classroom. The program culminates in the honors capstone, for which students work on individual projects outside of their majors with faculty mentors. As of this year, honors students also have access to a newly renovated Honors Commons along with the same small, interdisciplinary classes that have always been part of the program. Raised in Blount County, Dr. Harrison was encouraged by his mother to pursue his academic and athletic interests, leading to his entry in an oratorical contest held at BSC that provided a one-year scholarship to the winner. After his selection for the award, he attended BSC, and he looks to his solid, interdisciplinary education as an important part of his life. The Harrison Honors Program\u2019s emphasis on academic curiosity reflects Dr. Harrison\u2019s own passions throughout his education and career. Harrison served as chief cardiologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine for 19 years and as senior vice president of medicine and provost at the University of Cincinnati for 17 years, and he saw extraordinary medical advancements and educational programs in both positions. The College honored him as a Distinguished Alumnus in 1972 and awarded him an honorary Doctor of Law degree in 1996, when he served as a commencement speaker. Dr. Harrison and his late wife, Laura McAnnally Harrison, chose to help other students following in his footsteps, and he and his family continue to support students on the Hilltop as a testament to his own experience. Newly renovated Harrison Commons. Lauren Barnett, a senior economics major and honors student, was drawn to the Harrison Honors Program because of its interdisciplinary focus. When she first came to BSC, she was not sure what she wanted to study or pursue after college, and honors courses allowed her to explore multiple options. \u201CThe Honors Program offered not only a wide range of courses \u2013 from photography to religion to natural sciences \u2013 but also courses that focus on interdisciplinary learning,\u201D Barnett says. \u201CThis allowed me to simultaneously explore multiple disciplines in one course and see what subjects I was passionate about far more quickly.\u201D Thanks to the generosity of the Harrison family, the program also offers financial support for student research, which has elevated Barnett\u2019s honors capstone. For her research, Barnett will study ethical production within the craft chocolate market in contrast to mass chocolate producers like Hershey, Mars, and Nestle that are linked with unsustainable production methods. The Harrison Honors Program provided her with a stipend that covered her professional chocolate tasting certification and travel expenses to Boston, where she visited several craft chocolate factories. In addition to senior research stipends, Hustwit hopes to create additional financial awards and scholarships to support honors students. He is also looking forward to next fall\u2019s Honors Convocation with inaugural speaker Dr. Randall Kennedy, Michael R. Klein Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, who will give a campus-wide talk on race in contemporary America. Barnett is grateful for the ways the honors program has enhanced her education. As the student facilitator, she has worked alongside Hustwit on new changes this year and has seen the program thrive over her four years at BSC. \u201CThe Honors Program truly embodies what a liberal arts education should be and perfectly complements the stellar education that Birmingham-Southern already offers,\u201D Barnett says. \u201CEvery professor who has created an honors course is adamant about including perspectives from multiple disciplines and emphasizing the importance of exploring multiple points of view on one topic. Through this, the Honors Program produces a community of both professors and students that loves learning for the sake of learning and appreciates a wide array of disciplines and perspectives.\u201D Categories \u2019Southern Admission Alumni Engagement Athletics Business and Economics Campus Culture Class Notes Education Event Spotlight Faculty Excellence Fine and Performing Arts Giving to BSC Health Professions Humanities Law Math and Applied Computer Science Modern Foreign Languages Natural Sciences Notes From Munger Religious Studies and Ministry Service Learning Social Sciences Student Life Study Abroad Welcome Blog Meta Log in Entries feed Comments feed WordPress.org ? 2022 THE BSC BLOG.
