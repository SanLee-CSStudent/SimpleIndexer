Only four years out of college and the Birmingham-based country music singer\/songwriter has already been in some impressive rooms. In 2020, Cato made her Country Music Television debut on a \u201CConcert for Love & Acceptance\u201D \u2013 Grammy nominee and Dove Award winning country star Ty Herndon created the annual concert with GLAAD in 2015, and past performers have included Reba McEntire, Jake Owen, Mickey Guyton, and Tanya Tucker. Cato also was the 2019 recipient of GLAAD\u2019s National Rising Star award for her commitment to enhancing LGBTQ representation. Cato\u2019s range of talents is impressive \u2013 she plays the guitar, piano and ukulele. She has been seen across the country in \u201CLegally Blonde,\u201D \u201CInto the Woods,\u201D and \u201CSing Out!\u201D She has also appeared in commercials for companies like State Farm and Adopt-A-Highway, and skits for \u201CIt\u2019s A Southern Thing.\u201D Her songwriting sessions with Nashville producer, songwriter, and musician Erik Halbig, who has written songs for Sara Evans, Collin Raye and more, led to her recording her first EP with Halbig at the helm. A Georgia native, Cato was a theatre major and religion minor and says her Hilltop experience prepared her well for taking the stage, in venues around Birmingham and across the country. \u201CIn country music, performance-wise, having a good awareness of yourself and of others on stage and knowing how to navigate to stage is huge,\u201D she says. \u201CDance was a huge part of my training, and something that I like to incorporate into my shows now as well.\u201D She says BSC prepared her for the business side of country music, too. \u201CThey teach you to stay one step ahead of the game. And that\u2019s what you have to do in this business. The hardest class that I took was probably my theatre literature class. I learned so much. The professors really care, so they push you. They also give you a lot of grace.\u201D This story was published in the Fall\/Winter 2021 issue of \u2019Southern, BSC\u2019s alumni magazine.
