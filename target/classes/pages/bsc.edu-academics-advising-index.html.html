What am I prepared for? What's required of me? The traditional view of advising is that you get \u201Cadvice\u201D from your advisor. In this view, information flows one way. At Birmingham-Southern College, however, advising is an ongoing dialogue between you and your advisor, assisted by a student-peer advisor, with the purpose of identifying and developing your academic aspirations and facilitating your growth. The primary goal of advising is to help you meet your graduation requirements in a way that best suits your needs, career goals, and academic interests. Advising ranges from helping you pinpoint your individual interests and academic goals, identifying your vocation, taking advantage of the tools to academic success BSC offers, planning for graduate study, and directing you to other opportunities, from internships to extracurricular activities. If you need additional help identifying your personal aspirations and academic goals, you may want to turn to the Office of Counseling and Health Services. If you need additional assistance in setting career goals or planning for your chosen profession, contact the BSC Career Counseling Office. The assistance you get from these offices can inform you discussions with your advisor as you plan your course of study.
