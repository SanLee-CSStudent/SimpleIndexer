Copeland Before Miles Axe Copeland III \u201966 produced some of the biggest names of the new wave scene \u2013 The Police, The Bangles, The Go-Go\u2019s, and R.E.M. \u2013 he was a political science student at Birmingham-Southern, a world away from where he grew up. The son of CIA officer Miles Axe Copeland, Jr.,\u201941, and Lorraine Adie, a British secret intelligence agent and archaeologist, Copeland and his young siblings spent his childhood in Damascus, Cairo, and Beirut. But when the time came to choose a college, he traveled across the world to his father\u2019s alma mater and hometown, where many family members still lived. \u201CMy father wanted me to know what real America was,\u201D Copeland says. He covers the Birmingham years near the beginning of his memoir, \u201CTwo Steps Forward, One Step Back: My Life in the Music Business,\u201D released in July 2021. The book chronicles his failures and successes as the music and entertainment executive who managed The Police, guided Sting\u2019s music and acting career, and co-founded I.R.S. Records, the label for some of the most popular bands of the 1980s. An American Education Arriving in the American South during the Civil Rights Movement, Copeland says he was shocked to witness discrimination he thought he had left in Beirut \u2013 only this was fueled by race rather than religion. Copeland says his experience in Birmingham both disrupted and informed his identity. Having seen so much of the world through his family\u2019s moves around the Middle East and his father\u2019s role in covert operations, including coups d\u2019etat in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, he remembers being shocked to meet Alabamians who had rarely or never left the South. Most, he recalls, were unfamiliar with the places he called home. BSC prepared Copeland for graduate work at the American University of Beirut and was an important introduction to the United States, the place where punk and new wave music would later be embraced with open arms, and which helped shape his career. The Family Business In 1967, Copeland \u201Cfell into music.\u201D At the time, his brother, Stewart \u2013 who would eventually rise to fame as the drummer for The Police \u2013 was playing with Wichita Vortex Sutra, a local band in Beirut. Miles was known for throwing parties, so Stewart brought him on to create a psychedelic atmosphere for one of their shows, completed with black lights and fluorescent paint that covered everyone in the crowd. Copeland, Mike Gormley, and the head of CBS with The Bangles in 1987. \u201CI\u2019d always been a big fan of music, but I never imagined anyone in my family being in music,\u201D Copeland says. \u201CThen I saw my brother up there drumming. My brain opened up to the idea.\u201D Eventually, his work in the music business snowballed: He relocated to London with his family, connected with musicians at clubs, soon managed his first group (Wishbone Ash), made record deals, and partnered with agencies. This work led to Startruckin\u2019 75, the festival that Copeland calls, \u201Can unmitigated, pull-the-rug-from-under-you, clean-out-the-bank-account disaster.\u201D But as Copeland makes clear throughout his memoir, the low points and frequent crises shaped him into a manager willing to take risks, especially as \u201Cnew wave\u201D music began to take form. \u201CI found myself befriending the punks because they didn\u2019t care if I had any money,\u201D he says. \u201CIt was in a time when the mainstream business figured this whole new wave punk thing was a fad that would disappear, yet it was really a new generation perking up saying, \u2018We want our heroes, and we want to do it our way.\u2019 I recognized that and was one of the first to actually pay attention.\u201D When he brought The Police to New York, he saw \u201Cpeople begin to wake up\u201D to their music. The group recorded their first album in 1978 and together \u2013 the Copelands, Sting, and guitarist Andy Summers \u2013 offered something no one had ever experienced before, in sound and in presence. The Police brought a fusion of punk, jazz, and reggae, and Copeland booked tours to places no one else was going and developed their iconic mystique. \u201CThe show that did change our lives was to four people in northern New York,\u201D Copeland says, \u201Cbecause one of the four happened to be a DJ, who fell in love with the group and started banging the single on the radio.\u201D In the world of music and business, Copeland says instinct and gut feeling work. \u201CYou can have an idea and do it on your own,\u201D he says. \u201CSome of the strangest stuff I did was some of the most successful.\u201D Returning to the Hilltop With his success, Birmingham was never completely forgotten. He still has family in the area, including his cousin, Diane Copeland North \u201965, and has visited since his graduation from BSC. Miles and Ian Copeland at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. During a trip to Alabama in the \u201980s, Copeland visited his uncle Hunter Copeland and his wife, whose daughter from a previous marriage was a Mountain Brook High School graduate named Courteney Cox. Copeland connected Cox with his brother Ian \u2013 also a music promoter, booking agent, and the third Copeland on the new wave scene \u2013 who hired her as his secretary in New York. Cox went on to sign with Ford Modeling Agency and eventually rose to stardom on the hit sitcom \u201CFriends.\u201D Another time on tour, Copeland swung by campus to visit his old fraternity. \u201CWhen The Police were really big, we did a show in Birmingham, and I went to the SAE house and gave out free tickets,\u201D he says. \u201CIt was my opportunity to go back home and show how I made it.\u201D Lessons Learned Between the music industry and his proximity to huge international events during his childhood, Copeland had a rich bank of colorful stories to pull from for his book, which is part personal history and part motivational lessons. He writes that people are the same everywhere, that risk-taking pays off, and that you can never be too proud. The most central and universal lesson is that you\u2019ll always have successes and failures, but those failures could set you up for something greater and even more innovative \u2013 \u201CRoxanne\u201D-level great. \u201CMy real story starts with a disaster,\u201D Copeland writes in the preface, referencing the aforementioned Startruckin\u2019 75 festival-turned-fiasco. \u201CBut had it not happened, The Police would never have risen to become the biggest rock band in the world; Jools Holland would not have ended up on TV; The Bangles, The Go-Go\u2019s, R.E.M., and many other music stars might never have made it either. It\u2019s strange how a fluke, a disaster, an unlikely event can lead to incredible results. But that is in essence what happened to me.\u201D This story was published in the Fall\/Winter 2021 issue of \u2019Southern, BSC\u2019s alumni magazine.
