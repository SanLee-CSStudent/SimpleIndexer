This planned instrument will see things that conventional X-rays can't. The CXFEL will let scientists peer inside molecules, helping them create more effective drugs, find new sources of renewable energy, advance quantum computing, and even gain deep insight into archeological and artistic treasures without damaging them. The first phase of this project, the compact X-ray light source (CXLS), is nearly complete. ASU will collaborate with Mayo Clinic to use the CXLS for special medical imaging of soft tissues such as cancer biopsy samples.
