Her mom and most of her aunts are active members, and she grew up participating in the organization\u2019s programs for youth, leading up to the debutant ball put on by her mom\u2019s chapter, Epsilon Gamma Omega in Huntsville, during her senior year of high school. Lewis, a junior biology major at Birmingham-Southern, is now officially a member of the Hilltop\u2019s Nu Delta Chapter of AKA, which was rechartered in April 2021. As the chapter\u2019s president, Lewis led the organization through their first fall term. \u201CI knew I wanted to be a charter member because I wanted to have an impact on girls younger than me who might not understand or know about AKA,\u201D she says. \u201CI wanted to be able to reach out to people and see if they were interested, even before it was chartered.\u201D AKA first began with nine students at Howard University in 1908 and is the oldest intercollegiate historically African American sorority in the country. The Nu Delta Chapter was founded at BSC in 1979 and is sponsored and advised by Upsilon Eta Omega, the graduate chapter of AKA serving Fairfield and surrounding areas. Now, after nearly a decade since Nu Delta dissolved in 2013, students like Lewis and other Birmingham-area AKAs have worked hard to reestablish the sorority at BSC, especially throughout several slowdowns during the pandemic. \u201CI\u2019m connecting with people I wouldn\u2019t normally be connected with, and they get to reach out to other people,\u201D Lewis says. \u201CWe\u2019re all making an impact, and I\u2019m excited to grow awareness on campus.\u201D The new members at BSC have worked closely with graduate advisor Sakeena Smith to reintroduce the chapter, something Smith and others in Upsilon Eta Omega have been working toward for years. \u201CBeing a member of AKA is a lifetime commitment,\u201D Smith says. \u201CWe\u2019re always excited about service and looking for young ladies who are involved in community service.\u201D Smith has been a member of AKA for 46 years \u2013 she joined the University of Alabama\u2019s chapter in 1975, shortly after it was chartered. When she moved to Birmingham in 2015, she got involved with Upsilon Eta Omega \u2013 the largest of the Birmingham-area AKA chapters \u2013 and has served as a mentor for BSC students throughout the rechartering process. One aspect of AKA that both Lewis and Smith are looking forward to is the sorority\u2019s commitment to service. Initiatives in the community for undergraduate and graduate chapters follow five program targets: historically Black colleges and universities, women\u2019s healthcare and wellness, economic legacy, arts enrichment and culture, and global impact. Upsilon Eta Omega has served in Bush Hills and the West End through McCoy Adult Day Care and other organizations, so Smith is looking forward to continuing these partnerships with the BSC chapter close by and committed to the same community goals. \u201CTheir moms were AKAs, their aunts were AKAs, their grandmothers may have been AKAs,\u201D Smith says. \u201CThey grew up knowing that we are all about service and providing service to the community.\u201D One alumna who has also been involved in the rechartering process is Danielle Ridgeway \u201906, especially since she is part of Upsilon Eta Omega\u2019s grad advisor committee. \u201CWe have the opportunity to still work with Nu Delta and the young ladies that come forward in undergrad,\u201D she says. \u201CWe get to mentor and help shape them and help them learn about the sorority.\u201D Ridgeway serves as assistant treasurer for her chapter and was president of Nu Delta throughout her time at BSC. She was initiated in 2003 and took part in revitalizing the chapter. On the Hilltop, she was involved in residence life and the Black Student Union but wanted to be a part of an organization to connect her with more women at the College. \u201CI\u2019m excited to see the chapter reach its full potential,\u201D Ridgeway says. \u201CI think that the growth and sustainability will add to the Panhellenic family. All the organizations have goals about fostering relationships and service, but we all carry them out differently. It was great to be among that group and expose who AKA is and also learn about other organizations and how we can collaborate.\u201D During fall term, Nu Delta focused on planning for the year and growing awareness about the chapter through tables at student organization fairs and Homecoming. AKA recruitment requires at least one term on campus, so they plan to hold recruitment in the spring to give first-year students an opportunity to join. Their 2022 initiation will take place about one year from the rechartering, which was a huge moment for the Upsilon Eta Omega chapter and Nu Delta alumnae. Ridgeway attended the rechartering ceremony with other BSC graduates \u2013 including some of the founding members of Nu Delta \u2013 as well as AKA leaders from around the Southeast. \u201CIt reminded me where I was more than 15 years ago,\u201D Ridgeway says. \u201CIt was a tear-jerking moment to see the hard work we put in place come to fruition.\u201D Nu Delta Officers and Members 2021 Alex Lewis, Basileus (president) Tamrah Tucker, Anti Basileus (vice president) Genesis Turner, Grammateus (secretary) Aaliyah Hammond, Tamiochous (treasurer) J\u2019Shell Rice, Pecunious Grammateus (financial secretary) Alexanderia Huggins, Parliamentarian Victoria Terry, Ivy Leaf Reporter Lauren Boustani, member Jessica Boustani, member Taylor Fields, member Jaida Bolden, member Makayla Craig, member Hunter Smith, member Categories \u2019Southern Admission Alumni Engagement Athletics Business and Economics Campus Culture Class Notes Education Event Spotlight Faculty Excellence Fine and Performing Arts Giving to BSC Health Professions Humanities Law Math and Applied Computer Science Modern Foreign Languages Natural Sciences Notes From Munger Religious Studies and Ministry Service Learning Social Sciences Student Life Study Abroad Welcome Blog Meta Log in Entries feed Comments feed WordPress.org ? 2022 THE BSC BLOG.
