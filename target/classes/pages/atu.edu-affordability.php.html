Pope County, Arkansas, offers a low cost-of-living and several amenities. High graduation rates, high median earnings 10 years after college and reasonable tuition all add up to an incredible value. All while equipping graduates with a potent combination of education and skills that will enable them to excel in their chosen fields. Not an Arkansas resident? ATU waives out-of-state tuition for undergraduate students who are legal residents of states bordering Arkansas (Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Missouri, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Affordable food and housing, 750 on-campus jobs, affordable and often free entertainment options, and a campus location that provides easy access to it all means that your full college experience can cost a lot less at Arkansas Tech University. Live, learn, and save money all at the same time.
