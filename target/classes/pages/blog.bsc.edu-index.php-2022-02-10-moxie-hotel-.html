He watched them grow, eventually partnering up with rival musicians, and has seen the music evolve into the modern rock\/pop hybrid that is Moxie Hotel. Pewitt is the vocalist and bassist for Moxie Hotel, along with guitarists and vocalists Stanton Langley and Anderson Gore and drummer Sims Ruffino. They\u2019re bringing pop music \u201Cwithout losing that element of explosive, energetic rock\u201D to Birmingham and venues all over the east coast. \u201CMoxie Hotel has a couple regions to its style, but it largely centers around this ironic notion to take what we do very seriously, but not ourselves,\u201D Pewitt says. \u201CHence why some of the content may sound or look so dramatic, but if you come see us live, it\u2019s a lot of us laughing and interacting with the crowd.\u201D At Crestline Elementary and Mountain Brook Junior High, Pewitt and Langley crossed paths and began a few groups, leading to what Pewitt sees as their first real band, Riverbend. \u201CI introduced the band to Sims when we were 15, after rivaling his bands for years,\u201D Pewitt says. \u201CWe buried the hatchet and got busy quickly. After high school, it came time to decide how far we would be willing to take it.\u201D Pewitt, Langley, and Ruffino got a production deal in Nashville, which led them to find Gore, another local musician-turned bandmate. Together, the four members all bring a love for pop and rock and collectively channel that energy, while still bringing their own preferences and varying commitments to the rock roots \u2013 creating the equilibrium Pewitt likes about their style, which was set in stone once they added Gore. \u201CThat\u2019s really when we rebranded to Moxie Hotel and found our new sound, our vibe, and essentially started over with this lineup and our producers who stuck with us all the way through the madness of the pandemic and internal changes.\u201D Moxie has performed at several campus events, like E-Fest and Spring Bash, and has multiple ties to BSC: Pewitt transferred to the Hilltop in 2020, Ruffino attended BSC in 2018 and 2019, and his brother, Max Ruffino, is a current first-year student. Last summer, Moxie traveled to venues in Texas, Virginia, Georgia, and Washington, D.C. The musicians also played the Sloss Music and Arts Festival and with Cage the Elephant at the 1065 Music Festival in Mobile. They plan to keep traveling, and Pewitt is developing his business major to focus on marketing to help manage the band. \u201CIt is my friends, my career, my income, my passion \u2013 all tied into one project with a purpose to meet people of all kinds and include people in what we do,\u201D Pewitt says. \u201CIt\u2019s very cathartic to me knowing that whether I\u2019m in a business mood, a creative mood, or a social mood, I have an outlet to find a way to work it into the band.\u201D This story was published in the Fall\/Winter 2021 issue of \u2019Southern, BSC\u2019s alumni magazine.
