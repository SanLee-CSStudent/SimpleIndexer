A Student Experience Admir Balicevac was such an inspiration towards my decision in changing my degree. He believed in me and encouraged me. Ever since I realized that I wanted to change my major to Business with an emphasis in Marketing he reminded me of something very important that sticks with me every day and that is to never let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do because anything is possible if you work hard for it.
