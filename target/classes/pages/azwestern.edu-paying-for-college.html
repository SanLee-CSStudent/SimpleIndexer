Follow the steps on the BankMobile Disbursements page to select a refund preference. What is the difference between a withdrawal and a drop with refunds? Officially dropping classes before the end of the official drop\/add period ensures a student will not be charged. Dropping after the end of the official drop\/add period is counted as a Withdrawal and the student is still responsible for all charges. What is the drop deadline to still get a full refund? Drop deadlines vary depending on the schedule of each particular class. Students are responsible for checking the drop schedule for each class they are registered for as every class on their schedule does not necessarily have the same drop deadline.

Next, choose the button titled \"Proceed to Processor\" which will open in a new browser window or tab. Payment plans made through the AWC Payment Plan allow the college to make adjustments (i.e., increases and decreases) to your agreement and payment amounts according to NACHA guidelines. Students will be responsible for any additional costs incurred after the initial payment plan is completed. Can I stop the payment plan once it has started? A student cannot terminate a payment plan as long as they have an account balance. Once their account is paid in full, no further payment plan payments will be attempted. After dropping a class I paid for myself, do I automatically get mailed a refund? If a drop is eligible for a refund and it creates a credit on a student\u2019s account, the reimbursement will either be issued to the credit card used to pay or sent in a check to the address on file if the original payment was made by cash or check. No special request is needed for a refund to be processed. Can the Cashier\u2019s Office release financial aid funds? No. Please see someone in the Disbursement Office about financial aid funds. What about Residence Hall Charges? Students who plan to live in the residence hall are required to pay for their room and board before they are allowed to check-in. Students must be registered for a minimum of 12 credit hours to be eligible. A deposit of $100.00 and proof of immunizations are required before a room will be assigned. What happens to past due student accounts? Once the account has been deemed \u201Cuncollectible\u201D (typically after reaching 120 days past due) the account will be turned over to the College\u2019s collection agency or any other private or government agency\/program needed to collect the debt.
