We are obligated to abide by the policy. The following are the basic guidelines: Students wishing to withdraw from some of their classes must do so through MyCalhoun. Amounts that may be due students by the College as a result of dropping classes will be refunded as applicable after the 2nd week of the term as long as the student account balance is zero. Withdrawal Prior to Classes A student who withdraws from classes prior to the first day of class will be refunded the total tuition and other institutional charges. The first class day is not the first day of the student\u2019s class. Partial Withdrawals During Drop\/Add Period Students who do not completely withdraw from the institution but drop a class during the regular drop\/add period will be refunded the difference in tuition paid and the tuition rate applicable to the reduced number of hours, including fees appropriate to the classes dropped. Partial Withdrawals After Drop\/Add Period There is no refund due to a student who partially withdraws after the official drop\/add period. Complete Withdrawals A student who officially or unofficially withdraws completely on or after the first day of class but prior to the end of the third week of class will be refunded according to the withdrawal date, as follows: Withdrawal during first week \u2014 75% of tuition and other institutional charges Withdrawal during second week \u2014 50% of tuition and other institutional charges Withdrawal during third week \u2014 25% of tuition and other institutional charges Withdrawal after end of third week \u2014 No refund For calculating refunds during the fall and spring sixteen-week terms, a \u201Cweek\u201D is defined as seven calendar days. Refunds of tuition for terms shorter than sixteen weeks, such as summer terms, mini-terms, split terms, and weekend terms, will reflect a prorated week based on the number of days in the term. Administrative Fee An administrative fee not to exceed 5 percent of tuition and other institutional charges shall be assessed for each withdrawal within the period beginning the first day of class and ending at the end of the third week of class. Pass Through Fees Pass through fees such as music fees and allied health and nursing fees will not be refunded after the official drop\/add period. 1-800-626-3628 Toll-Free in Alabama Mailing Address P.O.
