He is now in his second year as the College\u2019s pre-law advisor, a role that fits well with Myers\u2019 own academic background, especially since he argues that philosophy is the best major for future law students. \u201CIn the data out there on majors that score highest on the LSAT, philosophy is at the top of the list every time,\u201D he says. \u201CBut you can major in anything and go to law school, and we have people major in everything and go to law school.\u201D Political science and business are often some of the most popular pre-law majors, but BSC\u2019s pre-law advising program provides guidance for students of all majors to explore careers in law and gain the critical thinking and writing skills they need going into the LSAT and the application process. Myers entered the position after Professor Emeritus of English Dr. Fred Ashe, who served as the pre-law program advisor from 2016 until his retirement in 2020. In 2019, Myers joined Ashe as a co-advisor to the program, which Ashe had grown over the last few years. The pre-law program is focused on advising students rather than requiring a set curriculum, though Myers does help students choose what courses would be best for them to take. He also serves as a mentor as pre-law students look for internships, study for the LSAT, and apply to and decide on different law schools. Myers first got involved in the program with the creation of the philosophy, history, and law major that he developed with Michael Atchison Professor of History Dr. Mark Lester. Students in the major can choose a philosophy track or a history track, creating a focus in those disciplines along with advanced writing, economics, accounting, and other relevant courses. For the major, Myers developed a course on the philosophy of law that he has now taught three times. The process required him to dig into texts he had not taught in years, but the course has quickly become one of his favorites. \u201CThe questions we ask are so diverse and varied,\u201D he says. \u201CWe go through the various theories of what law is. We talk about justice and equality, great issues that involve all areas of philosophy. It\u2019s a very expansive field \u2013 you can cover almost everything.\u201D The course overlaps with Myers\u2019 own research expertise in American philosophy, pragmatism, and ethics, and it is based on the reading and writing skills necessary for law school and for law professions. In the same way Myers\u2019 courses serve many different majors on the Hilltop, philosophy works well with all kinds of law-related professions. In his advising, Myers reviews students\u2019 personal statements and other parts of their law school applications and oversees pre-law internships during E-Term. All these experiences ensure that students\u2019 education at BSC can flow directly into their law school education. \u201CIt\u2019s not directly training the way a LSAT course would be; it\u2019s teaching you how to think that way.\u201D Law School Matriculations for Fall 2021 Ally Brinson \u201921, Cumberland School of Law James Crabbe \u201921, Creighton University School of Law McKenzie Driskell \u201921, Cumberland School of Law Leslie Dupre \u201912, New York Law School Samih Eloubeidi \u201918, Emory University School of Law Joshua Griffin \u201920, Charleston School of Law Atchison Hubbard \u201921, Cumberland School of Law Annabelle Kahalley \u201921, Baylor University School of Law Ethan Lay \u201921, Cumberland School of Law Chase Mays \u201921, Vanderbilt Law School Jay Maxa \u201921, Emory University School of Law Jeffrey McKinney \u201910, Charleston School of Law Mary Newman \u201919, University of Mississippi School of Law John C.
