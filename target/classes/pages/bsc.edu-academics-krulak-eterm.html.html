Exploration Term occurs each January when students take the month to engage in a single, intensive learning project, embodying the notion of learning for its own sake, providing students and faculty alike an opportunity to experiment, innovate, and explore. Students must complete at least two Exploration Term projects. They can do so in three ways: faculty-led travel projects, on campus projects, and independently designed projects. Why E-Term? Focus. A single, month-long project enables you to focus on a question or concern not possible during the regular term, including travel, intensive internships, and research. Depth. The intensity of Exploration Term allows for in-depth learning with a community of peers, combining hands-on activities with close-knit interaction. Wonder. Hitting the pause button on the regular term engages curiosity and wonder, expanding your creative and intellectual potential. High-payoff, low risk. Most Exploration Term projects have few, if any, prerequisites and need not be tied to the major or career (though they can be), enabling you to pursue interests for maximum payoff and low risk. Looking for the bulletin? The Exploration Term Bulletin includes all project listings for the most recent or upcoming Exploration Term. You can access the Bulletin here. Are you a faculty member proposing a future Exploration Term project? Faculty work with their department chairs and the Director of Exploration Term and Contract Learning to develop innovative Exploration Term projects, including travel projects, internships, and on-campus projects. The application form for new projects is available in the Forms section. Contact the Director of Exploration Term and Contract Learning to explore the possibilities. How should I spend my Exploration Term? Faculty-Led Travel Projects Choose from six to ten travel projects at domestic and international locations. Travel projects for the upcoming year are published in the annual travel bulletin each spring; students secure a space by placing a deposit and signing a financial agreement. Learn More On-Campus Projects Enroll in one of more than 60 on-campus projects with a range of challenging topics and innovative learning experiences. Registration for on-campus Exploration Term projects occurs in the fall term. Learn More Contracted Independent Projects Design an individualized learning experience; more than 30 students contract an experience each year. Collaborate with a faculty sponsor; completed contracts are due during the fall registration period. Learn More Dive Deeper: Faculty-Led Travel Projects Faculty-led study-travel Exploration Term projects combine learning with travel to national and international sites. In past projects, students studied ecology in the Gal?pagos Islands, examined the film industry by attending the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, investigated the roots of Modernity in Italy, researched agribusiness in the Czech Republic, and honed their teaching and mentoring skills with children in Uganda. Most study-travel projects enroll students of all levels. Students must be in good academic and social standing in order to participate. How do I enroll in a faculty-led travel project? Enrolling in a travel project is fairly straightforward: monitor the announcement of travel opportunities in the spring of each academic year, identify the project that is of most interest to you, make a deposit and sign the financial agreement, apply for scholarship funding, and then join your travel companions in January. Identify travel opportunities. Each spring, the Krulak Institute publishes a list of upcoming travel projects and opportunities for the following calendar year, including Exploration Term travel projects. A list of the most recent past or upcoming travel projects can be found here Select a travel project. Review the list of opportunities, reach out to faculty sponsors, and talk with others who may have participated in the project in the past to determine if the project is the right fit for you. Monitor Monday Morning and ENGAGE for interest sessions held in the spring and fall of each year where you can ask questions of travel leaders. Make a deposit. There are limited spaces on travel projects, and travel leaders need your commitment to ensure the project can go. As soon as you decide, contact Krulak Institute staff to make a deposit and sign the financial agreement. Doing so will ensure you have a space on a specific travel project. Make your deposit as soon as possible; the deadline is in late October. Travel. Once students are registered for a specific travel project, they will receive information from the travel leaders about airfare, lodging, and other travel expectations. Stay in touch with your travel leader and with your travel companions as you prepare for departure in January. On-Campus Projects Although students may remain on campus during Exploration term, the projects they complete require exploration. More than 60 on-campus projects are offered each term, including internship and research opportunities, as well as innovative courses that expand the repertoire of both faculty and students. Past projects have invited students to walk around Birmingham to better understand the city\u2019s history and habitat; to read contemporary best-selling novels; to learn sign language; to consider the relationship between crafting and social movements; to practice \u201Cunplugging\u201D from contemporary, fast-paced culture; or to examine how the Civil War has been depicted in film. Projects typically have few prerequisites, so students can use Exploration Term to explore new interests or curiosities. How do I enroll in on-campus projects? On-campus Exploration Term registration coincides with spring term registration. To register, review the options listed in the E-Term bulletin, make your selection, attend the preliminary orientation meeting in November, and then begin the project in January. Review Options. Early in the fall term, The Krulak Institute publishes an Exploration Term Bulletin that lists available projects for the following January. Students should review this bulletin prior to registration. The most recent or upcoming Exploration Term Bulletin can be found here Register. Students register for Exploration Term projects at the same time they register for spring term courses; however, the process differs for first-year students and upper-level students. First-year and newly admitted transfer students meet with academic advisors to learn about Exploration Term, review the bulletin, and consider options. Following this meeting, first-year students and transfers submit their top project preferences to the Krulak Institute and are placed in one of these choices. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors register for Exploration Term using Self-Service at the same time that they register for their spring term courses. Attend Information Session. In November, all registered students attend an introductory orientation session where they meet with their Exploration Term project leader, learn about the project, and prepare for January. Begin the Project. Projects begin in January. Work with your project leader to verify expectations prior to the start of January. Contracted Independent Exploration Term Projects Students are encouraged to imagine and to initiate their own contracted projects for Exploration Term, including travel projects and internships. Contracted experiences allow students to pursue an interest not offered through regular coursework, creating a course of study in collaboration with a faculty sponsor. Past student contracts projects have studied wildlife conservation at a rhino sanctuary in South Africa or investigated business models of bakeries throughout the Southeast. Projects should be substantial investments of time and effort, taking advantage of the focus of January to research, write, talk with and collaborate with experts, and engage in careful observation and analysis. How do I contract a project? Information on how to contract an internship can be found here. Information on how to contract an independent study project can be found here. Information on how to contract a travel project can be found here. Exploration Term Travel Awards Scholarship funding is available to students engaged in domestic or international study during Exploration Term, including students participating in faculty-led travel projects and those contracting their own travel experience. Faculty-Led Travel Awards The application form for scholarships for faculty-led travel projects is available on ENGAGE and due in September. Preference will be given to applicants who have demonstrated financial need, demonstrated a financial commitment (i.e. students who have made a deposit), students who have not previously traveled for E-Term, and to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. First-year students are encouraged to remain on campus for their first term. Contracted Travel Awards Applications for scholarship support for contracted travel projects are due at the time students submit their contract in October. The application requires an itemized budget and itinerary. Support for these projects is provided by the SGA and other endowed funds. Preference will be given to applicants who have demonstrated financial need, students who have not previously traveled for E-Term, an itemized budget and itinerary, and to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. First-year students cannot contract for Exploration Term. Contracted travel projects that include community service will be eligible for the Koinonia Scholarship. Applications for contracted experiences are automatically considered for the Koinonia if students have completed the question related to service-learning. This award provides financial support to a student or group of students who independently contract an Exploration Term project concentrating on service issues in the global community. The Neal R. Berte Koinonia Scholarship for Student-Contracted Service-Learning Travel was created by students to honor the silver anniversary of Birmingham-Southern\u2019s 11th president, Dr. Neal R. Berte. Koinonia refers to fellowship or communion with God or with others. Exploration Term Bulletin Information Exploration Term Travel Bulletin Travel Projects for January 2023 can be found here.
