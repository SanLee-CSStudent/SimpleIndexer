Only a limited amount of work in business courses is offered below the junior year. The objective of this policy is to permit the student to acquire a foundation of work in the basic arts and sciences as prerequisites for professional courses in business. All business programs accredited by the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business require the student to take a minimum of 40 percent of the four-years\u2019 work in the arts and sciences, including work in mathematics, social science, humanities, and the natural sciences. Students desiring a four-year degree are advised to take a majority of their work during the first two years in the arts and sciences, including a strong background in mathematics. Students planning to take their first two years\u2019 work at a community college or at another four-year college should take only those courses in business that are offered as freshman or sophomore level courses at any of the three universities. Full lower division transfer credit will be granted for all courses equivalent to those specified for the freshman and sophomore years at any one of the three four-year state universities in Arizona. Professional business courses taught in the junior and senior years in the three state universities may not be completed for transfer credit at any community college. Courses taught as occupational or career classes at the community colleges, even though similar to professional courses offered at the junior and senior levels at the three universities, will not be accepted for credit toward a bachelor\u2019s degree. A one-semester course in business law will be accepted as an exception to this policy.
