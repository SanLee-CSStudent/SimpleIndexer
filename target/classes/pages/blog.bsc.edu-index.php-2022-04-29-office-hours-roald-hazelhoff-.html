If you walk or drive toward the west end of campus, passing the residence halls, the lake, and then the intermural fields, you\u2019ll find the four-acre oasis of native plants and recycled art. The EcoScape garden and outdoor classroom celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2021 and is one example of Hazelhoff\u2019s work to make BSC a more sustainable and beautiful place. A Holland native and past resident of Japan and Hong Kong, Hazelhoff has lived in Birmingham since 1988, when he joined BSC as an assistant professor of political science. It didn\u2019t take long to push students outdoors. \u201CI became feared on campus because there was no chance of passing if you didn\u2019t help plant trees,\u201D he says. As quickly as Hazelhoff spearheaded environmental efforts on campus, his work was recognized at the national level. The College received the Point of Light Award on Earth Day in 1990 from President George H.W. Bush, who visited campus to honor students, faculty, and staff for their work to beautify surrounding neighborhoods and educate young students in the community. Hazelhoff formally transitioned to his current role in 1992 as founder and director of the Southern Environmental Center, and he\u2019s made the entire campus greener. Alongside the Hess Center and the Department of Biology, he helped found the major and minor in environmental science; he made campus buildings more energy efficient; with the help of BSC students, he planted more than 1,000 trees; and he beautified areas across campus, including the corner that is now the EcoScape and the landscaping around Clay C. Long Alumni Plaza. \u201CNow, you have a pedestrian-friendly campus and a reason to be outside,\u201D Hazelhoff says. \u201CThe Residence Quad is connected to the Academic Quad. And by virtue of the lake, we are connected to the recreational components.\u201D In the EcoScape, you\u2019ll find lush greens, native plants, edible plants \u2013 like figs and different herbs, depending on the time of year \u2013 and maybe a few critters. Hazelhoff recently spotted a red-tailed hawk surrounded by crows. \u201CThere\u2019s always something to see and color throughout the year,\u201D he says. \u201CFor fall, you can look for asters that come out, and the crepe myrtles are always beautiful in early fall. As some of the vegetation dies back, you discover and appreciate the things that were once obscured. You can see owls, hawks, rabbits, and our fox family.\u201D Hazelhoff welcomes everyone to the EcoScape \u2013 students, faculty and their classes, and the Birmingham community. All Southern Environmental Center programs are designed for visitors to learn about and enjoy the environment. \u201CWe\u2019ve been given space on campus to do some creative things that benefited the campus as well as the community,\u201D he says.
