Along with sharing careers in medicine, Freeman, her younger brother, vascular surgery resident Dr. Adam Banks \u201916, and their father, obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Greg Banks \u201983, all experienced a Birmingham-Southern liberal arts education, one that has worked closely with their medical school experience to prepare them as doctors. Freeman is currently completing her three-year neonatology fellowship, following her graduation from UAB School of Medicine and pediatric residency at UAB. Though she initially wanted to become an orthopedic surgeon, her med school rotation in the neonatal intensive care unit changed her path. \u201CIt\u2019s such a new field, and there are always new discoveries on the best ways to take care of our babies,\u201D she says. \u201CEven in the last 10 or 20 years, we\u2019ve had so much development on the youngest gestational age at which we would intervene.\u201D In her fellowship, which she began in 2019, Freeman spends four to five months of the year in clinicals at the Children\u2019s of Alabama Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or the UAB Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Outside of her clinical rotations, she works on research. BSC played an important role in how to manage different areas of her job, Freeman says. As a biology major, she completed genetics research with Dr. Pamela Hanson, former professor of biology, that allowed her to investigate what kind of medicine she might pursue. She also became close with the science departments and found guidance from her mentor, Dr. Clyde Stanton, professor of chemistry. Freeman\u2019s science course work \u2013 which her father and brother also completed at BSC as chemistry and biology majors, respectively \u2013 was paired with the chance to explore topics outside of her pre-med studies. Those experiences also affect the way Freeman interacts with patients daily. Art history courses and a literature course with Dr. Michael McInturff, professor of English, were some of her favorites. \u201CA well-rounded education gives you the ability to relate to people on so many levels,\u201D Freeman says. \u201CIt helps you build rapport with patients and relate to them going forward, and that is one of the most valuable parts of my education.\u201D Freeman sees her education in action throughout her neonatology fellowship as she gets to know her patients, and her relationships become just as important as research and procedures. \u201CIn the neonatal ICU, families may be there just a few days with term babies that have low blood sugars, but then there are families who are there for a year or more,\u201D she says. \u201CBeing able to counsel them and teach them through having a new baby \u2013 what should be the happiest time in their lives but can be some of the hardest times of their life, is one of the things I enjoy the most about the field, and one of the things that drove me to pursue it.\u201D Freeman encourages current BSC students interested in medicine to take advantage of challenging classes within and far outside of their majors. This range in her courses and the close-knit biology community made the Hilltop like her family away from home \u2013 though her brother was not far behind her \u2013 and prepared her for both medical school and the multifaceted aspects of her career afterwards. \u201CYou don\u2019t think about the long hours when you\u2019re taking care of your patients because the most important thing to you is to take the best care possible, whether it\u2019s my pre-term babies or Adam\u2019s surgical patients or my dad\u2019s OBGYN practice,\u201D Freeman says. \u201CTaking care of your patients becomes your focus.\u201D This story was included in a special health careers edition of From the Hilltop, Birmingham-Southern\u2019s alumni email newsletter.
